KKR & Co LLP nears deal to acquire WebMD Health Corp - sources

Private equity firm KKR & Co LLP (KKR.N) is nearing an all-cash deal to acquire WebMD Health Corp (WBMD.O), a U.S. online health publisher with a market capitalization of $2.1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The deal would bring under one roof WebMD's websites, such as WebMD.com, Medscape.com and MedicineNet.com, with those owned by another KKR company, Internet Brands Inc, including DentalPlans.com, VeinDirectory.org and AllAboutCounseling.com.
WebMD is close to agreeing to a deal to sell itself to KKR after running a five-month auction and soliciting bids from more than 100 companies and private equity firms, the people said. The deal is expected to be announced by Monday, the people added.
The exact price KKR was offering could not be learned.
WebMD declined to comment, and KKR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A deal would make WebMD the latest healthcare media company to be sold. In December, j2 Global Inc's (JCOM.O) digital media arm Ziff Davis LLC acquired Everyday Health Inc, a U.S. operator of health-related websites, for $465 million, including debt.
Founded in 1996, WebMD has grown into one of the most popular health websites for consumers and medical professionals, attracting more than 70 million monthly unique visitors in 2016, according to analytics company comScore Inc (SCOR.PK).
WebMD also owns medical news and education brand Medscape, which accounted for around 60 percent of its advertising revenue in 2016.
The New York-based company said in February it would explore its options, after a slowdown in advertising paid for by pharmaceutical companies. Activist hedge funds Blue Harbor Group and Jana Partners subsequently disclosed stakes in WebMD.
 Internet Brands, which launched as CarsDirect.com in 1998, licenses and delivers its content and internet technology products and services to small and medium-sized businesses. It was acquired by KKR in 2014 for $1.1 billion from two other private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman LLC and JMI Equity.
 
Under KKR, the company has expanded its portfolio of brands to include Demandforce and Fodor's Travel.

It was acquired by KKR in 2014 for $1.1 billion from two other private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman LLC and JMI Equity.
 
Under KKR, the company has expanded its portfolio of brands to include Demandforce and Fodor's Travel.

Here's Why WebMD Health Corp. Is Soaring Today
Shares jumped after the health information services company announced that it is being taken private.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)



            
            Jul 24, 2017 at 12:04PM
            
            





What happened
The trading week began pleasantly for shareholders in WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ:WBMD). The health information services provider's stock price was up more than 19% as of 11:52 a.m. EDT Monday after the company announced that it is being taken private.
So what
Internet Brands, a portfolio company of the global investment firm KKR, has agreed to acquire WebMD for $2.8 billion. The deal values WebMD at $66.50 per share, which represents a 20% premium over Friday's closing price.

WebMD's board of directors has already approved the transaction, and financing for the deal is already fully committed. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
"We believe that this transaction will provide additional flexibility and resources to deliver increased value to consumers, healthcare professionals, employers, and health plan participants, said WebMD CEO Dr. Steven L. Zatz.
Bob Brisco, CEO of Internet Brands, was also excited about the deal and heaped high praise on the company:

"Since its founding, WebMD has established itself as a trusted resource for health information. We look forward to delivering that resource to even more users, by leveraging our combined resources and presence in online healthcare to catalyze WebMD's future growth."






Now what
Since this deal has already been given the thumbs up by WebMD's board and is fully financed it seems highly likely that it will go through without much trouble. With shares currently trading within $0.50 of the buyout price, it likely makes sense for shareholders to take the victory lap and cash in their chips today. Afterward, they should think about using their proceeds to invest in other promising healthcare companies.

		WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) Stock Shoots Higher on KKR Deal	
KKR will pay $66.50 per share for WBMD

Jul 24, 2017, 10:53 am EDT  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer



 
 

WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ:WBMD) stock was on the rise today following news of a deal with portfolio company KKR.

The deal will have KKR acquiring WebMD Health Corp. for $66.50 per share. This places a value that is a 30% premium over WBMD stock’s closing price on Feb. 15, 2017, which was the last day before it announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives. It is also 20% above WBMD stock’s closing price for July 21, 2017.
The total value of the deal between KKR and WebMD Health Corp. is $2.8 billion. KKR is using cash to buyout WBMD stock and it has secured the majority money from its private equity funds. It also notes that the financing for the deal is fully committed.  The company will use a subsidiary of Internet Brands to place a tender offer for all WMBD shares within the next 10 business days.
WebMD Health Corp.’s Baord of Directors have already given their approval to the merger with KKR. WBMD Chairman Martin Wygod said that the company is “confident that this transaction maximizes value for our stockholders.”
WebMD Health Corp. is getting legal advice from Shearman & Sterling LLP and financial advice from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Internet Brands is getting its legal advice from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.
WebMD Health Corp. says that it expects the deal with KKR to close during the fourth quarter of 2017. However, it will first have to complete customary closing conditions before it can do so.
WBMD stock was up 19% as of Monday morning and is up 33% year-to-date.
As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Our services for consumers enable them to obtain information on health and wellness topics or on a particular disease or condition, to assess their personal health status, to use online trackers, tools and quizzes, to locate physicians, to receive periodic e-mailed newsletters and alerts on topics of individual interest, and to participate in online communities with peers and experts. Our services for physicians and healthcare professionals make it easier for them to access clinical reference sources, stay abreast of the latest clinical information, learn about new treatment options, earn continuing medical education (which we refer to as CME) credit and communicate with peers. We do not charge any usage, membership or download fees for access to the Websites and mobile apps included in The WebMD Health Network. We generate revenue from The WebMD Health Network primarily through the sale of various types of advertising and sponsorship programs to our clients, which include: pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies; hospitals, clinics and other healthcare services companies; health insurance providers; consumer products companies whose products or services relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention; and various other businesses, organizations and governmental entities. Advertisers and sponsors use our services to reach, educate and inform target audiences of consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also generate revenue from advertising sold in WebMD Magazine, a consumer magazine distributed to physician office waiting rooms.  Health Services. Under the WebMD Health Services brand, we market wellness services and solutions that help employers and health plans improve the health and well-being of their employee and plan participant populations. We host our WebMD Health Servicesplatform for our employer and health plan clients. Our cloud-based online services can be accessed by their employees and plan participants using a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. Our flexible architecture allows us to integrate with the client's existing programs, websites and intranets. Our services help our clients' employees and plan participants make informed decisions about health risks and lifestyle choices. Our solutions start with an assessment of individual health and well-being and then work to provide personalized paths for improving or maintaining health. We also offer clients the ability to design team-based and individual wellness challenges that help foster a culture of wellness in the workplace. In addition, our health and wellness coaching programs, available onsite and telephonically and focusing on lifestyle, condition management, weight management and tobacco cessation, help participants make healthier choices to achieve their health and well-being goals. Our WebMD Digital Health AssistantSM offers online, self-directed health coaching which enables participants to set and track wellness goals and follow self-paced personal action plans. We generate Health Services revenue from employer and health plan subscriptions to our WebMD Health Services platform, either directly or through distributor relationships. In addition, clients are charged on a per participant basis for our health and wellness coaching programs.  Information Services. We generate revenue from the sale of certain information products and services on a stand-alone basis using de-identified data that we license from a small number of third-party data sources, of which the principal source is a license from Change Healthcare to HLTH Corporation (or HLTH), our former parent company. As the successor to HLTH, this license provides us the rights to certain de-identified data from Change Healthcare through early February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services. Customers for these information services include data services, informatics and consulting companies. Our revenue from the products and services that utilize data under the current Change Healthcare license is highly profitable and is reported net of the royalties and commissions that we pay to Change Healthcare or others. We do not expect that the current license agreement with Change Healthcare will continue after February 2018, and expect that if such agreement is replaced with new third-party data sources, the terms of any such replacement license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current agreement. Discussions around extending our agreement with Change Healthcare have stalled. In addition, as described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, Change Healthcare filed a lawsuit in April 2017 challenging WebMD's rights under the license agreement to continue to use the data delivered to WebMD during the term of the agreement, after the agreement's termination in early February 2018. We are exploring other sources of third-party data and uses of our first party data to generate additional revenue streams, but we are early in that process. Accordingly, we expect that the sales of, and the profits generated by, our information services business will be materially adversely affected by the termination, in early February 2018, of our license agreement with Change Healthcare.  Table of Contents  Background Information on Certain Trends and Developments Affecting Our Business. Key trends and developments affecting the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing and our ability to generate revenue from those services include the following:   Online Marketing and Education Spending for Healthcare Products. Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them; however, only a small portion is currently spent on online services. We believe that these companies, which represented approximately 76% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in 2016, are aware of the effectiveness of the Internet relative to traditional media in providing health, clinical and product-related information to consumers and physicians. In addition, in an effort to improve operating efficiencies, some pharmaceutical companies have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years.  - We believe that we are well-positioned to provide advertising solutions for pharmaceutical products that are currently being marketed as well as those in the pipeline for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Many of these pharmaceutical products are expensive therapies that treat complex conditions affecting relatively small patient populations, for which we believe that our online services provide an efficient way to reach target audiences.  - However, notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand, we cannot predict the extent or the pace of any shift by pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies of their marketing expenditures to online services or to what extent they will choose WebMD to provide such services. In addition, some of our pharmaceutical company customers have experienced patent expirations for certain of their products in the past several years and some are expected to experience patent expirations over the next several years. In the pharmaceutical industry, patent expirations allow for competition from lower-priced generic versions of the patented drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug and, in certain instances, have resulted in reductions in the overall online advertising budgets for some of our customers.   Trends Affecting the Pharmaceutical Industry. The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. The expectations of pharmaceutical companies regarding pending or potential industry developments may affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to services of the types we provide. Since 2016, there has been increasing scrutiny regarding pricing and profitability for pharmaceutical products, which could lead to additional regulation of such pricing or other changes in how those products are distributed and the roles played by various industry participants in that distribution, including significant changes in how drugs are procured for government-funded programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our pharmaceutical company customers are assessing the implications of potential changes for their businesses and we believe that some may, in light of the uncertainty regarding the nature and timing of any such changes, be delaying or deferring deployment of their marketing budgets. We cannot predict the effect that any resulting changes may have on the marketing plans of our customers in future periods or their future use of our services. For additional discussion, see "-Healthcare Reform" below.   Healthcare Reform. Political, economic, regulatory and enforcement influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the various healthcare entities with which we do business. In particular, we anticipate that the U.S. Executive Branch, U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the ongoing scrutiny regarding healthcare pricing in the U.S. generally, and prescription drug pricing specifically. Such policies could limit the prices our advertisers and sponsors charge for their healthcare-related products or services, limit the commercial opportunities of our advertisers and sponsors and negatively impact revenues collected by our advertisers and sponsors. However, the nature and timing of any  Table of Contents  One law with a significant impact on the healthcare industry is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the Affordable Care Act). The Affordable Care Act made extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the U.S. While we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects as a direct result of the application of the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer, we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts will be on WebMD's business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of The WebMD Health Network and employers and health plans that license our WebMD Health Services platform. Healthcare industry participants may respond to uncertainties created by the potential statutory and regulatory changes to the Affordable Care Act by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services.   Factors That May Cause Our Advertising and Sponsorship Revenue to Vary from Quarter to Quarter. Our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, including economic and regulatory conditions generally and those specifically affecting healthcare industry participants, as well as the following:  - The majority of our advertising and sponsorship commitments are for terms of approximately four to twelve months. We have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship commitments.  - The time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contractual commitment with the advertiser or sponsor for that program, as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered, may be longer than expected, especially for medium-sized and larger contracts, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals, including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products. We have experienced, from time to time in the past, a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which has resulted in delays in contracting, as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts, and we cannot predict whether similar delays may occur in future periods.  Additional factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors, or receipt of revenue under such contracts, include: the timing of FDA approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products; the timing of FDA approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of products from the market; consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; the timing of roll-outs of new or enhanced services for The WebMD Health Network; seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products; and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals.   Other Factors Affecting the Demand for Our Advertising and Sponsorship Services. Advertiser and sponsor clients of The WebMD Health Network also include companies that provide over-the-counter drugs and other healthcare products, food and beverages, beauty products and other consumer products, particularly for products and services that relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention, as well as clients such as retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, health insurance companies  Table of Contents   Considerations Regarding Traffic to The WebMD Health Network. Traffic to Medscape properties from physicians worldwide averaged approximately 8.7 million physician sessions per month in first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately 13% over the prior year period. Physicians generally come directly to Medscape properties, rather than through search. During the first quarter of 2017, an average of approximately 403,000 U.S. physicians were active on Medscape monthly. We also reach a total of approximately 2 million other healthcare professionals in the U.S. annually and a total of approximately 1.7 million physicians outside the U.S. annually.  According to comScore, The WebMD Health Network reached an average of approximately 74 million users per month (combining desktop and mobile users on a de-duplicated basis) in the first quarter of 2017, which was approximately the same as in the prior year period. In recent quarters, we have seen declines in the number of search referrals we have received from Google and this has impacted the aggregate traffic to our consumer sites. However, we have offset much of the decline with growth in direct sources of traffic.  Overall traffic to The WebMD Health Network is not correlated to our advertising and sponsorship revenue. With respect to our Websites for consumers, we create content on specific topics and program various portions to build and maintain traffic in the areas most important to our advertising and sponsorship clients. In addition, while the total Medscape audience is small compared to the total audience of The WebMD Health Network, Medscape Websites and mobile apps contributed approximately 60% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in recent periods because of the high value our clients place on being able to reach the Medscape audience of physicians and other healthcare professionals or to reach targeted portions of that Medscape audience.   Social Media and Video Initiatives. Given the increasing prominence of social networks as important platforms for finding and consuming content, WebMD is working to enable users to more easily discover, share and interact with content from WebMD, not just on our own Websites, but also in other online locations. Some of our initiatives are directed toward the creation of new content offerings that are tailored for specific social networks and platforms. Our strategy to extend our content and brand beyond The WebMD Health Network will, in some cases, allow us to drive people back to WebMD's sites, where we can monetize that traffic as we do today; in other cases, we may be able to take advantage of new monetization opportunities as we engage with users outside of WebMD's sites. Another key aspect of these initiatives is to create video content that is both highly engaging and easily sharable across social networks. We are also continuing to develop longer-form video offerings, such as our multi-episode clinical series, Medscape TV, which utilizes nationally recognized thought leaders to discuss important topics in medicine for a physician audience.   Trends Affecting Our Services for Employers and Health Plans. In response to increasing healthcare costs, public and private sector employers and health plans have been changing benefit plan designs to increase deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs and taking other steps to motivate employees and plan participants to live healthier lives and use healthcare in a cost-effective manner. In connection with shifting greater responsibility for healthcare costs to employees and plan participants, employers and health plans are making available more health and benefits information and decision- support applications to help their employees and plan participants make informed decisions about  Table of Contents   International. Physicians and healthcare professionals from around the world access our content in English through Medscape. In addition, we publish Spanish, French, Portuguese and German language editions of Medscape through which healthcare professionals can access our content in those languages. We have also entered into collaborations with companies having expertise in a specific country or region to extend our reach. We plan to continue to pursue opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the United States, particularly with respect to our healthcare professionals audience. In certain markets outside the United States, we expect to accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region, while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources.   Other Initiatives. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to identify, new business opportunities where our consumer and physician audiences and our resources can be leveraged to develop additional products and services. We may pursue initiatives to create new or enhanced revenue streams or, alternatively, to increase audience engagement even when we have not identified any potential related revenue stream. New business initiatives present risks and challenges that may be different from the ones we have faced in the past. In addition, later events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time decisions are made on specific initiatives. Failure to effectively identify and assess new business initiatives and to successfully implement them may adversely affect our company and its prospects.  The healthcare industry in the United States and relationships among healthcare payers, providers and consumers are very complicated. In addition, the Internet and the market for online and mobile services are relatively new and still evolving. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our business from our responses to those trends will be achieved. In addition, the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends, but the trends may also attract additional competitors.  Background Information on Certain Significant Developments and Transactions  Exploration of Strategic Alternatives. On February 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and legal and financial advisors, had commenced a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. These alternatives could include, among other things, the sale of part or all of our company, a merger with another party, other types of strategic transactions, or continuing to execute on WebMD's business plan. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, that process is ongoing and our Board has not set a specific date for its completion. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction.  As described under "-Convertible Notes" below, WebMD has outstanding convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.06 billion. The effect on the convertible notes of any potential transaction relating to the exploration of strategic alternatives would depend on the specific timing, structure and terms of such transaction, including (among other things) the type and amount of any consideration received, and may also depend on  Table of Contents  . . .

SAN DIEGO, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson & Weaver, LLP (J&W) has launched an investigation into whether the board members of WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ:    WBMD) ("WebMD") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to KKR's Internet Brands ("Internet Brands"). 
On July 24, 2017, WebMD announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Internet Brands. Terms of the deal call for shareholders to receive $66.50 per share for each share of WebMD stock they own.








The investigation concerns whether the WebMD board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for WebMD shares of common stock. Nationally recognized Johnson & Weaver is investigating whether the proposed deal price represents adequate consideration. According to Yahoo! Finance, at least one Wall Street analyst's estimated price target is $72.00 per share.
If you are a shareholder of WebMD and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker (jimb@johnsonandweaver.com) at 619-814-4471.
