 At JD Products Inc We Are Your Experienced Injection Molding Experts


























































We Are ISO 9001:2008 CertifiedPhone: (651) 483-9166














 










How We Became Injection Molding Experts

JD Products Inc was founded and began operations in 1974 by James Denney, Sr. It is currently owned and operated by the second generation, James Denney, Jr. and John Denney. We began as a family owned business and intend to keep it that way in order to provide our customers and clients with the kind of service that entails.
Both James and John have been involved with the business almost since it began. They started off in 1976 operating the presses on weekends and during summers. Since then they’ve been able to work their way up through the organization. This means that they understand nearly every aspect of what we do here at JD Products. Being on the ground and in the trenches, in addition to their management roles, has given them a level of experience that is unparalleled in the injection molding industry. They certainly have the knowledge that allows them to live up to the title of injection molding experts.
Over the years, we’ve grown at JD Products due to our quality of service and experience. In 1995 we expanded to a 45,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Vadnais Heights, Minnesota. By building and owning this location, we have been able to meet the increasing demand for our injection molding services. Then, in October 2011 we grew once again when we acquired Northland Tool and moved the tool shop into our building. With this growth and expansion, we are better able to serve a variety of industries, including filtration, agriculture, dental, health care, recreation, automotive, construction, and electronics. In addition, we are capable and experienced in processing everything from commodity to engineering grade thermoplastics, including high temperature polymers like PEEK.
We are also ISO 9001:2008 certified since 2004 and are committed to providing quality custom injection molding services and JIT delivery at competitive prices.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately US$1,248 million 
from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated 
offering expenses payable by us and net proceeds of approximately US$1,309 
million from the concurrent private placement to Huang River Investment Limited,
after deducting the placement fee payable by us. If the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full and Huang River Investment Limited exercises
its option to further subscribe to Class A ordinary shares to maintain the 5% 
proportionate size of the concurrent private placement, these numbers would 
increase to US$1,504 million and US$1,323 million, respectively.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement as follows:

.  approximately US$1.0 billion to US$1.2 billion over the next three years to 
   expand our fulfillment infrastructure by acquiring land use rights, building 
   new warehouses and purchasing vehicles for shipping and delivery; and

.  the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential 
   investments and acquisitions of complementary businesses, assets and 
   technologies.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans 
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. 
Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to 
apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or 
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and 
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiaries in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to other subsidiaries in China and our consolidated variable interest
entities only through loans, subject to the approval of government authorities
and limit on the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, we
may extend inter-company loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China
or make additional capital contributions to these subsidiaries to fund their
capital expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered capital
of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries, we need to obtain approval from the
Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts, which will decide within 90 days
after receiving the application. If we provide funding to any of our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiaries through loans, the total amount of such loans may not
exceed the difference between the entity's total investment as approved by the
foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be
registered with SAFE or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working
days to complete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling 
shareholders.


The online retail industry in China is intensely competitive. Our current
or potential competitors include (i) major online retailers in China that offer
a wide range of general merchandise product categories, such as Alibaba Group,
which operates taobao.com and tmall.com, and Amazon China, which operates
amazon.cn, and (ii) major traditional retailers in China that are moving into
online retailing, such as Suning Appliance Company Limited, which operates
suning.com, Walmart, which holds a majority interest in yihaodian.com, and Gome
Electrical Appliances, which operates gome.com.cn. We also face competition from
online retail companies in China focused on specific product categories and from
physical retail stores, including big-box stores like RT-Mart that also aim to
offer a one-stop shopping experience.

We anticipate that the online retail market will continually evolve and will 
continue to experience rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, 
shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation. We must continually 
innovate to remain competitive. We believe that the principal competitive 
factors in our industry are:

.  brand recognition and reputation;

.  product quality and selection;

.  pricing;

.  fulfillment capabilities; and

.  customer service.

In addition, new and enhanced technologies may increase the competition in the 
online retail industry. New competitive business models may appear, for example 
based on new forms of social media or social commerce.

We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete on the basis of 
the factors listed above. However, some of our current or future competitors 
may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier 
relationships, larger customer bases or greater financial, technical or 
marketing resources than we do.


Company Description
We are the largest online direct sales company in China in terms of transaction 
volume in 2013, with a market share in China of 46.5%, according to iResearch, 
a third-party market research firm. Our gross merchandise volume, or GMV, 
increased from RMB32.7 billion in 2011 to RMB73.3 billion in


 2012 and
RMB125.5 billion (US$20.7 billion) in 2013.

We believe we provide consumers an enjoyable online retail experience. Through 
our content-rich and user-friendly website www.jd.com and mobile applications, 
we offer a wide selection of authentic products at competitive prices which are 
delivered in a speedy and reliable manner. We also offer convenient online and 
in-person payment options and comprehensive customer services. In order to have 
better control over fulfillment and to ensure customer satisfaction, we have 
built our own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure and last-mile delivery 
network, staffed by our own employees, which supports both our online direct 
sales and our online marketplace businesses. We have established strong 
relationships with our suppliers as we develop our online direct sales business.
Leveraging our strengths, we launched our online marketplace business in 2010, 
which has allowed us to significantly expand our selection of products and 
services.

As a result of our superior customer experience, our business has grown rapidly.
The number of products we offer through our online direct sales and marketplace 
has grown from approximately 1.5 million stock keeping units, or SKUs, as of 
December 31, 2011 to approximately 7.2 million SKUs as of December 31, 2012 to 
approximately 25.7 million as of December 31, 2013 and further to approximately 
40.2 million as of March 31, 2014. Electronics products and home appliances 
accounted for 80.1%, 65.3% and 63.6% of our total GMV in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 
respectively, and general merchandise and others for 19.9%, 34.7% and 36.4%.

We foster an interactive user community that discusses, rates and reviews
our products and services. We believe we have the largest online product review
database of any online direct sales company in China with approximately
297 million product reviews generated by our customers to date. We had
12.5 million, 29.3 million and 47.4 million active customer accounts and
fulfilled approximately 65.9 million, 193.8 million and 323.3 million orders in
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Timely and reliable fulfillment is critical to the success of an online retail 
business. Given the underdevelopment of third-party fulfillment services in 
China in terms of both warehousing and logistics facilities and last-mile
delivery services, we made a strategic decision in 2007 to build and operate our
own nationwide fulfillment infrastructure. We believe we have the largest
fulfillment infrastructure of any e-commerce company in China. We operated 86
warehouses with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 1.5 million
square meters in 36 cities and 1,620 delivery stations and 214 pickup stations
in 495 cities across China as of March 31, 2014, and had 24,412 delivery
personnel, 11,145 warehouse staff and 5,832 customer service personnel as of
April 1, 2014. Leveraging this nationwide fulfillment infrastructure, we deliver
a majority of the orders directly to customers ourselves, over 70% of which were
delivered on the day the order was placed or the day after. As of March 31,
2014, we provided same-day delivery in 43 cities under our 211 program and
next-day delivery in another 256 cities across China.

We are a technology-driven company and have invested heavily in developing our 
own highly scalable proprietary technology platform that supports our rapid 
growth and enables us to provide value-added technology services. Our 
technology platform currently has the capacity to process up to 30 million 
orders per day and record the status of 1.5 billion SKUs. In addition, our 
sophisticated business intelligence system enables us to refine our merchandise 
sourcing strategy to manage our inventory turnover and control costs and to 
leverage our large customer database to create customized product 
recommendations and cost-effective and targeted advertising.

We introduced our online marketplace to leverage our brand recognition, large 
and growing customer base, extensive transaction data, fulfillment
infrastructure and proprietary technology platform. Our online marketplace
allows us to provide customers a much greater selection of products. As of
March 31, 2014, our online marketplace accounted for approximately 37.8 million
of the approximately 40.2 million SKUs offered on our website. Our online direct
sales and marketplace businesses together made us the second largest B2C
e-commerce company in China, with a 23.3% market share based on transaction
volume in the first quarter of 2014, according to iResearch. We attract and
select third-party sellers to offer authentic products to our customers through
our online marketplace. We monitor third-party sellers' performance and
activities on our online marketplace closely to ensure that they meet our
requirements for authentic products and high-quality customer service. In
addition to basic transaction processing and billing services, we offer
third-party sellers a suite of value-added fulfillment and other services.

Our business has grown substantially in recent years. Our total net revenues 
increased from RMB21.1 billion in 2011 to RMB41.4 billion in 2012 and
RMB69.3 billion (US$11.5 billion) in 2013. We had net losses of RMB1.3 billion,
RMB1.7 billion and RMB0.05 billion (US$8 million) in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively.

JD.com, Inc. is a holding company and does not directly own all of the
entities through which we carry out our business operations. The PRC government
regulates foreign ownership and imposes licensing and permit requirements for
companies that offer value-added telecommunications services, distribute books
and audio and video products and provide online payment services. To comply with
these restrictions, we operate our website and mobile applications, sell books
and audio and video products and provide online payment services through our
variable interest entities in China. Our variable interest entities contributed
2.2%, 3.2% and 2.9% of our consolidated total revenues in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
respectively. These variable interest entities hold the permits and licenses
necessary for us to conduct our business in China. We face risks and
uncertainties associated with our corporate structure, as our control over these
variable interest entities is based on contractual arrangements rather than
equity ownership.

					PR159 - Clean Walker EASY Sticky Mat

 

 

 





		Saturday, 01 September 2012 10:17	






When it comes to using conventional “peel-off” type tacky mats, are you truly satisfied with how well it cleans, how much garbage it accumulates, and if it’s eco-friendly?  More importantly, how about the high running costs? 
	 

As a solution, we are proud to introduce VESSEL’s New “Clean-Walker-EASY” Reusable Sticky Mat (Model# CW-900EZ).
	 

	Unlike most conventional peel-off tacky mats, the “Clean Walker Easy” is constructed of a gel-like polyurethane material and its strong adhesive power effectively removes contaminants from the bottom of shoes and wheels.  Its elastic surface picks up dust and dirt particles in hard to reach areas such as in the tiny grooves on the bottom of shoes and on the outer edges of wheels from trolleys and carts.
	 

	Install at the entrance of clean rooms, in air shower booths, for cleaning trolley wheels, etc.  Ideal in facilities manufacturing semiconductors, electronics, precision devices, foodstuffs, packaging materials, in printing or painting plants, in pharmaceutical and medical facilities, etc.
	 

	The CW-900EZ is composed of a three-layer structure with a non-woven fabric core, which results in high durability to prevent tears under the pressure of trollies and carts being rolled over the mat.   Also, the low-profile 1/8” (3mm) thickness will not obstruct doors when opening and closing.  The front and backside of the mat are both adhesive so you can install on either side and flip the mat over when one surface gets dirty.
	 

	This Eco-Friendly product is truly reusable.  It’s an efficient and cost-effective solution when compared to the conventional disposable “peel-off” sticky mats that require a yearly running cost. The Clean Walker can last up to three years and potentially pay for itself over a short period of time.
	 

	The VESSEL Clean Walker easily cleans with water!  When the mat becomes dirty, simply clean off the surface with tap water using a mop, a squeegee, or a damp cloth.  Also, the mat is designed into two separate tiles which makes it easy for an operator to pick the mat off the floor, bring it to a sink for washing, and it can be hung to dry using the built-in “hook-holes”.  The adhesive power returns once the mat is fully dried. The CW-900EZ comes with two individual tiles covering a total area of 19.7"W x 35.4"L, is 1/8” thick, weighs approximately 3.5 lbs, and is RoHS compliant.


	To find out more information about the VESSEL Clean Walker Reusable Sticky Mat (model# CW-900EZ), please contact :

					PR157 - Powerful Industrial Ion Gun

 

 

 





		Friday, 29 June 2012 10:15	






	As the Exclusive North American Distributor for VESSEL Company in Japan, JDV Products Inc. is proud to introduce VESSEL’s New Powerful Industrial Ion Gun with LED Light Beam (Model# BBZ-E).
	 

	 

	The rugged industrial ion gun is designed to neutralize and eliminate dust while effectively cleaning the surface on large plastic-made products while working in an upright position.
	 

	 

	The BBZ-E provides a very accurate ion balance (within +/-10V) at a higher air pressure (58-87psi), which results in effective cleaning for blowing contaminants off a large surface area.  Using a powerful airflow at 87psi, it can rapidly neutralize an area at a 12” distance in less than 0.7 seconds (or 6” distance in less than 0.5 seconds)!
	 

	 

	Unlike other models, the BBZ-E is outfitted with an integrated LED light beam for visual dust confirmation and does not have an external transformer.  Instead, it’s composed of a safe high-frequency piezoelectric transformer that’s built into the handle.  This compact design saves valuable workspace and makes it easier to move from one location to another.
	 

	 

	The nozzle angle is ergonomically crafted to help alleviate any burden on the operator’s wrist while pointing to the targeted area for dust removal.  It has a non-slip grip (even for clean room gloves), is very compact, and ultra lightweight (only 0.44 lbs). Both sides of the grip have a “green” operating LED and a “red” high-voltage LED, which enables both left and right-handed users to check the operational state at a glance.
	 

	 

	Also, the unique Silent Straight Nozzle is very quiet (only 77.3 dBA at 43.5psi) and helps reduce “wind-roar” noise levels in factories.  The low noise characteristics have almost no effect on other electronic devices.
	 

	 

	The “screw-type” nozzle construction allows for easy maintenance.  The Tungsten electrode needle (#G-7H) can quickly be cleaned or replaced by using the optional removal tool (#G-7DR).  Various attachments are available for better work efficiency such as brushes, an air tube adapter, and a “silent” or flared-shape nozzle.
	 

	 

	Other features include a durable 16.4’ power cable for working in a large area, a vibration-resistant screw-in connector between the power cable and the body for improved durability, a safe low voltage 24V DC power supply, holds the CE marking, and complies with RoHS standards.

					PR160 -  "Butterfly Louver" Slim Fan-Type Ionizer

 

 

 





		Friday, 05 October 2012 10:17	






Conventional fan-type ionizers are used in many industries for several different types of applications.  For instance, electronic part manufacturing and assembly plants use fan-type ionizers for preventing electronic components from being damaged caused by electrostatic discharge (ESD).  In this situation, a fan-type ionizer is placed on the workbench for static removal over a wide range at a close distance.  Also, since “space” is limited on a workbench, using compact designed equipment is preferred.

Moreover, resin forming factories and printing plants use fan-type ionizers for preventing dust adherence on the surface of parts that is caused by static electricity.  An ionizer is installed into the system for static erasing from a remote location, which may require neutralizing the air in a straight pattern so that it reaches a further distance.

In either case, the area coverage that is needed for static erasing is different.

As a solution, JDV Products Inc. is proud to announce the release of VESSEL’s New “Butterfly Louver” Ultra-Slim Fan-Type Ionizer (Model# F120-E).
	Unlike most conventional fan-type ionizers, the F120-E has a unique adjustable front panel that can disperse the airflow in a “wide” or a “straight” pattern for a close or remote distance.  This versatile design is suitable for a wide range of static removal applications such as for a bag making machine, a high-speed automated line for substrate manufacturing, for liquid crystal film cutting equipment, over a forming machine conveyor, for a soldering or film attachment, and in electronic device component stock area.

	The F120-E has a very fast decay time within 1.3 seconds at a 12” distance (straight louver/ max airflow setting).  It’s equipped with an AC corona discharge method for an accurate ion balance within +/-10V, a reliable high-frequency piezoelectric transformer for minimizing ion loss, and is outfitted with an adjustable three-speed fan which is powerful and capable of blowing ionized air to remote locations.

	In addition, it’s crafted with a super slim and compact body (7.8”H x 6.4”W x 2.7”D with stand) and is very lightweight (only 1.98 lbs) so it saves valuable workbench space and makes it convenient for easy installation.

	On the front of the unit, there is a clear operator LED display panel.  A  “green” LED indicates good operating condition and a “red” LED represents a high-voltage or a fan lock-up warning.  Also, since there is a unique built-in terminal connector, the high voltage warning signals can be sent to external equipment and it enables up to two units to be daisy-chained together using one power source.

	Easy access to the internal components simplifies maintenance. The front cover can be quickly removed and there is a safety device that shuts off the circuit and fan when the front cover is open.  There are no tools required for removing the stainless steel electrode needle discharge unit.  It’s installed into the front panel so its easily accessible for removing or cleaning it.

	Other features include a safe low voltage 24V DC power supply, a swivel stand that can be bench or wall-mounted, the CE marking, and it is RoHS compliant.
