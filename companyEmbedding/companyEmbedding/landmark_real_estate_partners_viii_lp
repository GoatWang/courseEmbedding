Private Equity
A Principal Focus on Secondary Investments
Landmark  acquires limited partnership interests and direct investments in real asset, venture, mezzanine, and buyout assets. Landmark has acquired private  equity interests from domestic and international sellers in funds worldwide since 1990.

As a pioneer of the secondary market for private equity assets, Landmark has brought fifteen funds to market and the secondary market   has grown over the last two decades in proportion to the private equity market as a whole and as  the need for liquidity among owners of private equity assets has evolved.

For investors, secondary funds offer the following potential benefits:

Enhanced diversification
Smoothing the "J-Curve"
Identified Assets
Return segmentation
Extensive due diligence

Points to Consider

        Landmark employs a proprietary due  diligence process  in making its investment  decisions and has been successfully employing this process for over a decade.

        Landmark has the capital, experience, and legal resources to close complex  secondary interest transactions in a timely manner. 

        Landmark has acquired a variety of non-U.S. interests, including companies  or limited partnership interests in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and  the Pacific Rim.  Landmark has the contacts and expertise to acquire  attractive interests on a global basis. 

        Landmark’s long associations with institutional investors and private equity  fund sponsors enable it to acquire many transactions through private  negotiation, avoiding highly competitive public auctions.

        For more information contact the private equity  secondaries team.
