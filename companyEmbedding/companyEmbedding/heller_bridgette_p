WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) today announced the appointment of 
      Bridgette P. Heller as Executive Vice President and President, Consumer 
      Health Care. Ms. Heller will succeed Stanley F. Barshay, who had 
      postponed his planned retirement to serve in a transition role following 
      the merger of Merck and Schering-Plough. Effective March 1, 2010, Ms. 
      Heller, 48, will report directly to Richard T. Clark, Merck’s chairman, 
      president and chief executive officer, and will serve on the company’s 
      Executive Committee.
    


      As leader of Consumer Health Care, Ms. Heller will leverage Merck’s 
      consumer products brands to capitalize on new growth opportunities, 
      including expanding the consumer business in markets outside the United 
      States. Merck’s Consumer Health Care division is home to a variety of 
      household names, including, among others, AFRIN, CLARITIN, COPPERTONE, 
      DR. SCHOLL'S, MiraLAX and LOTRIMIN. Each day, millions of people count 
      on one or more of Merck’s industry-leading brands that help prevent or 
      treat various common conditions.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to welcome Bridgette as the leader of our 
      Consumer Health Care division,” said Mr. Clark. “While the Consumer 
      Health Care business already has an established presence around the 
      world, it also represents an attractive growth opportunity for Merck. 
      Bridgette has an impressive track record of leading multi-billion dollar 
      businesses, as well as exceptional marketing acumen, both of which will 
      serve her well in leading growth initiatives for Merck’s consumer 
      business.”
    

      “This is an exciting time to join the new Merck, with its focus on the 
      consumer health care sector,” said Ms. Heller. “I look forward to 
      working with the talented team throughout this division to pursue growth 
      through enhanced innovation, creative research and development and 
      improved products in our Consumer Health Care business.”
    

      Ms. Heller most recently served as President of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby 
      Global Business Unit since 2007 and prior to that she was Johnson & 
      Johnson’s Global President, Baby, Kids and Wound Care. While at Johnson 
      & Johnson, Ms. Heller led a global team across all functions of the 
      business unit with worldwide revenues of over $2.5 billion.
    

      Before joining Johnson & Johnson Ms. Heller was founder and managing 
      partner at Heller Associates from 2004-2005, where she provided 
      consumer-centric growth strategies for companies outside of the 
      traditional consumer packaged goods arena. Previously, Ms. Heller 
      provided hands-on leadership as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of 
      the Board of Chung’s Gourmet Foods, the second largest U.S. egg roll 
      manufacturer. And before that Ms. Heller served as Executive Vice 
      President and General Manager, Coffee Division at Kraft Foods, Inc. 
      where she had full P&L responsibility for the largest coffee portfolio 
      in the U.S. with $1.5 billion in revenues. In this capacity, Ms. Heller 
      operated across multiple sales channels, including grocery, specialty 
      retailers and direct-to-consumer and directed an internal organization 
      of 500 employees across four manufacturing facilities, and an additional 
      550 employees from three outsourcing partners. Prior to that, Ms. Keller 
      held a variety of managerial roles at Kraft since 1985.
    

      Ms. Heller received an MBA from the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of 
      Management at Northwestern University and received her B.A. from 
      Northwestern University.

Forward Looking Statement


      This news release includes “forward-looking statements” within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, 
      but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger 
      between Merck and Schering-Plough, including future financial and 
      operating results, the combined company’s plans, objectives, 
      expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical 
      facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and 
      expectations of Merck’s management and are subject to significant risks 
      and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the 
      forward-looking statements.
    

      The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to 
      differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the 
      possibility that the expected synergies from the merger of Merck and 
      Schering-Plough will not be realized, or will not be realized within the 
      expected time period, due to, among other things, the impact of 
      pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending legislation that could 
      affect the pharmaceutical industry; the risk that the businesses will 
      not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger making it 
      more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; 
      Merck’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; 
      dependence on the effectiveness of Merck’s patents and other protections 
      for innovative products; the risk of new and changing regulation and 
      health policies in the U.S. and internationally and the exposure to 
      litigation and/or regulatory actions.
    

      Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
      statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ 
      materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be 
      found in Merck’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Schering-Plough’s 
      Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 
      30, 2009, the proxy statement filed by Merck on June 25, 2009 and each 
      company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (SEC) available at the SEC’s Internet site: www.sec.gov.

Business Wire




Feb 15, 2010 4:33 PM EST













 


















































  Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) today announced the appointment of Bridgette P. Heller as Executive Vice President and President, Consumer Health Care. Ms. Heller will succeed Stanley F. Barshay, who had postponed his planned retirement to serve in a transition role following the merger of Merck and Schering-Plough. Effective March 1, 2010, Ms. Heller, 48, will report directly to Richard T. Clark, Merck’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, and will serve on the company’s Executive Committee.  As leader of Consumer Health Care, Ms. Heller will leverage Merck’s consumer products brands to capitalize on new growth opportunities, including expanding the consumer business in markets outside the United States. Merck’s Consumer Health Care division is home to a variety of household names, including, among others, AFRIN, CLARITIN, COPPERTONE, DR. SCHOLL'S, MiraLAX and LOTRIMIN. Each day, millions of people count on one or more of Merck’s industry-leading brands that help prevent or treat various common conditions.  “We are extremely pleased to welcome Bridgette as the leader of our Consumer Health Care division,” said Mr. Clark. “While the Consumer Health Care business already has an established presence around the world, it also represents an attractive growth opportunity for Merck. Bridgette has an impressive track record of leading multi-billion dollar businesses, as well as exceptional marketing acumen, both of which will serve her well in leading growth initiatives for Merck’s consumer business.”  “This is an exciting time to join the new Merck, with its focus on the consumer health care sector,” said Ms. Heller. “I look forward to working with the talented team throughout this division to pursue growth through enhanced innovation, creative research and development and improved products in our Consumer Health Care business.”  Ms. Heller most recently served as President of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Global Business Unit since 2007 and prior to that she was Johnson & Johnson’s Global President, Baby, Kids and Wound Care. While at Johnson & Johnson, Ms. Heller led a global team across all functions of the business unit with worldwide revenues of over $2.5 billion.

2013 Woman of the Year



Bridgette P. Heller, executive vice president and president of Merck Consumer Care, named 2013 Woman Of The Year by the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association
The Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (HBA) announced that its 2013 Woman of the Year is Bridgette P. Heller, executive vice president at Merck and president of Merck Consumer Care.
"I am extremely honored to be chosen as Woman of the Year by the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association,” said Ms. Heller. “I greatly admire the organization and the daily contribution its members make in advancing the positive impact of women leaders in our industry. For a great majority of households around the globe, women effectively serve as chief medical officers, so as an industry we must commit to ensuring that these women have the products and services needed to care for the health of their families. I believe women leaders are particularly in tune with the needs of families and are critical players in the industry's quest to better serve them."
Ms. Heller will be honored at the HBA’s 24th annual Woman of the Year event on Thursday, May 9, at the Hilton New York. This is the event of the year for the healthcare community, attended by nearly 2,500 leaders in the industry. Awards for Honorable Mentor, STAR, and a group of over 100 Rising Stars notable for their accomplishments and contributions to the healthcare industry will also be presented at the event.
“The Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association is extremely proud to honor Bridgette P. Heller as our 2013 Woman of the Year,” says Terri Pascarelli, president of the HBA and managing director of life sciences at YourEncore Inc. “Bridgette's leadership in healthcare, and business success inspire all of us to reach further in our own careers.”
“We at Merck applaud and thank HBA for recognizing Bridgette Heller with this prestigious honor,” said Ken Frazier, chairman, president and CEO of Merck. “Bridgette is an inspiring leader who motivates others with her passion and conviction about understanding and meeting the needs of consumers. She has a strong track record leading mature businesses, driving entrepreneurial ventures and supporting diversity, including opportunities for women. Bridgette's values, actions and leadership make her a great representative of HBA and the industry.”
Before joining Merck in 2010, Ms. Heller was president of Johnson & Johnson's Baby Global Business Unit, and earlier was global president of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby, Kids and Wound Care business unit from 2005-2007. Prior to joining Johnson & Johnson, Bridgette was the founder and managing partner of Heller Associates, providing consumer-centric growth strategies for companies outside of the traditional consumer packaged goods arena. Earlier in her career, Bridgette was CEO of Chung's Gourmet Foods, where she provided hands-on leadership for the second-largest US egg roll manufacturer. Ms. Heller was also with Kraft Foods Inc., for 17 years, where her most recent position was as executive vice president and general manager of the coffee division, which constituted the largest coffee portfolio in the US.
Ms. Heller serves on the board of directors for The ADT Corporation and has an extensive record of not-for-profit service. She is currently a member of the national board of directors for Girl's Incorporated, having previously served as board chair; a member of the executive leadership council and a former member of the advisory board for the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University. She has been recognized by several organizations, including Advertising Age, Essence and Black Enterprise, for her overall leadership and innovation in marketing.
Ms. Heller earned an MBA from the JL Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University and a BA from Northwestern University.
