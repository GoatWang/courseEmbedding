 LEGAL NOTICES

 Information displayed on this Grosvenor Europe Website may contain material that is interpreted as a financial promotion for purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (the “FSMA”).  Grosvenor Europe is not an authorised person for purposes of the FSMA, and accordingly, the communication of information on this Grosvenor Europe Website is provided only for and is directed only at persons in the UK reasonably believed to be of a kind to whom such promotions may be communicated by an unauthorised person pursuant to an exemption under the FSMA (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “FPO”).  Such persons include: (a) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments (“Investment Professionals”) and (b) high net worth bodies corporate, partnerships, unincorporated associations, trusts, etc. falling within Article 49 of the FPO (“High Net Worth Businesses”).

 If you are not resident in an EEA member state or you are viewing this Grosvenor Europe Website in a country that is not an EEA member state, information displayed on this Grosvenor Europe Website contains material that may be interpreted by the relevant authorities in the country from which you are viewing the Grosvenor Europe Website as a financial promotion or an offer to purchase securities.
