Better than print advertisement, or word of mouth, 
as it turns those marketing dollars into an actual, physical product.   With the selection of promotional products 
at Brilliant Promos™, we have the items your business needs and we can put the logo on for you!   The first known use of 
promotional products can be dated back to the days of George Washington with the use of commemorative buttons.  
In the 1800's, there were promotional products used such as calendars, rulers, and other wooden promotional products.  
However, the organization of the promotional products industry can be dated to the late 1800's.
Nearly any item in today's business can be turned into a promotional product.  Why buy a standard item when you 
can have them imprinted with your company logo?  The staff at Brilliant Promos™ can assist with your order, whether 
it is for around-the-office promotional products such as 
pens, 
memo pads, 
or business card holders, 
or can provide you with trade show promotions such as lanyards, badge holders, giveaways, and so much more!   If you have an event, 
we surely have the promotional product for you!
Why choose Brilliant Promos™?At Brilliant Promos™, our staff has the singular purpose of making sure our customers are 100% satisfied with, 
not only their experience with shopping for their logo imprinted items, but with the customer service while sourcing 
their promotional products.  Some other companies have random sales persons handling your order.   Our account managers 
will not only help you find the promotional products for you, but will be with you during the entire process, well 
beyond the moment you receive your logo imprinted products.  If there is anything that can make your promotional products
 shopping experience better, we are happy to respond quickly to your suggestions.  Our web development staff is in-house,
  not an outsourced entity that can only do sporadic updates.  If there is something that makes it easier for you to 
  get your logo imprinted on the promotional item you want, the change will be started immediately.
When you choose Brilliant Promos™, you are getting our guarantee that we will get you the custom logo imprinted 
item you want, when you want it, and the best price.  Our guarantee goes well beyond the price 
of your promotional products.  If you have any trouble deciding on which item you want your logo imprinted upon, your 
account manager can find creative and unique ways to maximize your marketing dollars with promotional products.   
While we have many thousands of items on our website, we have access to hundreds of thousands more promotional products 
you might have never realized were available.  This is part of our ongoing promise to provide you with the only source 
you need for promoting your business.  We can help you through the idea stage when deciding on your next promotion.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
