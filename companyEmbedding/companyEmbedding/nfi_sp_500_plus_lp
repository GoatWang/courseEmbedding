  SAN FRANCISCO, July 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  HOVER, the platform that transforms smartphone photos of a home into a fully measured, customizable 3D model, today announced a partnership with LP Building Products for its LP® SmartSide® Trim & Siding line of treated engineered wood products. The two industry-leading companies are teaming up to make the LP SmartSide product line available within the HOVER platform. Thousands of exterior contractors are already using HOVER to receive an interactive 3D model and detailed exterior measurements of a home, which allows them to save a tremendous amount of time on measuring, creating an estimate and closing new business. Thanks to the partnership, contractors who work with LP SmartSide products can now use HOVER's design features to show homeowners within seconds what LP SmartSide materials and colors will look like on their home.  "Our partnership with HOVER will make it easier than ever for re-side contractors to grow their businesses with LP SmartSide Trim & Siding products," said LP's Segment Marketing Manager, Rick Marsh. "By showing homeowners what their home could look like with different LP SmartSide materials and in popular colors available from our preferred prefinishers, they can allow the homeowner to confidently decide on the look of their home." "Every day we see HOVER helping our customers shorten the sales cycle and increase their close rates by visualizing different options on the 3D model of a customer's home," adds HOVER CEO and founder A.J. Altman. "We'll also provide these contractors with all exterior measurements needed to quote an LP SmartSide installation and order the right amount of material, which we've seen resulting in greater efficiency and cost savings for our customers." Exterior contractors can now gain access to the HOVER platform and visualize LP SmartSide products and colors by downloading HOVER from the App Store or Google Play. They get 30 days to try out the platform and $125 in credit to get started.  About HOVER  HOVER transforms smartphone photos of any home into a fully measured, customizable 3D model.
