ABOUT US
Otter Creek Advisors is a boutique investment firm that is focused on fundamentally based, value-oriented investing. The Firm was founded in 2014 and is 100% employee-owned. We currently manage a single strategy through a liquid alternative fund – the Otter Creek Long/Short Opportunity Fund (OTTRX/OTCRX).
Otter Creek has an overriding fundamental belief that the best way to compound wealth over time is to avoid significant drawdowns of capital. As long/short investors, our investment process attempts to create an original, yet opportunistic portfolio, employing a deep-dive fundamental approach to security analysis with a strong focus on risk management.
Each of the principals of Otter Creek Advisors has invested a significant percentage of their personal net worth in the fund, as we believe it is paramount to have our interests aligned with those of our investors.
Our goal, over time, is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns while protecting capital in volatile markets. We hope to not only achieve our investment goal, but also establish a long-lasting partnership with our investors.

PHILOSOPHY
Independent Thinking
We are independent thinkers who focus on creating an original and opportunistic portfolio driven by our own fundamental analysis. Put simply, we do not rely heavily on Wall Street generated investment research. We have found that our location in South Florida, away from major financial centers, has been instrumental in avoiding the typical group think and herd mentality.
Focus
We believe in managing a relatively concentrated portfolio that is focused on our best ideas. Comprehensive fundamental analysis is what gives us conviction in managing a more concentrated portfolio relative to the majority of our peers.
Investing With You
We have a vested interest in the fund's success. Investing a significant component of our personal savings creates the proper alignment between fund management and investor interests.
Team Approach
Team collaboration is fundamental to our firm. We believe that it is important to have the entire team discuss investments collectively to reach a consensus opinion rather than being reliant on one individual. In our view, everyone achieves more by working together.

RISK MANAGEMENT
We identify risk by managing overall portfolio exposure and individual position size.


Position Level Risk Management

Invest in securities with a margin of safety
Assess liquidity risk in individual names
Monitor currency risk, economic risk, and country risk
A security that has a short interest greater than 20% will not be more than 1% of the fund
Any short position that moves against the portfolio by 25% in under six months is reduced by half if not completely eliminated



Portfolio Level Risk Management

Historically have used little or no leverage
Measure portfolio volatility as expressed by Value at Risk as well as its standard deviation and compare it to the S&P 500 index volatility
Within sectors, we manage exposure by limiting overall sector size and reviewing developments on a daily basis
Do not employ hedging strategies, however The Firm actively shorts individual securities in seeking profits and will use puts in conjunction with short equity to complement a short position when deemed appropriate

What are analysts saying about Cree stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Cree stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Cree, Inc. is a market-leading innovator and manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products by significantly increasing their energy performance and efficiency. Key to Cree's market advantage is its world-class materials expertise in silicon carbide and gallium nitride for chips and packaged devices that can handle more power in a smaller space while producing less heat than other available technologies, materials and products. Cree drives its increased performance technology into multiple applications, including exciting alternatives in brighter and more-tunable light for general illumination, backlighting for more-vivid displays, optimized power management for high-current switch-mode power supplies and variable-speed motors, and more-effective wireless infrastructure for data and voice communications. Cree customers range from innovative lighting-fixtures makers to defense-related federal agencies.   " (7/18/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "We are actually incrementally more positive on CREE after termination of the Wolfspeed divestiture to Infineon [Not Rated] due to regulatory concerns. While management's strategy is to transform Cree from a device manufacturer to becoming a lighting company, we have been concerned about the unintended consequence of the deal. Since selling Wolfspeed would offload a large profit contributor, we believe CREE could be hastened to quickly redeploy that capital in acquisitions, ultimately leading to buying a "wrong" asset. We like the decision to keep Wolfspeed especially as it appears the business is entering a new growth phase and contributing solid profits to the overall company. With the model in flux and the loss of a cash for downside support for the stock, we maintain our Hold." (2/17/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, "Cree's had in line results excluding the $0.13 EPS benefit from its legal settlement with Feit. We keep a Sell rating as it is at the high end of its historical range at 50x its FY18E EPS of $0.54 despite sales trends just starting to stabilize. We believe the stock could trade higher in the near term as its main peer Acuity Brands missed guidance and Cree hit its guidance. We estimate the settlement from FEIT in the quarter was $27M and negative reserve effects for a defective driver in its lighting products were $8M. Lighting sales and margins were in line with expectations when excluding these impacts. Cree reported strong quoting activity and its Mar-17 lighting sales were guided better than the normal -5% q/q seasonality. Cree expects this to more positively impact sales in late FY2017 and into FY2018 given the 9-12 month conversion cycle." (1/25/2017)
4. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "Cree's pivot towards being an LED lighting pure-play will take time, as the core commercial lighting business stays more muted and (recent) encouraging signs in LED component pricing (and potential micro LED capacity absorption in the industry) are too early to suggest a sustainable trend toward margin expansion, in our view. Pivots take time, and the Street should be looking toward ~F2018 as a time frame to measure related progress, in our view." (1/19/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 9 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.08)Consensus Price Target: $24.71 (6.77% downside)
