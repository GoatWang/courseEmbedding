Azarga Uranium is aiming to be America’s next uranium developer. Our initial development priority, the Dewey Burdock Project, received its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license in April 2014 and its draft Class III and Class V Underground Injection Control permits from the Environmental Protection Agency in March 2017. The Company is in the process of completing other regulatory permit approvals necessary for development of the high-grade in-situ recovery project. The Company also owns the Centennial Project in Colorado, the Aladdin Deposit in Wyoming, two uranium exploration properties in Wyoming and 70% of the Kyzyl Ompul Project in the Kyrgyz Republic.

GREENWOOD VILLAGE, COLO.-- Azarga Uranium Corporation has announced that it intends to issue 5.8 million units of stock at a price of 26 cents per unit to raise $1.5 million through a non-brokered private placement.
Azarga intends to use the proceeds of this "financing" to continue to advance the Dewey Burdock in-situ recovery uranium project towards construction, to identify additional uranium resources at Dewey Burdock through the analysis of historical data and for general working capital purposes.
Each unit consists of one common share of the company and one-half of one share purchase warrant.
One warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the company at a price of 36 cents per share for a period of three years from the closing of the financing.
The shares issued in connection with the financing will be subject to a four-month and a day hold period. In addition, the financing is subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Finder's fees will be payable on a portion of the financing.
Certain insiders of the company are expected to purchase units pursuant to the financing.
The Company is exempt from the requirements to obtain a formal valuation or minority shareholder approval in connection with the financing in, since neither the fair market value of the securities received by such parties nor the proceeds for such securities exceeds 25 percent of the company's market capitalization.
The company says the Dewey Burdock in-situ recovery uranium project, which is its "initial development priority," has received its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license and draft Class III and Class V Underground Injection Control permits from the Environmental Protection Agency and is in the process of completing other major regulatory permit approvals necessary for the construction of the project, including the final Class III and Class V UIC permits from the EPA.

GREENWOOD VILLAGE, COLO.-- Azarga Uranium Corporation has announced that it intends to issue 5.8 million units of stock at a price of 26 cents per unit to raise $1.5 million through a non-brokered private placement.
Azarga intends to use the proceeds of this "financing" to continue to advance the Dewey Burdock in-situ recovery uranium project towards construction, to identify additional uranium resources at Dewey Burdock through the analysis of historical data and for general working capital purposes.
Each unit consists of one common share of the company and one-half of one share purchase warrant.
One warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the company at a price of 36 cents per share for a period of three years from the closing of the financing.
The shares issued in connection with the financing will be subject to a four-month and a day hold period. In addition, the financing is subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Finder's fees will be payable on a portion of the financing.
Certain insiders of the company are expected to purchase units pursuant to the financing.
The Company is exempt from the requirements to obtain a formal valuation or minority shareholder approval in connection with the financing in, since neither the fair market value of the securities received by such parties nor the proceeds for such securities exceeds 25 percent of the company's market capitalization.
The company says the Dewey Burdock in-situ recovery uranium project, which is its "initial development priority," has received its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license and draft Class III and Class V Underground Injection Control permits from the Environmental Protection Agency and is in the process of completing other major regulatory permit approvals necessary for the construction of the project, including the final Class III and Class V UIC permits from the EPA.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Azarga Uranium Corp (TSE:PWE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
