Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown here. The Williams Capital Shares are offered exclusively to clients of The Williams Capital Group, L.P. Williams Capital Group, L.P., is not affiliated with Northern Funds Distributors, LLC or Northern Trust. Northern Trust Investments, Inc. has contractually agreed to reimburse a portion of the operating expenses of the Portfolio to the extent the Portfolio's "Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses" exceed a percentage limit. This contractual limitation, for each of the funds listed, may not be terminated without the approval of the Board of Trustees before April 1, 2018. In the absence of these reimbursements, yield, total return, growth since inception and dividends would have been reduced. Total return is based on net change in NAV assuming reinvestment of distributions. The 7-day current yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Portfolio than the total returns. The Portfolio also includes voluntary expense reimbursements to prevent a negative yield that may change or end at any time.

*Total Return performance represents cumulative total return for the period 08/01/16 through 06/30/17.





Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown here.


Northern Trust Investments, Inc. has contractually agreed to reimburse a portion of the operating expenses of the Portfolio (other than certain excepted expenses, i.e., acquired fund fees and expenses, service fees, the compensation paid to each Independent Trustee of the Trust, expenses of third party consultants engaged by the Board of Trustees, membership dues paid to the Investment Company Institute and Mutual Fund Directors Forum, expenses in connection with the negotiation and renewal of the revolving credit facility, extraordinary expenses and interest) to the extent the "Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses" exceed 0.15% for Shares and 0.20% for Premier Shares. For Premier Shares, the "Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses After Expense Reimbursement" may be higher than the contractual limitation as a result of certain Portfolio expenses, including but not limited to service fees, that are not reimbursed. This contractual limitation may not be terminated before April 1, 2018 without the approval of the Board of Trustees. In the absence of these reimbursements, yield, total return, growth since inception and dividends would have been reduced. Total return is based on net change in NAV assuming reinvestment of distributions. The 7-day current yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Portfolio than the total returns. The Portfolio also includes voluntary expense reimbursements to prevent a negative yield that may change or end at any time. Without the voluntary expense reimbursements, the 7-day current yield would have been 0.86% for Shares and 0.81% for Premier Shares as of June 30, 2017. In the event the 7-day current yield with waivers and the 7-day current yield without waivers are equal, it would indicate there were no voluntary waivers necessary for the preceding 7-day period.


NAV Information: Market Value NAV is calculated using current market quotations, or an appropriate substitute, to value a portfolio. This NAV is not currently being used for transacting purchase and sale activity. All purchase and sale activity is being transacted at the Amortized Cost NAV of $1.00.

U.S. Government Guarantee: U.S. government guarantees apply only to the underlying securities of a Fund’s portfolio and not the Fund’s shares.





iMoneyNet Fund AverageTM - Treasury & Repo Institutional category includes only institutional government funds that hold U.S. Treasuries and repurchase agreements backed by the U.S. Treasury. The category average is the average of all funds in this category reported by iMoneyNet. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.





Quality Distribution: A security is classified as Tier 1 when two or more of the three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have assigned a rating in their top short-term ratings category (A1+ and A1 for Standard & Poor's, P1 for Moody's and F1+ and F1 for Fitch). A security is classified as Tier 2 when two or more of the ratings assigned to that security are below the top short-term ratings from the agencies (this would include ratings of A2 for Standard & Poor's, P2 for Moody's and F2 for Fitch). If a security has only two short-term ratings available, the lower rating is used to define the Tier; i.e. a split rating of A1/P2 is considered Tier 2. If only one short-term rating is available for a security, the Tier is determined by that one agency. A security is classified as Tier 3 if it does not meet the definition of Tier 1 or Tier 2, has two or more ratings below A2, P2, or F2 or if the security does not have a short-term rating.





Distribution Calculations: (Security Distribution, Quality Distribution, Maturity Distribution and Sector Distribution) are measured on a trade date basis and exclude uninvested cash from the market value used to compute the percentage calculations.





Maturity Distribution: The data is measured using the lower of the stated maturity date or next interest rate reset date.

Municipal Portfolio

as of 6/30/17

Fund Commentary

During the second quarter, fixed-income markets attempted to reconcile conflicting signals from economic indicators, proposed legislation and global central banks. Investors had hoped to see progress toward reform of healthcare and ultimately taxes, only to be disappointed by quarter end. While legislative initiatives fell flat, progress was made in the jobs market. Steady job growth pushed the unemployment rate to the cycle low of 4.3%, giving the Federal Reserve cover to increase its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points (0.25%) following the June meeting.
In the short-duration municipal market, demand for tax-exempt investments remained strong. The second quarter of each year marks the beginning of the municipal note season, during which municipalities offer fixed-rate one-year notes in anticipation of future tax and revenue receipts. Offerings of these anticipation notes were well received as bond and money market funds looked for high quality tax-exempt investments. The strong demand for these notes flattened the one-year tax-exempt yield curve for much of the quarter. By quarter end, weekly municipal variable rate demand notes, or VRDNs, traded at approximately the same yield as one-year fixed-rate notes.
The Portfolio returned 0.16% in the second quarter. Cash balances were invested primarily in daily and weekly VRDNs. Attractive tax-exempt yields and the ability to tender at par made municipal VRDNs a preferred choice throughout the quarter. In an effort to minimize net asset value variance and maximize liquidity, the Portfolio’s weighted average maturity was maintained at approximately five days or less throughout the quarter.

Among the thousands of mutual funds available today, few are backed by a company with more than 125 years of leadership. Managed by Northern Trust, Northern Institutional Funds provides investors with access to proven investment management that dates back to 1889.
Strategy
Northern Trust's investment business strategy has focused on expansion through a “build, buy, and partner” approach. Major acquisitions, new product launches, strategic business alliances, and an increased commitment to sales and servicing have contributed to Northern Trust's outstanding growth and increased market share and a greater breadth, depth, and expertise in the Northern Institutional Funds’ product and servicing offering.
Investment Belief
Our investment management approach is founded on a core set of beliefs, beginning with the premise that inefficiencies exist in the financial markets, but vary over time, by asset class and across market sectors. When those inefficiencies are absent, passive strategies offer the best risk/reward profile.
We believe that risk is a controllable and necessary component of active management. And we believe there is an intrinsic relationship between investment risk and return, which can be estimated, analyzed, and managed.
Client Commitment
Client service is a hallmark of Northern Trust. Whether your needs involve pensions, portfolio management, or financial consulting, you will receive impeccable service from experts who understand your unique challenges. Our focus is clear – to offer you compelling investment and risk management choices, with an in-depth understanding of your unique needs and goals.
We look forward to the opportunity to assist you with your institutional investment needs. If you would like to discuss your program, or have any questions about our services, please contact us.
