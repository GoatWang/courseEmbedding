The Invesco Exchange Fund No Load Has Reached The Summit - Invesco Exchange Fund No Load (MUTF:ACEHX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Invesco Exchange Fund No Load Has Reached The SummitJun.24.16 | About: Invesco Exchange (ACEHX) Andre Waldron Tech, 3D printing, robotics, fund holdingsMarket EyewitnessSummaryThe Invesco Exchange Fund No Load is the top-performing fund in the Large Blend Category with a YTD Return of 12.03%.The fund's performance has been boosted by its portfolio weight advantages in the energy and basic materials sectors. Additionally, the fund has been given a boost by the poor-performing health-care.The fund' has a very affordable expense ratio in comparison to its benchmarks.The Invesco Exchange Fund No Load (MUTF:ACEHX) is the #1 rated fund in the Large Blend Category. The fund has an YTD Return of 12.03%. This is compared to the S&P 500's YTD Return of 4.52% as well as the Large Blend Category average's YTD Return of 3.13%. Also, this is a significant turnaround from the fund's performances in recent years. Other than a minor outperformance of the Large Blend Category in 2011, the fund has been outpaced by their benchmarks in every other year annually. 

 In the fund's market capitalization statistics, the fund has a significant advantage of over 10% in terms of mid-cap stock weightings. Additionally, the fund has portfolio weight deficits in the giant-cap portfolio weighting vs. its benchmarks. The fund's market capitalization statistics can be seen below.   Size % of Portfolio Benchmark Category Avg.   Giant 43.36 44.88 67.65   Large 22.06 33.07 12.04   Medium 32.82 19.78 17.36   Small 0.79 2.22 2.82   Micro 0.97 0.05 0.13   The fund's sector weightings provide a greater clue to the fund's outperformance so far this year. As you will see in the chart below, the fund has a portfolio weight advantage of over 20% in the basic materials sector vs its benchmark and the Large Blend Category. Additionally, the Invesco Exchange Fund No Load's concentration in the energy sector is 15% higher than its benchmark and the Large Blend category average.
 The basic materials and energy sectors have been largely successful for the most part. In terms of U.S Sector performance, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) is the second-best performing U.S Sector ETF with a 16.0% YTD Return. The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLB) ranks third in U.S Sector ETF performance with an 11.8% YTD Return. Thus, the fund benefits from overexposure to these solid-performing sectors.   Sector ACEHX Stock % Benchmark Category Avg.   Basic Materials 24.70 3.05 3.10   Energy 23.11 6.84 6.55   The Basic Materials and Energy sectors combine to make up nearly 50% of the fund's weight in holdings. As seen in the charts below, the fund's basic materials and energy sector holdings have boosted the fund's performance so far this year. One of the four basic materials holdings in the fund has a negative YTD Return. Out of the fund's eight energy holdings, only one have a negative YTD Return. As you can see in the charts, the negative holdings in each sector had minimal impact on the fund. The rest of the holdings have performed well.   BASIC MATERIALS SECTOR HOLDING PORTFOLIO WEIGHT YTD RETURN   Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (NYSE:APD) 11.45% 12.89   International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) 9.92% 7.28   Weyerhaeuser Co (NYSE:WY) 2.23% 0.53   Louisiana-Pacific Corp (NYSE:LPX) 0.78% -2.83     ENERGY SECTOR HOLDING PORTFOLIO WEIGHT YTD RETURN   Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) 5.11% 19.67   Hess Corp (NYSE:HES) 4.47% 24.32   Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE:SLB) 4.16% 15.54   Halliburton Co (NYSE:HAL) 3.80% 35.72   Apache Corp (NYSE:APA) 2.25% 31.91   BP PLC (NYSE:BP) 1.79% 14.62   Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 1.18% 2.95   Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) 0.03% -2.83   The fund also have boosted by a strong performance from the fund's health-care sector holdings. The Health Care Select Sect SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLV) has an anemic YTD return of -0.1%. Thus, it would not seem like a good idea on paper for the Invesco Exchange Fund No Load to hold a slight portfolio weight advantage in health-care sector holdings over its benchmarks.
 However, 5 out of the fund's 7 health-care sector holdings have a positive YTD Return. This can be seen below.   HEALTH CARE SECTOR HOLDING PORTFOLIO WEIGHT YTD RETURN   Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 5.15% 15.78   Merck & Co Inc. (NYSE:MRK) 4.60% 10.94   Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) 4.01% 9.01   Express Scripts Holding Co (NASDAQ:ESRX) 1.19% -11.97   Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) 0.72% 21.11   Baxalta Inc. 0.71% 18.09   Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE:CAH) 0.27% -12.06   Finally, the fund benefits from having minimal exposure to the poor-performing financial services sector. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF is the worst-performing U.S Sector ETF with a -1.0% YTD Return. As you can see below, the fund has a very favorable deficit in this poor-performing sector.   Sector ACEHX Stock % Benchmark Category Avg.   Financial Services 0.84% 14.37% 15.16%   In addition to favorable sector weightings, the fund has the benefit of affordability on its side. Right now, the fund's expense ratio is 0.54% as of its latest prospectus. As you can see on the graph, this fund has maintained a competitive advantage in terms of affordability vs. its benchmarks. 

 CONCLUSION This fund is definitely worth the investment for potential investors. The fund has favorable weightings in the energy and basic materials sectors. These favorable weightings have been a major catalyst to this fund's performance so far this year. Additionally, the fund has benefited from an above-average performance from the poor-performing health-care sector. In addition, the fund benefits from having little to no exposure to the poor-performing financial services sector. The fund's advantage in terms of affordability is icing on the cake.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks long-term growth of capital and, secondarily, current income by employing a total return approach, emphasizing capital appreciation, current income and principal preservation. The fund may act as a foundation for investors' portfolios.

			
			
				
			
		



Dividend growers
A high-conviction, actively managed strategy that focuses on dividend-growing companies and seeks to deliver attractive total returns — combining appreciation, income and preservation — over a full market cycle.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Appreciation


A history of adding value
			The fund had a cumulative return of 272% since manager inception versus 257% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.1




Income


A focus on sustainable and growing dividends
			The fund's annualized dividend growth rate was 12.48% since manager inception versus 7.65% for the S&P 500 Index and 5.76% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.2 Please note the dividend growth rate is not a yield or a measure of fund performance but is based on the annualized growth rate of the fund's actual dividend payments. 
		



Preservation


A solid foundation for your equity portfolio
			The fund's Class A shares at NAV outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, by 9.95% in the last major bear market.3



58% of the fund's total return came from reinvested dividends

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund Investor Guide
Investable Ideas: Dividend value investing








 About risk
			 


Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

	SPHD  
		- PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio
	
	

Equity - US Equity




Product Details
The PowerShares S&P 500® High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (Fund) seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index (Index). The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. Standard & Poor's® compiles, maintains and calculates the Index, which is composed of 50 securities traded on the S&P 500 Index that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted semi-annually, in January and July.

			Morningstar Rating™

Overall Rating - Large Value Category








			
			
			
			
			  
			
			
						
			
			
			
			
			
			As of 06/30/2017 the Fund had an overall rating of 5 stars out of 1091 funds and was rated 5 stars out of 1091 funds, N/A stars out of N/A funds and N/A stars out of N/A funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively.
		

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

				Data beginning Fund inception and ending 06/30/2017.  Fund performance shown at NAV.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. The results assume that no cash was added to or assets withdrawn from the Index. Index returns do not represent Fund returns. The Index does not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, nor does the Index lend securities, and no revenues from securities lending were added to the performance shown.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Fund in Focus 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Securities that pay high dividends as a group can fall out of favor with the market, causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay high dividends. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. Standard & Poor's® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("Standard & Poor's") and have been licensed for use by the Adviser. The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor's or its Affiliates, and Standard & Poor's and its Affiliates make no representation, warranty or condition regarding the advisability of buying, selling or holding shares of the Fund. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return through growth of capital and current income.

			
			
				
			
		



Diamonds in the rough
An actively managed strategy that aims to build wealth over time. The fund seeks to outperform by making early and patient investments in large companies whose true value isn't recognized by the market.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Competitive returns


A history of adding value
      Since manager inception, the fund’s Class A shares has delivered higher returns than its benchmark on a cumulative basis, 256% versus 210% and on an annualized basis, 7.49% versus 6.65%.1 



Contrarian approach


A focus on portfolio diversification through contrarian investing
      The team's high-conviction, contrarian approach is designed to uncover undervalued companies during market downturns, setting the fund apart from its benchmark, and providing portfolio diversification aiming to participate in market upswings. 



Added value with our contrarian approach for the 20-year period shown through March 31, 2017
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $56,785, beating its benchmark.





The fund returned 428% over the last 20 years1
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $52,777 beating its benchmark and peers.

For standardized fund performance, visit the fund’s performance page.
Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Visit invesco.com for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end sales charge. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.
 Additional information

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the
same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the
underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to
distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights
with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The
Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than
if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that
the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative
contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require
payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the
derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater
than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund’s
returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments
may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may
be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or
price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during
which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions.
Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to
changing government regulation that could impact the Fund’s ability to use
certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the
expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund’s foreign investments may be
adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or
taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and
the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange
controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign
securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate
fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such
foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure
to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging
strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser’s judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund’s portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative,
regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the
Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund’s investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund’s shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual
stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain
other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the
financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When
markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments
held by the Fund will rise in value.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. Investments in real estate related
instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or
technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of
real estate related to the Fund’s holdings. Shares of real estate related
companies, which tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more
volatile and less liquid.
Sector Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a significant
amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or group of related
industries. In this event, the Fund’s performance will depend to a greater
extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there
is increased risk that the Fund will lose significant value if conditions
adversely affect that sector or group of industries.

Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to
the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity
securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall
stock market.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.
