BLOG: Visteon’s approach to sensor data fusion

To achieve fully autonomous driving – SAE Level
 4/5 – it is essential to make judicious use of 
 sensor data, which is only possible with 
multi-sensor sensor data fusion. Sensor data fusion
 acts as a human brain, providing the car with a                              
   complete  and accurate picture of its surroundings.

Visteon is composed of multiple businesses that design, engineer, and manufacture vehicle cockpit electronics products and connected car solutions[1] for a diversified customer base, including all of the major automakers worldwide.[2] Visteon trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VC.

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

Visteon Corporation (VC) is an American global automotive electronics supplier and Fortune 500 company spun off from the Ford Motor Company in 2000. Visteon is composed of multiple businesses that design, engineer, and manufacture vehicle cockpit electronics products and connected car solutions[1] for a diversified customer base, including all of the major automakers worldwide.[2] Visteon trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VC.

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

Visteon is composed of multiple businesses that design, engineer, and manufacture vehicle cockpit electronics products and connected car solutions[1] for a diversified customer base, including all of the major automakers worldwide.[2] Visteon trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol VC.

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

Visteon's stock jumps to 16-month high after Morgan Stanley upgrade
Shares of Visteon Corp.  rallied 4.5% toward a 16-month high in morning trade Friday, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the auto parts maker. Analyst Adam Jones raised his rating to overweight from equal weight and his stock price target to $115, which is 8.1% above current levels, from $103. Jones said he made "significant changes" to his earnings forecasts in the wake of "much stronger than expected" first-quarter results. "While we are not in a position to extrapolate 1Q performance directly into the immediately subsequent quarters, we have been given enough reason to see or prior forecasts as overly conservative," Jones wrote in a note to clients. The company reported on April 27 first-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations. The stock recently traded at $106.34, the highest level seen since Jan. 13, 2016. It has run up 32% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.8%.

Visteon's stock jumps to 16-month high after Morgan Stanley upgrade
Shares of Visteon Corp.  rallied 4.5% toward a 16-month high in morning trade Friday, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the auto parts maker. Analyst Adam Jones raised his rating to overweight from equal weight and his stock price target to $115, which is 8.1% above current levels, from $103. Jones said he made "significant changes" to his earnings forecasts in the wake of "much stronger than expected" first-quarter results. "While we are not in a position to extrapolate 1Q performance directly into the immediately subsequent quarters, we have been given enough reason to see or prior forecasts as overly conservative," Jones wrote in a note to clients. The company reported on April 27 first-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations. The stock recently traded at $106.34, the highest level seen since Jan. 13, 2016. It has run up 32% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.8%.

BLOG: Visteon’s approach to sensor data fusion
By Anshul Saxena
To achieve fully autonomous driving – SAE Level
 4/5 – it is essential to make judicious use of 
 sensor data, which is only possible with 
multi-sensor sensor data fusion. Sensor data fusion
 acts as a human brain, providing the car with a                              
   complete  and accurate picture of its surroundings.

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

Introduction[edit]
Visteon is to the Ford Motor Company as Delphi is to General Motors and Denso is to Toyota. In 2016, Visteon had sales of US$3.16 billion and 10,000 employees at more than 40 facilities in 19 countries.[3] Since its independence from Ford, Visteon has set a corporate goal of expanding business with other companies, and now has a diversified customer base, working with all of the major automakers worldwide.[4] Visteon's market share, market and revenue has changed substantially since it formed. A majority of revenue (80+%) came from North America, driven by its relationship with Ford Motor Company. Today, its revenue comes predominately from Asia, North America, and Europe. In 2005, Visteon moved to new headquarters in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
Business[edit]
Initially, Visteon participated in three main divisions, namely: climate, electronics, and interior systems. With the sale of its equity interest in the Climate operations in mid-year 2015 and completed sale of its interiors business in 2016, Visteon re-focused on the high-growth cockpit electronics business with a focus on software and the connected car. In 2015, Visteon introduced Sachin Lawande as the new president and CEO to lead the next phase of company growth.
Operations[edit]
The company has three corporate offices reflecting the company's key markets.

North American Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Van Buren Township, Michigan, United States.
Asia Pacific Corporate Office and Innovation Center, Shanghai, China
European Corporate Office, Chelmsford, United Kingdom.[5]

Restructuring[edit]
On September 13, 2005, Visteon and Ford reached an agreement whereby seventeen of the less-profitable Visteon plants and six offices would be transferred to an independent business entity called Automotive Components Holdings LLC. This action, intended to assure the long-term viability of Visteon, involved the transfer of 18,000 hourly workers and 5000 salaried workers to the new entity, reducing Visteon to approximately 52,000 employees worldwide and US$11 billion in annual sales. Three of the plants are in Mexico, the remaining plants and six offices are in the US. Automotive Components Holdings (ACH), managed by Ford, was referred to as a "temporary entity", as its purpose was to prepare the plants and facilities for sale. By the end of 2007, all ACH operations had been closed, scheduled for closure, merged at least partially, or sold (two back to Ford), with transactions to be completed by the end of 2008 except for one plant which is to remain an ACH facility until its closure in 2009.[7]
On March 31, 2009, Visteon's UK subsidiary was deemed insolvent, and placed into administration.[8] The UK subsidiary had never been profitable, and the insolvency was the result of the US parent company being unable to continue to support the British operation. The administrators, KPMG, immediately moved to close all three Visteon UK factories and made 565 workers redundant. Visteon's profitable UK subsidiary Visteon Engineering Services (VES) remained unaffected by the restructuring.
As a result, workers have occupied the plants in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Enfield, London and are picketing the plant in Basildon, Essex, to gain better redundancy packages.[9]
Bankruptcy and Emergence[edit]
The Subprime mortgage crisis greatly impacted the auto industry and left Visteon with little demand. During early March 2009, Visteon was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading at extremely low levels. This action came after Visteon shared dropped from 7 cents, to 2 cents.[10] On May 28, 2009, the company filed voluntary petitions to reorganize Visteon Corporation and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[11] The case was heard in Delaware on May 29, 2009 by Judge Christopher Sontchi [12] where Visteon was granted Chapter 11 protection.
Visteon completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 on October 1, 2010.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In July 2014 Visteon acquired Johnson Controls electronics division for $265 Million.
In July 2016 Visteon acquired AllGo Embedded Systems Pvt Ltd.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
