BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

James D. SHELTON


Obituary
Condolences



















































  SHELTON, James D.James D. Shelton, of Palm Beach Gardens, FL, passed away on August 13, 2013 at the age of 73. Born on June 29, 1940 in High Point, NC, Mr. Shelton was the son of the late Annie Pearl Crutchfield Shelton and Carl Ramsey Shelton. Mr. Shelton grew up in High Point. He received a BA Degree from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina and a Juris Doctorate Degree from the Law School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC. Mr. Shelton practiced law in Columbus, OH, for eleven years before suffering a major heart attack, and moving to Florida to become a Trust Banker. While Mr. Shelton's law career was not a very lengthy one, it was a very successful one, and there was a lot of pride in the number of wins in the Court of Appeals, plus one in the Supreme Court of Ohio. One of Mr. Shelton's highlights was having one of his legal cases made into a movie, "Little Girl Lost", and being portrayed by actor Chris McDonald. Mr. Shelton was a very active and ardent Toastmaster for more than 30 years. He liked to say that he probably had given more competitive Toastmasters International Speeches than anyone else in the history of the organization. At one point or another, Mr. Shelton belonged to six different Toastmasters Clubs in three states, and never missed a chance to speak in every single contest event. Mr. Shelton loved speaking and roasts so much that two years ago he gave himself a eulogy roast so he could hear what his friends had to say about him and he could rebut them. Jim is survived by his devoted and loving wife, Sandra A. Shelton of Palm Beach Gardens; son, Bryan S. Shelton and wife, Jen, and grandchildren, Cassidy and Carter of Columbus, OH; daughter-in-law, Janna Shelton;, grandchildren, Anna Elizabeth Shelton, Wesley Robert Shelton and Luke Edward Shelton of Graham, NC, Crystol Erin Shelton of Copley, OH; stepdaughter, Jennifer Schwartz of Palm Beach Gardens, and stepson, Phillip Schwartz and wife, Chelsea of Fort Myers, FL. Mr. Shelton was preceded in death by sons, Robert Edward Shelton and Eric Douglas Shelton. Mr. Shelton is also survived by a sister, Harriett S. Walker and her husband, Mickey, and their children, Mary Anne Nester (Carl), Rachel Rogers (Patrick), Elizabeth Wentz (Jerry) and Virginia Tweed (Timothy). He is also survived by his very special and loving uncles, Tom and Alfred Crutchfield and an angel of an aunt, Peggy White, and many grand nieces and nephews and cousins. Jim was also blessed with the enjoyment of lifelong friendships with High Point natives and fellow Wolfpackers and special golfing buddies, Michael D. Tomlin, Gary F. Workman, and Peter Daniel Poteat. Jim also enjoyed a long term friendship with mentor, lawyer, and Toastmaster friend, Tom Avrutis of Sarasota. At various times in Palm Beach Gardens, Ft. Myers, Sarasota and Bradenton, Jim served on the Board of Directors for the American Heart, American Lung, Red Cross, and American Cancer Society. A special thank you to Jupiter Medical Center for their great nursing and technical personnel. Also thank you to Hospice of Sarasota. Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, August 16 at 10:00 AM, St. Patrick Catholic Church, 13591 Prosperity Farms Road, Palm Beach Gardens. Private burial will be held in North Carolina. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Mr. Shelton's memory to a Hospice of your choice.To express condolences and/or make donations: Visit PalmBeachPost.com/obituaries
