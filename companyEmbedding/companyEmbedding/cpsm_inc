CPSM, Inc. Closes On Sale Of Building, Reduces Debt 26%






GlobeNewswire



Sep 16, 2016 10:15 AM EDT













 




























































 STUART, Fla., Sept. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CPSM, Inc. (OTCQB:SWMM) the Florida based pool & spa industry aggregator today closed on the sale of its former headquarters property reducing its debt load by over 26%. CPSM, Inc. sold its former headquarters in Palm City, Florida. The proceeds reduced the Company's debt by more than 26% resulting in a Debt to Total Assets ratio of 0.44 to 1. Lawrence Calarco, Chairman of CPSM, Inc. commented, "Growth is vital and to date we have continued at fervent pace. Growth alone however, does not make for a healthy company. We have managed to keep expanding while reducing our debt by a substantial amount. Fiscal restraint and prudent leverage are the hallmarks of a successful, sound and lasting company." CPSM, Inc. is a publicly held company serving the surging pool/spa maintenance, design, and construction industry.
