Forward-Looking Statements



      Certain information in this press release constitutes "forward-looking

      statements." Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact

      that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They

      often include words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates,"

      "estimates," "intends," "plans," "seeks" or words of similar meaning, or

      future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "should," "could," "may,"

      "aims," "intends," or "projects." However, the absence of these words or

      similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not

      forward-looking. These statements may relate to the Company's succession

      planning. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a

      guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future events or

      circumstances may not occur. Management believes that these

      forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However,

      caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such

      forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the

      date when made. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise

      any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,

      future events or otherwise. In addition, forward-looking statements are

      subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual

      results to differ materially from our historical experience and our

      present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties

      include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, "Item 1A.

      Risk Factors" and Part II "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis

      of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our fiscal 2014

      Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, elsewhere in that report and those

      described from time to time in our future reports filed with the

      Securities and Exchange Commission.

Peter G. Leemputte





Keurig Green Mountain has hired Peter G. Leemputte as the company’s new chief financial officer and treasurer.
He will join the company in June 2015 and will assume his roles effective August 17, 2015. Leemputte will succeed current CFO and treasurer, Fran Rathke, who will continue to serve in the role until that date. As previously disclosed, to ensure a smooth transition, Rathke will then become senior advisor to the CEO and will remain with the company through September 2015.
“Pete’s thirty-plus years of financial experience, including more than a dozen years as a public company CFO, will contribute immediately to our efforts,” said Brian Kelley, Keurig president and CEO. “Pete brings significant skills to numerous corporate and leadership initiatives and I am confident that Keurig will benefit from his knowledge and perspective as we continue to grow our hot beverage platforms and move toward the launch of our innovative Keurig Kold beverage system this fall.”
Leemputte brings more than 30 years of experience in corporate finance leadership positions. Most recently he served as CFO of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company from 2008 to March 2015 overseeing a number of functions, including accounting and reporting, financial planning, audit, tax, treasury, investor relations and information technology. Prior to that, he was CFO of Brunswick Corporation from 2003 through 2008. Leemputte has also held numerous leadership roles, including positions at Chicago Title & Trust, Armco, FMC Corporation and Amoco.
