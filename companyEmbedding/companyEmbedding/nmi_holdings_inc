National MI’s Benefits
Our employees are our greatest asset!  Therefore, we offer a comprehensive benefits plan which we are always looking at in order to enhance our offerings.  Below is a list of our current benefit programs.

Health & Wellness
Insurance
Financial/Retirement
Get our attention?


Wellness Program: Our employees’ health is paramount to National MI. A fitness club membership reimbursement of up to $200/year is available to all employees. We also provide access to a wellness portal that includes online personalized coaching, support tools and workshops. Staff at our Emeryville home office enjoy an on-site fitness center. We have a state-of-the art ergonomics program to ensure that all employees are comfortable in their work areas. There is also a fruit delivery program twice a week to make sure there are plenty of fresh and healthy snacks available, free to employees. National MI sponsors athletic events where employees partake in friendly competitions such as a fun run. Proceeds go to a philanthropic organization or charities.


Employer-subsidized medical and prescription insurance (including employer-subsidized health savings account)
Employer-subsidized dental insurance
Employer-subsidized vision insurance
Employee assistance program




Flexible spending accounts (Health and dependent care)
Annual fitness reimbursement
Wellness portal (includes personal coaching, trainings, etc.)



National MI Jobs Openings

Generous Health, Retirement Plans: National MI is proud to offer traditional PPO and HMO medical, dental, vision and prescription benefit plans with a very generous cost structure for employees: currently the company pays 85% of the cost and employees pay only 15% of the benefit premiums. In addition, should an employee choose a High Deductible Health Plan combined with a Health Savings Account, the plan is free to employees and the company pays the premium, as well as contributes quarterly to the employee’s Health Savings Account. The company also matches up to 4% of eligible employee contributions to their 401(k) Plans and there is immediate vesting of the company match.
Care for Elders and Children: To support our employees and their families, National MI offers a childcare and eldercare program. Families who may need dependent care for family members can utilize up to 15 days of company-sponsored emergency child care or elder care. Employees may use the company-funded child and elder care benefits at 400 child care centers and for 900 in-home care agencies in the US.


Basic and additional life insurance
Accidental death & dismemberment insurance
401(k) plan with employer matching contribution
Financial counseling




Short- and long-term disability insurance
Business travel insurance



National MI Jobs Openings


Work/Life Balance PTO: Upon hiring, all employees immediately begin accruing 20 days of PTO. Everyone with at least 1 year of service is eligible for an additional 10 days of PTO. We believe employees feel entrusted by the option to take this much paid time off, and thus they make sure their work gets done. We recognize that the holidays are an extremely busy time, so we give two additional paid days off to use in December or January. Employees tell us it’s another reason they really like working here. It gives them energy to start the New Year.


Paid time off (Minimum of 20 days)
Paid annual holidays
Employer-subsidized commuter program
On-site fitness facility




Community involvement
Emergency back-up child care
Voluntary benefits: Legal assistance, pet insurance and many other optional benefits



National MI Jobs Openings

What can prospective employees do to get our attention? We love to come across candidates who are already thinking about ways they could contribute to National MI. They have taken the time to become very familiar with our company and what we do, and know they have certain strengths and skills that will help National MI continue to grow. The ability to work well with others is also something we look for as we stress collaboration. We also look for candidates with enthusiasm and passion, who want a new challenge and to broaden their skill set. It’s refreshing to meet with prospective employees who truly love what they do, and are eager to bring that enthusiasm to National MI.
National MI Jobs Openings

From Sales Consulting to Underwriting and from Risk Operations to Policy and Loss Mitigation, National MI’s client-centric teams aim to prove to lenders that business-as-usual is no longer the standard for the mortgage insurance industry. National MI has gone to great lengths to recruit and train exceptional people in every department who are not only knowledgeable, but also love to help their clients succeed. Are you one of them?
 


National MI is an equal opportunity employer.

HomeInvestor Relations Corporate Governance 



 


Corporate Governance

	The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of NMI Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) oversees the management of the Company and our business.  The Board selects our Chief Executive Officer and in conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer selects the rest of our senior management team, which is responsible for operating our business.

	Board Leadership

	Bradley M. Shuster serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. 
	Because the Board also believes that strong, independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance, the Board has established the position of Lead Director.  The Lead Director is an independent director selected by the independent directors.  Steven L. Scheid has served as the Lead Director since the position was established in May 2012.  The Lead Director’s responsibilities include:


		acting as the primary contact between the Company and the independent directors, undertaking to meet or confer periodically with members of the Company's executive team regarding matters related to the business of the Company;

		assisting the Chairman of the Board, as necessary with conducting Board meetings;

		preparing agenda items for meetings of the Board and any committees thereof; and

		such other duties as the Board may from time to time assign to the Lead Director.


	The Board believes that a single leader serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with an experienced and engaged Lead Director, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Board and the Company at this time.

	Communicating with the Board

	Stockholders may communicate with the members of the Board, the Lead Director or the non-management members of the Board as a group, by sending a written communication to NMI Holdings, Inc., Attention: Secretary, 2100 Powell Street, 12th Floor, Emeryville, CA 94608.

	Board Committees

	The Board has four committees: Audit; Compensation; Governance and Nominating; and Risk.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
