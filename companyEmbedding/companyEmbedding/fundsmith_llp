Owners Manual



                Most fund managers will send you a glossy brochure. At Fundsmith we want you to have an Owner’s Manual. Why? Because your understanding of what we are trying to achieve and how we will approach it is a critical element in enabling us to attain our goal.

Our Analysis



                A selection of Fundsmith research papers and previously published articles can be found here.
            





The Unique Advantage of Equity Investing - 2017 - Investment in equities has a unique advantage over other asset classes which is rarely understood and almost never discussed.


Return Free Risk - 2013 - As investors we are taught that to obtain higher returns you must assume higher risk, but much of the evidence contradicts this assumption.


Banned words - 2013 - I have increasingly formed the view that there are some words and phrases which are used by company management, analysts and commentators which investors should be wary of.


Lessons from the Tour De France - 2012 - You can take at least one vital lesson for successful investment from the Tour. It has never been won by a rider who won all the stages, and it never will.


Share Buybacks - 2011 - Capital allocation decisions are amongst the most important decisions which management make on behalf of shareholders. In this document we analyse whether the current vogue for share buybacks is justified.







Third-Party Analysis on Fundsmith



                A selection of third party reports on Fundsmith can be found here.
            





Morningstar Fundsmith Report - 2017 - This is one of the strongest options for investors seeking exposure to high quality global equities.





An English language prospectus for the Fundsmith Equity Fund is available on request and via the Fundsmith website and investors should consult this document before purchasing shares in the fund. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and be affected by changes in exchange rates, and you may not get back the amount of your original investment. Fundsmith LLP does not offer investment advice or make any recommendations regarding the suitability of its product.

About Fundsmith Fundsmith is focused on delivering superior investment performance at a reasonable cost. It was established to be different from its peers so as to achieve a different result in line with Sir John Templeton’s axiom that “If you want to have a better performance than the crowd, you must do things differently from the crowd.” The rigorous research process of Fundsmith is central to what we do. We apply exacting standards to potential investments to produce a portfolio of resilient businesses with excellent performance. Minimising the costs we incur on behalf of our customers in implementing our strategy also sits at the heart of our philosophy. Fundsmith was established in 2010 by Terry Smith. The business is owned and controlled by its partners, who have worked closely together over many years, and is headquartered in London with an office in Connecticut, USA. It is structured to survive Terry Smith’s demise and continue with the same investment philosophy. All partners of the firm have a significant co-investment in our Funds delivering a clear alignment of interest. Ancillary activities are outsourced to some of the world's leading providers in order to deliver high-quality operations whilst allowing the Fundsmith team to focus on investment analysis, portfolio management and customer care. As at 31st December 2016 we managed £10bn on behalf of some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated wealth managers and private banks as well as for prominent families, charities, endowments and individuals invested in our fund range; Fundsmith Equity Fund (UK OEIC), Fundsmith Equity Fund Feeder (Luxembourg SICAV), Fundsmith Equity Fund L.P. (Delaware L.P.) and the Fundsmith Emerging Equities Trust plc (London Stock Exchange Listed Investment Trust).

Equity Fund Aim The Company will invest in equities on a global basis. The Company's approach is to be a long-term investor in its chosen stocks. It will not adopt short-term trading strategies. The Company has stringent investment criteria which the ACD, as investment manager, adheres to in selecting securities for the Company's investment portfolio. These criteria aim to ensure that the Company invests in:  high quality businesses that can sustain a high return on operating capital employed; businesses whose advantages are difficult to replicate; businesses which do not require significant leverage to generate returns; businesses with a high degree of certainty of growth from reinvestment of their cash flows at high rates of return; businesses that are resilient to change, particularly technological innovation; businesses whose valuation is considered by the Company to be attractive.  Investors should be aware that the application of these investment criteria significantly limits the number of potential investments for the Company's portfolio. It is envisaged that the investment portfolio of the Company will be concentrated, generally comprising between 20 and 30 stocks. The Company will not invest in derivatives and will not hedge any currency exposure arising from within the operations of an investee business nor from the holding of an investment denominated in a currency other than sterling.

Just a small number of high quality, resilient, global growth companies that are good value and which we intend to hold for a long time, and in which we invest our own money.  " Active Share measures how much the portfolio holdings differ from the benchmark index (MSCI World) i.e. a portfolio that is identical to the benchmark would have 0% active share. * The OCF (Ongoing Charges Figure) is the total expenses paid by the fund (excluding bank overdraft interest), annualised, against its average net asset value. The OCF will fluctuate as the average net assets and costs change. The OCF is updated following the publication of accounts for the periods ending 30th June and 31st December. ^ The PTR (Portfolio Turnover Ratio) has been calculated in accordance with the methodology laid down by the FCA. This compares the total share purchases and sales less total creations and liquidations with the average net asset value of the fund. > 7 Day Fund Liquidity is calculated based upon 30% of trailing 20 day average volume. < Gross Yield reflects the historic dividend income received by the fund in the preceding 12 months before the deduction of all expenses including management fees. Net Yield is Gross Yield less the deduction of all expenses including management fees i.e. Gross Yield less the OCF. In both cases we use the T Class Shares as reference. Please note that rates would vary for I Class and R Class shares. NB Where a position is being built for the fund the company name is not disclosed in factsheet data.
