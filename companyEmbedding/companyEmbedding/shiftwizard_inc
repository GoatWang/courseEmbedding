. This investment in 
      ShiftWizard is the first North Carolina-based investment for Rolling 
      Hills Ventures and Resolute Venture Partners.


                                        








Rolling Hills Ventures Managing Partner Richard Bovender and his team of 
      senior healthcare advisors recognized ShiftWizard’s innovation and 
      leadership opportunity in the healthcare industry. “The fact that the 
      company was founded by healthcare professionals was the first thing that 
      caught our attention. But, it was easy to see the value in ShiftWizard’s 
      SaaS healthcare workforce solution, and to understand the benefits 
      hospitals could achieve, including major cost savings,” said Bovender.


                                        








“For us, finding the right investment partners had to be about more than 
      just the money itself. It was very important for us to find investors 
      with the right expertise and the right relationships, to help 
      ShiftWizard expand our reach even further into the healthcare industry,” 
      explained Christian Pardue, co-founder, ShiftWizard.


                                        








The company also announced the addition of Joe Velk as CEO. Velk has 
      more than 25 years of investment and company building experience with 
      information technology companies. Prior to ShiftWizard, he spent the 
      past 16 years managing Contender Capital. He also co-managed The North 
      Carolina Enterprise Fund for 13 years and spent five years with 
      Intersouth Partners, an early-stage venture capital firm located in 
      North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park area.


                                        








Velk and Bovender will both join ShiftWizard’s board of directors along 
      with Jay Zeidman, managing partner at Resolute Venture Partners, and 
      company founders Christian Pardue and Shane Parker. Landon Gibbs, a 
      partner with Clayton Associates, will serve as a company advisor.


                                        








“We are proud of the organic growth and success we have already 
      experienced, but we are excited to leverage this funding and our new 
      leadership team to help even more healthcare organizations manage their 
      workforce successfully, while ultimately improving patient care,” added 
      Shane Parker, co-founder, ShiftWizard.

With more than 50 years of combined nursing experience and more than 24 
      years of direct patient care experience, ShiftWizard founders Shane 
      Parker, RN, and Christian Pardue, RN, set out to create a solution to 
      address the scheduling challenges and frustrations they directly 
      experienced throughout their careers. They were industry pioneers, 
      introducing the first 100 percent web-based scheduling solution for the 
      healthcare industry in 2007.

      delivering unmatched customer service has paid off, earning them a 
      nearly 100 percent customer retention rate and 98 percent customer 
      support satisfaction rate.

      the industry to offer a free on-site trial for qualified healthcare 
      organizations, which has resulted in a near 100 percent close rate.
