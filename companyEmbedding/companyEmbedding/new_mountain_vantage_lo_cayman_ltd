New Mountain Vantage launches New Mountain Vantage UCITS Fund on MontLake UCITS Platform

Launches & Fundraising











New Mountain Vantage Advisors has launched its US equity long/short fund on the MontLake UCITS platform. MontLake provides investors with access to a range of liquid, transparent and regulated investment products domiciled in Dublin. 
New Mountain Vantage is an affiliate of New Mountain Capital (NMC) a New York-based asset management firm with aggregate assets under management totalling more than USD15 billion.
 
New Mountain Vantage, founded in 2006, currently manages approximately USD2.9 billion across US long/short and benchmarked/long-only funds. The investment strategy is predominantly focused on bottom-up research, concentrating on mid and large-cap US companies.
 
The New Mountain Vantage team has significant experience in sourcing attractive investment opportunities through deep fundamental research in “defensive growth” areas of the economy. The team is supported by the broader NMC organisation founded by Steven Klinsky in 1999. NMC’s underlying industry knowledge and substantial institutional infrastructure provides differentiated idea-sourcing capabilities and creates a competitive edge.
 
Dan Riley, Portfolio Manager of New Mountain Vantage, says: “We are delighted to offer UCITS investors the opportunity to access our US equity long/short strategy.  We believe our investment approach is well suited to the UCITS structure and look forward to working with investors in the region.”
 
Cyril Delamare (pictured), CEO of ML Capital, says: “We are thrilled to be partnering with New Mountain Vantage. Their unique investment process coupled with a strong track record with US equities makes them appealing as a diversifier from an investor’s point of view. There is currently a limited selection of quality US long/short equity strategies in UCITS and our investor base welcomes the new entrant. The New Mountain Vantage Fund is a great addition to the UCITS universe and we look forward to growing this product.”

Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on October 30, 2006, as amended, relating to the common stock of the Company.

Except as provided in its Schedule 13D, the Participants are not acting together with any other person for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of securities of NFG.
Any intention of any other person to act together with the Participants for any of these purposes is expressly disclaimed by the Participants.

This presentation is for general information purposes only.  It does not have regard to the specific investment objective, financial situation, suitability or the particular need of any
specific person who reads this presentation, and should not be taken as advice on the merits of any investment decision.  The views expressed herein are those of Vantage and are
based on or derived from publicly available information.

Except for historical information contained in this presentation, this presentation, including the analyses and views of Vantage and Schlumberger Data & Consulting ("Schlumberger")
contained herein, include forward-looking statements with respect to, among other things, the operating performance of NFG.  These statements may be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as the words "expects," "intends," "believes," "anticipates" and other terms with similar meaning indicating possible future events or actions or
potential impact on the business or shareholders of NFG.  Vantage's views and these forward-looking statements are based solely on publicly available information and on various
assumptions that are inherently subject to significant economic, competitive, and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and have been
included solely for illustrative purposes.  These risks and uncertainties include, among others, the ability to successfully solicit sufficient proxies to elect the Proponents' Nominees to
the NFG'S board of directors, the ability of the Proponents' Nominees to influence the management of NFG and to improve the operating performance of NFG, and risk factors
associated with the business of NFG, as described by NFG on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, and in other periodic reports of NFG, which are available at
no charge at the website of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Vantage recognizes
that there may be confidential information in the possession of NFG that could lead NFG to disagree with Vantage's conclusions. Other shareholders or potential shareholders of NFG
should make their own determination concerning an investment in NFG.  Vantage reserves the right to change any of its views expressed herein at any time as it deems appropriate.
Vantage disclaims any obligations to update the information contained herein.

Vantage and its affiliates manage funds that are in the business of trading - buying and selling - public securities.  It is possible that there will be developments in the future that
cause Vantage to change its position regarding the Company and possibly increase, reduce, dispose of, or change the form of its investments in the Company.

Additional Information

The Proponents intend to file a proxy statement with the SEC on Schedule 14A and the Proponents expect to mail a proxy statement to the Company's shareholders containing
information about the proxy solicitation.  INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT CAREFULLY WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE.

The proxy statement will contain important information about the Participants, including the Nominees, and related matters.  Investors and security holders may obtain these
documents, when available, free of charge by contacting the Proponents' proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, toll-free at (877) 456-3422. Banks and Brokers may call collect
at 212-750-5833.  The proxy statement will also be available through the web site maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.  In addition to the proxy statement, the Proponents may file
other proxy information with the SEC.

The Participants may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Company shareholders in connection with the proposed proxy solicitation.  Information about the
Reporting Persons and their ownership of Company common stock is set forth in the Schedule 13D.  Information about the Nominees and other information regarding the participants
in the proxy solicitation will be contained in the proxy statement and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC when they become available.

I.  The Appalachia Opportunity




�







Overview of Appalachia Opportunity

Appalachia is the oldest producing basin in the United States

Appalachia has several attractive characteristics

Long-lived gas reserves

Proximity to markets

 NFG is one of the largest landowners in the basin

Controls 939,000 acres (roughly the size of Rhode Island)

~790,000 in Pennsylvania; ~150,000 in New York(1)

Significant fee mineral ownership; approximately ~600,000 acres(2)

Roughly ~450,000 acres estimated by management to be undeveloped(3)

Vantage believes that NFG has opportunities in at least two formations

Shallow Sands: NFG has had a 96% success rate for new wells from 2001 - 2006(4)

Marcellus Shale: A significant potential opportunity, now being pursued by top E&P competitors

Vantage Believes That, Before Vantage Became Involved In NFG, NFG Had Been
Underinvesting in Appalachia

Historically, in Vantage's view, NFG underinvested in Appalachia

Did not show a map of acreage to shareholders

Had not disclosed Proved Undeveloped, Probable, and Possible ("3-P") reserves

Averaged only 61 wells per year (2001 - 2006)

Instead, NFG had spent over $530 million dollars from 2001 to 2006 on what Vantage views
as an unsuccessful exploration program in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, while spending
only $79 million cumulatively in Appalachia over the same five-year period

Vantage believes NFG has misallocated capital in its E&P business

Vantage Commissioned Schlumberger To Help Set New Strategic Direction For NFG's
Appalachian Acreage

As explained above, in early 2006 when Vantage began its NFG investment, NFG had issued no public
map of its Appalachian acreage, had no 3-P reserves for Appalachia, and was drilling only 61 wells per
year on average between 2001 and 2006, even as Range Resources, Atlas Energy, Equitable
Resources and others were moving aggressively in the region

Vantage believed it was necessary to engage a highly reputable third party to analyze data to determine
whether Appalachia could be a much more valuable asset for shareholders if properly developed

Vantage commissioned Schlumberger in March 2006 to assess the full reserve potential of all NFG's
acreage position in Appalachia, including the potential number of shallow well drilling locations, an
optimal long-term drilling plan, and the potential cash flows and net present value of the asset

Vantage presented a summary of Schlumberger's work to NFG in 2006 and encouraged NFG to retain
Schlumberger directly, in order to reproduce the same high level strategic analysis for all shareholders.
The Company chose not to do so

Vantage believes that the actions and successes of other E&P companies in the region lead to the same
strategic direction as the Schlumberger analysis, even if the Schlumberger work did not exist

Vantage believes that the Vantage and Schlumberger work is not inconsistent with NFG's internal data
and the Netherland, Sewell report; rather, Vantage believes that Schlumberger is addressing a different,
broader and more strategic set of questions (i.e., what all 939,000 acres could be worth if developed and
managed optimally)



�







Vantage Work With Schlumberger Indicates Major Untapped Opportunities

Work Summary

Schlumberger reviewed publicly available production data for a large sample set (approximately
40,000 wells) located in all counties where NFG owns acreage

The data are from many operators, not just NFG

Schlumberger developed a modeled "type curve" or decline curve for the low risk, shallow horizons
(Upper Devonian / Clinton Medina) in NFG's counties

Schlumberger modeled the economics of a potential drilling plan based on these average "type
curves" and based on capital and operating cost assumptions in accordance with NFG's estimates

Conclusions

At a natural gas price of $7.50 per mcf and an oil price of $70 per barrel, Schlumberger's model
drilling program yields EBITDA of approximately $218 million in year five of the program, and a net
present value at a 10% discount rate of approximately $1.1 billion(1)

Vantage views Schlumberger's work as strategic and directional, rather than as a precise point
estimate of ultimate value

The Marcellus Shale opportunity would be in addition to this shallow level opportunity

Marcellus Shale May Be Another Major Potential Opportunity

NFG controls approximately 860,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale(1)

Recent preliminary indicators from competitors operating in the Marcellus Shale are encouraging

Range Resources and Atlas Energy have both indicated that vertical test wells in the Marcellus Shale
are showing recoverable reserves of 0.6 - 1.0 Bcfe per well(2)

Horizontal results are expected to yield greater recoverable reserves(3)

Range Resources estimates 2.5 - 5.0 Tcfe of unrisked potential reserves on its 420,000 leasehold acres in
Pennsylvania(4)

Morgan Stanley values these resources at ~$2.0 billion in risked net asset value as of January 2007(5)

Atlas Energy estimates 1.0 - 2.0 Tcfe of potential net gas reserves on 230,000 net acres(6)

EOG Resources estimates 1.2 Tcfe of potential reserves on its average position of 227,000 net acres in
Pennsylvania(7)

NFG has almost two times the acreage of Range Resources; almost four times the acreage of Atlas
Energy and EOG Resources

In November 2006, NFG partnered with EOG Resources to pursue a Marcellus Shale exploration program;
however, drilling has commenced only on a limited number of wells so far, and the Company has not
committed to disclose reserve potential estimates by any date

Netherland, Sewell Report to NFG Reviewed Only Small Part of Big Picture

Vantage believes that the Netherland, Sewell report to NFG did not address the key strategic question that
Vantage has asked regarding the full resource potential of NFG's acreage

Only evaluated ~200,000 out of 939,000 acres(1)

Appears to have only evaluated the lowest risk infill drilling potential

Probable and possible locations are based on only one step-out from a subset of NFG wells

No third party offset wells were evaluated

The Netherland, Sewell report to NFG, as published, left open critical questions

Does not address whether well recoveries may be greater with superior operational capabilities

Does not benchmark NFG's cost structure

Does not include a drilling plan or development plan

Does not consider the Marcellus Shale or other high potential horizons

However, the Netherland, Sewell report to NFG does indicate substantial potential

According to the Netherland, Sewell report, Proved Undeveloped reserves per well average 135 Mmcfe; Probable and
Possible reserves per well average 121 Mmcfe and 120 Mmcfe respectively(2)

These estimates imply significant upside potential from NFG's reported results of 97 Mmcfe reserves per well for its shallow
gas program in 2007(1)

At 600 wells per year and 135 Mmcfe per well, value creation would be substantial

The Company indicated it expects proved reserves to grow as drilling continues

"Although Netherland, Sewell has identified only approximately 1,000 locations that can be classified as
having undeveloped reserves, we believe that, at current commodity price levels and well costs, hundreds
of wells will be drillable each year for the foreseeable future. We fully expect that the step-out locations we
drill each year, as well as the exploratory wells we will drill on the acreage that is now classified as only
having 'Prospective Resources' will yield additional locations that will ultimately be classifiable in the
Proved, Probable, and Possible categories."

Best Path May Be Sale or Partnering of Assets

E&P operators have expressed interest to Vantage in NFG's assets

Vantage believes these operators could apply the technical skills to NFG's assets needed
for full value creation

All strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value should be carefully considered

Merger of NFG's E&P business with an existing E&P MLP for cash and units

Tax-free separation of part or all of NFG's E&P business to NFG shareholders

Tax-free separation of part or all of NFG's E&P business in sponsored spin transaction




�







Key is to Get the Board to Act

Vantage believes major opportunities require a NFG effort to:

Examine all options to maximize shareholder value

Hire top-tier investment bankers

Hold open discussions with strategic partners

Drive forward the tough decisions

Vantage believes shareholders need fresh Board representatives who:

Act like owners focused on increasing shareholder value

Will advocate a fair and full process

Will advocate timely Board action with clear deadlines and deliverables

Vantage believes shareholders need a "seat at the table"



�







II.  The MLP Opportunity



�







NFG Has Assets Appropriate For MLPs

Vantage believes NFG's pipeline assets are appropriate to hold in an MLP structure

Lower cost of capital enables acquisition growth strategy

Opportunity for incentive distribution rights at the General Partner level

Vantage's advisers have not identified any regulatory, tax or business reasons why the
pipeline cannot be put into an MLP

Vantage believes NFG's California asset is appropriate for MLP structure or sale to an MLP
operator

Large asset; long reserve life

Low maintenance capex

Appalachia drop-down opportunity into an MLP

Captive source of organic growth as reserves are proved up

Unique and positive investment story among E&P MLPs

III.  Sale of Non-Core Assets




�







Vantage Believes NFG Has Several Non-Core Businesses to Divest

Gulf of Mexico E&P Assets. In Vantage's view:

High risk exploration portfolio

High finding and development costs

High cost operating environment

No competitive advantage or strategic purpose

Timber and Saw Mill Assets. In Vantage's view:

Non-strategic legacy asset

Minor earnings contributor

NFG's most recent timber sale (2003) suggests potential for accretive sale price(1)

Landfill Gas & Horizon Power. In Vantage's view:

Non-strategic assets

Limited earnings contributions

Vantage believes that estimated proceeds from divestitures of ~$450
million can be achieved and reinvested into core businesses(2)

  (1)  NFG sold 70,000 acres for $186.3m, or $2,661 per acre; based on NFG press release dated Aug. 1, 2003

  (2)  Refer to slide 5; $450m is approximately the mid-point of the reference range

NFG's Corporate Governance Structure Falls Short of Best Practice

Shareholders have not been afforded the opportunity to approve NFG's poison
pill, which is triggered at a very low threshold of 10%

Directors are not elected annually

Elk County Overview

Overview

After receiving initial Schlumberger report on all
acreage, Vantage engaged a land man to work
with Schlumberger team to provide greater detail
in a specific county

Objective was to approximate a 3-P reserve study
in one of NFG's largest counties

Findings compliant with Society of Petroleum
Engineers' guidelines

Methodology

Data sourced actual NFG land positions from title
records in Elk County courthouse; well locations
from state database

Analyzed over 197,000 acres

Plotted all well locations on map

Determined reserves for each existing well

Used Proved Developed Producing ("PDP")
reserves to determine Proved Undeveloped
("PUD") reserves

Used average reserves to estimate Probables and
Possibles

Schlumberger Reserve Estimates for
NFG's Acreage in Elk County(1)

Schlumberger's Analysis Was Further Confirmed By Elk County Leasehold Work

  (1)  Based solely on publicly available information; unrisked reserves of 919 Bcfe (Probables risked at 60% and Possibles risked at 40%)
