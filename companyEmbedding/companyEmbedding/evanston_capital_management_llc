Topical Research     
Smart Beta, Alternative Beta, Exotic Beta, Risk Factor, Style Premia, and Risk Premia Investing: Data Mining, Arbitraged Away, or Here to Stay?  The white paper outlines foundational characteristics of smart beta strategies and the impact of data mining and arbitrage on historical backtests when attempting to calculate accurate forward-looking return estimates for such strategies. The key identifying assumption for the particular smart betas and time periods analyzed is motivated by Nobel Laureate Eugene Fama’s famous 1991 Efficient Capital Markets survey paper (i.e. “Efficient Capital Markets: II”).   Pete Hecht, Senior Investment Strategist, analyzed both backtested and actual performance data over a 25-year-period and found that all of the performance metrics decreased during the out-of-sample period. The out-of-sample performance reductions ranged from 30% to 71%, suggesting that data mining and arbitrage play a material, economically significant role in performance expectations.   Download the Report    
Fact or Fiction: Stocks and Bonds are Less Risky for Long-Term Investors  Conventional wisdom suggests that long-term investors face less investment risk, thus impacting their strategic asset allocation. While there are many reasons for risk to vary with investment horizon, the typical explanations (e.g., time diversification) are misguided. This new research piece provides a framework for evaluating risk at different investment horizons, which ultimately both challenges and clarifies conventional wisdom.   Download the Report    
How to Evaluate Hedge Funds or Any New Investment  This piece provides a framework for evaluating new investments in the context of the entire portfolio. It introduces and promotes the use of the Appraisal Ratio, an easy to calculate, risk-adjusted performance statistic that accounts for a new investment’s expected return, risk, and diversification attributes in a manner consistent with Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory. Common performance evaluation mistakes and misperceptions are also discussed.   Download the Report    
Risk Parity Is Not a Hedge Fund Strategy & Other Common Risk Parity Misperceptions  Over the past few years, risk parity has become a component of most investors’ lexicon and, possibly, portfolios. Risk parity products have also become more common in many asset management firms’ offerings. However, even with all of the attention on risk parity, there is still a significant amount of confusion surrounding it. This piece will examine some of the common risk parity misperceptions and provides an alternative, clarifying explanation.   Download the Report    
Hedge Fund Replication: Is it Appropriate for You?  Recognizing the investment community’s significant interest in hedge fund replication and related topics such as alternative beta, the report takes an in-depth look at these complex attempts to mimic the core risk and return properties of certain hedge fund strategies within a more accessible investment form than traditional hedge fund investing. The paper discusses the two primary types of replication, “top down” and “bottom up,” reviews how replication can help improve manager underwriting and monitoring, looks at the issue of liquidity rights, and discusses expected changes in investment returns given the growing proliferation of replication products.   Download the Report

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

ECM In The News  






		Adam Blitz on the Capital Allocators Podcast
	
















              Jul 21, 2017


	Listen to Adam Blitz, ECM's CEO & Chief Investment Officer, discuss today's hedge fund landscape on the Capital Allocators Podcast hosted by Ted Seides.





			Pete Hecht wants investors to measure alpha, not just tout it
		
















              Mar 15, 2016


		Alpha. All hedge fund managers claim they have it. Evanston Capital's Senior Investment Strategist, Pete Hecht, Ph.D., knows that few of them actually do, and he’s focused on keeping them honest about it. 





				Episode 72 with Pete Hecht - Accredited Investor Markets
			
















              Mar 11, 2016


			Senior Investment Strategist, Pete Hecht, Ph.D., and Accredited Investor Markets Radio host, Chris Cahill, go beyond the hype and have an honest discussion on the topic of liquid alternatives.  (Begins around minute 12)





					Correlation – Just One Leg of the Investment Stool
				
















              Feb 23, 2016


				Why isn’t Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) / Global Macro the obvious hedge fund strategy for a typical institutional investor? Compared to a diversified hedge fund program, it presents a lower stock/bond correlation. And doesn’t everyone say, the whole point of a portfolio is to assemble uncorrelated return streams?





						Should You Fire Your Risk Parity Manager?
					
















              Feb 22, 2016


					Risk parity strategies came under pressure in 2015 as markets sold off risk en masse and asset classes fell across the board. The performance was a reminder that the strategy, which relies on diversification across equities, fixed income, emerging markets, commodities, etc. and then using leverage to boost returns from a relatively diluted basket of components, is inherently tied to beta, not alpha. However, the idea behind risk parity remains a sound one over long periods of time, writes Peter Hecht of Evanston Capital Management, as long as investors remember what it is, and what it is not





							Long-Term Investors Averse to Permanent Loss of Capital Owe Volatility an Apology
						
















              Dec 01, 2015


						Defining and measuring risk is foundational to investment management. Although there are many legitimate risk measures available, today's discussion will focus on volatility. Why? First, volatility is the easiest to understand and happens to be the “work horse” of applied modern portfolio theory, which is why it's taught in every classroom and continuously discussed on financial market channels such as CNBC and Bloomberg. Secondly, and more importantly, volatility is unfairly under assault by many smart investors focused on the long term and averse to a permanent loss of capital.





								Unhedged Commentary: Clearing Up Confusion Around Risk Parity and Market Sell-Offs
							
















              Sep 29, 2015


							It seems as though just about everyone in the investment community has pontificated on the role that risk parity strategies play in market sell¬offs like the one in August. Unfortunately, many of the views are coming from possibly uninformed or biased parties, creating confusion and the need for clarification. I’d like to move the debate forward by focusing on the key risk parity portfolio construction technique possibly contributing to market sell¬offs: volatility targeting. To understand the recent debate in the media, you need to understand volatility targeting and how it is used by risk parity managers. 





									Are You Properly Evaluating Your Hedge Fund Manager’s Performance?
								
















              Sep 11, 2015


								History provides so many opportunities for learning – even for hedge funds and their  investors. Rewind: In 2013 and 2014, hedge funds were criticized for not keeping up with the S&P 500. Fast forward to the present time: In August 2015, despite the average hedge fund outperforming the S&P 500, hedge funds were still criticized for losing money in aggregate while  simultaneously being congratulated for finally making money on their short books.

What does this all mean? In my opinion, confusion. People are still confused about how to evaluate hedge fund managers (or any active manager), and the concepts involved are foundational to investment management.






										How Hedge Fund Long Positions Show Skill While Losing Money in August
									
















              Sep 08, 2015


									August was a tough month for financial markets.  The S&P 500 was down over 6%, and with respect to hedge funds, the typical hedge fund lost money in August.  Conventional wisdom criticized manager long positions and praised short positions, but losses on the long book often overwhelmed the gains on the short book.

Did hedge funds fail?  Not necessarily.  But it does represent a teachable moment.





											Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) – A Complement, Not a Substitute
										
















              Aug 03, 2015


										Let me be clear: I support thoughtfully implemented Global Tactical Asset Allocation (“GTAA”)/Global Macro strategies. But GTAA/Global Macro strategies aren’t a catch-all for building an alternatives allocation, let alone a substitute for a diversified hedge fund program. Sightings of this errant substitution started a few years back and have become more commonplace as the “liquid alternatives” segment has increased in popularity, but it needs to stop.





												Why Wealth Managers Should Take a Look at Endowments
											
















              Jul 28, 2015


											Can a registered investment adviser (RIA) construct a portfolio structured along the lines of the endowment model? A good place to start to answer this question would be with another question: If you could do it, why would you want to?





													3 Things to Consider Before Pursuing a Strategic Asset Allocation
												
















              Jul 14, 2015


												At a conference I attended recently, the question “do you have too much equity risk?” came up during a risk parity discussion. One of the investors said his portfolio wasn't over allocated to equity risk since he had a long-term investment horizon.

His claim: equities are less risky for long-term investors. He reasoned that with a long enough investment horizon, the good and bad return years cancel each other out, leaving the investor with an almost guaranteed return. This logic resonated with many of the other conference attendees.





														New Tactics Boost Big Fund-of-Funds Managers
													
















              May 28, 2015


													HOBOKEN, NJ - The combined assets of the 25 largest fund-of-funds managers grew at a faster rate than the multi-manager sector as a whole last year. 





															Finally, a Practical Solution for Decomposing Returns into Alpha and Beta

														For an industry that uses the word “alpha” like it's going out of style, I find it amazing the asset management profession has made so little progress when it comes to actually trying to measure it in practice. Given its importance to active management (no alpha = no active management industry) and given all of the verbal airtime “alpha” receives, you would think managers and investors would spend a healthy amount of time trying to actually measure it on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case.





																How to Evaluate Hedge Funds: the Under-Utilised Measure of Consistent Alpha
															
















              Dec 05, 2014


															Benchmarking hedge funds can be challenging, but as a former finance professor, I experience heartburn every time I hear the investment community criticize hedge funds for not keeping up with the S&P 500. It is the same type of heartburn I felt when investors thought hedge funds demonstrated skill when they outperformed the S&P 500 in 2008. Both comments reflect a fundamental misunderstanding on how to evaluate hedge funds……or any new investment.

																				Common Risk Parity Misperceptions
																			
















              Jul 16, 2014


																			Over the past few years, risk parity has become a component of most investors’ lexicons and, possibly, portfolios. Risk parity products have also become more common in many asset management firms’ offerings. However, even with all of the attention on risk parity there is still a significant amount of confusion surrounding it.
