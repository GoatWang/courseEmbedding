Technology Overview


CMS water-based carrier contains active ingredients that spread evenly throughout the solution, providing the highest level of bioavailability and surface area coverage. The solution “wets” hard-to-reach surfaces and provides improved effectiveness.




Carrier Technology
 
Each CMS carrier contains an active ingredient, these active ingredients will spread out evenly throughout the solution, providing the highest level of bioavailability and surface area coverage.
 
Dual Hurdle Inhibition
 
In the case of microbial control, the CMS carrier technology creates a more complete and effective microbial shield with greater efficiency through dual hurdle inhibition: The bacterial membrane is weakened by the carrier solution -and- the proprietary ion solution disrupts the metabolic system of bacteria.


Product Benefits
 
     • Carrier based technology that is highly versatile
     • Extremely stable - even at high temperatures
     • Replaces or reduces harsh chemicals
     • Dual hurdle inhibition
 
Would you like additional information?
