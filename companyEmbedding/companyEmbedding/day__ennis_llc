Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

The Right Plan Can Organize Your Financial Life.
At Day & Ennis, we begin working with our clients by listening to them. We want to understand your personal and financial goals and concerns. Once we’ve helped you prioritize them, we develop a strategy to help you achieve success.
Your outlook will become clear as we integrate virtually every aspect of your financial life into a single comprehensive plan. We include cash flow and retirement planning, investment planning, insurance and risk management, income tax planning and estate planning. Through working together, we can offer advice based on your unique situation. The planning process helps us develop cost saving ideas and the most effective financial strategy for you.
Here are some benefits you can anticipate from working with Day & Ennis:

Fee-Only Financial Advice – As fee-only planners, we have no vested interest in selling you anything. We are members of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (www.NAPFA.org) and receive no income from sales of investments. We act as fiduciaries, putting your financial interests ahead of our own. So you can count on unbiased recommendations. We believe that the combination of our due diligence and research can more than make up for fee expenses over the long run, regardless of the return environment.


Time savings – Developing and implementing a financial plan requires careful thought in quite a few areas. Factors such as risk, time frame, goals, cash flow, taxes, investment strategy and monitoring can be overwhelming to the individual investor. Even those who have the expertise to do this often lack the time and dedication it requires.


Competitive Performance and Risk Management –We work with each client to develop an investment strategy that helps you achieve your goals at your comfort level of risk.  We use a number of techniques to help control the risk in the portfolio. Primarily, we seek broad diversification through asset class allocation. We provide further diversification through mutual funds that shift investments among equities, commodities and bonds.


Broad Diversification — We believe in broadly diversified portfolios that include allocations to US Large Cap, US Large Cap Value, US Small Cap, US Small Cap Value, Real Estate, Commodities, International Large Cap, Emerging Markets and Short and Intermediate Term Fixed Income securities. To achieve diversification, we use low cost index and asset class mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF’s). Each of these funds or ETFs invests in several hundred and in some cases several thousand companies. This eliminates specific company risk, so we don’t have to worry about companies going bankrupt such as Enron, WorldCom and Colonial Bank. This also gives us the market exposure we want and the expected returns for different segments of the market. And that improves the performance of your portfolio.


Low Expenses –   We try to keep investment expenses as low as possible. Our clients are free to choose where they keep their investments, but if they do not have a preference we recommend Charles Schwab & Company, a discount brokerage firm. The fees are low and the choice of investment products is broad. We’ve had success in developing cost saving ideas and strategies during the course of preparing comprehensive financial plans for our clients. We believe we can do the same for you.


Peace of Mind – Knowing that you have Personal Financial Specialists working with you to develop a comprehensive plan and monitor its performance gives you a sense of peace about your investments. We keep you informed about developments in the markets that may affect you through quarterly reports, newsletters and regularly scheduled consultations.

It’s not easy for most people to find the time or the information to do this kind of in-depth planning by themselves. That’s why so many prefer to work with Day & Ennis instead. Why not call for an appointment today?
