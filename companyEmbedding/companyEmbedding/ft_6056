 Disney quoted Pocahontas as wanting to “paint with all the colors of the wind.” With their colorful bands, the Tag Heuer connected watches will allow you to paint with all the colors of “time.” Add to your collection and watch your wrists offer flashes of the rainbow with a differently-colored band every time you step out. Tag Heuer Connected Watches can make you the most “colorful” person in town.TAG Heuer Connected SBF8A8001.10BF0608Retail Price: $2,300.00Sale Price:  $2,195.00TAG Heuer Connected

                    Drive-Thru Pickup
                

                    This option is available for our in-stock and special order items.  Simply order online and drive to one of our store/warehouse locations to pick up your order.  Due to the limited availability and specific qualities of our special order products, NFM must assess a 25% non-refundable deposit.  This deposit must be made with a major credit or debit card.  We offer an option that allows you to use your Nebraska Furniture Mart Card for the remainder of the balance.  To complete an order this way, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
                



                    Driveway Delivery
                

                    On your scheduled delivery date, you’ll be given a 2-hour time window that you can expect to receive your delivery. Our drivers can also call ahead of time if it has been requested. With Driveway Delivery, our delivery drivers will place your items on the nearest sidewalk, driveway, or inside your garage. The items will be left in their factory packaging. If you live in an apartment or if you cannot safely move the items into your home, you should consider upgrading to In-Home Delivery.
                



                    In-Home Delivery
                

                    With this White Glove Delivery Service, you will receive a phone call 48 hours prior to your delivery that will set up and confirm a two hour window for your item’s scheduled arrival.  At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include the setup of Ready to Assemble products. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page.  If you have any questions about assembly please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.

Small town living in Robertson County TN.


                    
                    Springfield TN has lots and lots of farmland and woods.  It's a pretty slow paced area but it's only 30 mins or so away from Nashville TN.  

If you happen to be in Springfield...

                    Springfield TN has lots and lots of farmland and woods.  It's a pretty slow paced area but it's only 30 mins or so away from Nashville TN.  

If you happen to be in Springfield and are hungry, try out the Catfish House.  The potions are large and it's a local favorite. I think they also own the Catfish house in Clarksville TN.  You have to like fried foods and sweet tea, if you do, you will like it here.

Beaufort, SC - Steeped in History

                    Marines throughout the world know Beaufort, SC as the home the Marine Corp training depot, Parris Island.  The Marines began using Parris Island in 1915 as a training boot camp, and today graduate over 20,000 recruits a year.  Many of these recruits never get to see the prisine beauty of Beaufort, nor learn about the history that surrounds them.  Beaufort is situated just next to Port Royal, SC, another town with a rich history.  

As the county seat for Beaufort County, Beaufort is surrounded by Lady's Island, Port Royal, St. Helena Island, Fripp Island, Dataw Island, Parris Island, and Hunting Island - to name a few.  Its written history begins over 500 years ago.  Pick up any history book on the civil war and Beaufort will be everywhere.  It is home not only to Parris Island, but also the Beaufort Air Station.  Hunting Island is the most visited state park in South Carolina because of its untouched natual beaches.

                    Beaufort is a small town with a rich history. There are lots of great neighborhoods to recommend, Mossy Oaks being one of the most popular. The new Spanish Moss Trail is a great place for running, walking and biking and also for enjoying water views. The annual Beaufort Water Festival is a treat for locals and tourists alike. Beaufort is home to many active-duty military personnel at the Marine Corps Depot Parris Island and MCAS Beaufort, as well as veterans who have chosen to make Beaufort their home in retirement. There are many public access points to the water for fishing and boating, as well as gated communities that include private docks and boat launches among the amenities they offer.

                    The Beaufort area experienced a brisk real estate market this summer, and,as always, the market quieted down after Labor Day, once students were back in school.  That can mean that opportunities for bargains open up for buyers, as sellers opt to lower prices in order to make a sale.  But, with inventories down, sellers have less competition, too, and the situation varies by neighborhood and by price point - the picture in Mossy Oaks as a whole may not apply in Cottage Farms, and the Point neighborhood and the Pigeon Point neighborhood may differ widely.
