Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

2011[edit]
In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million.[19] In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker Cephalon Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful.[20] In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO Eugene Melnyk was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the Ontario Securities Commission. In the year before the merger with Valeant, Melnyk had settled with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 after having previously paid $1 million to settle other claims with the SEC.[21] In July 2011, Valeant acquired Ortho Dermatologics from Janssen Pharmaceuticals for $345 million.

2014[edit]
In January 2014, Valeant acquired Solta Medical for approximately $250 million.[38] In May 2014, Nestle acquired the commercial rights to sell Valeant's filler and toxin products for $1.4 billion.[39] In July 2014, Valeant acquired PreCision Dermatology Inc for $475 million, a deal aimed at strengthening the firm’s skin products business.[40][41] Along with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant made a bid to acquire Allergan; however, in November 2014, Allergan announced that it would be acquired by Actavis in a $66 billion transaction.[42][43]
2015[edit]
On April 1, 2015, Valeant completed the purchase of gastrointestinal treatment drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion after outbidding Endo Pharmaceuticals.[44][45] On the final day of trading, Salix shares traded for $172.81, giving a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion. In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

2011[edit]
In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million.[19] In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker Cephalon Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful.[20] In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO Eugene Melnyk was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the Ontario Securities Commission. In the year before the merger with Valeant, Melnyk had settled with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 after having previously paid $1 million to settle other claims with the SEC.[21] In July 2011, Valeant acquired Ortho Dermatologics from Janssen Pharmaceuticals for $345 million.

2014[edit]
In January 2014, Valeant acquired Solta Medical for approximately $250 million.[38] In May 2014, Nestle acquired the commercial rights to sell Valeant's filler and toxin products for $1.4 billion.[39] In July 2014, Valeant acquired PreCision Dermatology Inc for $475 million, a deal aimed at strengthening the firm’s skin products business.[40][41] Along with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant made a bid to acquire Allergan; however, in November 2014, Allergan announced that it would be acquired by Actavis in a $66 billion transaction.[42][43]
2015[edit]
On April 1, 2015, Valeant completed the purchase of gastrointestinal treatment drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion after outbidding Endo Pharmaceuticals.[44][45] On the final day of trading, Salix shares traded for $172.81, giving a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion. In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Breaking            
ADP stock jumps 10% in midday trade on reports of Ackman stake
Shares of Automatic Data Processing Inc. jumped more than 10% in Thursday afternoon trade following a Bloomberg News report that Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management had taken a stake in payroll company ADP . Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter, indicating that Ackman had recently bought shares in ADP and that he may increase his position. The report didn't specify the size of the activist investor's position. ADP's shares have climbed 13.1% so far this year, compared with a 10.1% year-to-date return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 10.6% rise for the S&P 500 index  thus far in 2017, and a 20% surge for the Nasdaq Composite Index  over the same period. Ackman has been notably linked to recent bullish bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. , which he exited in March after racking up a $4 billion loss on his investment. He is also notoriously wagering that nutritional-supplement company Herbalife Ltd.'s shares  will fall to zero. However, that company's stock is up 40% so far this year.

Valeant agrees to sell Obagi Medical Products for $190 million in cash
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  said Monday it has reached an agreement to sell its Obagi Medical Products business to Haitong International Zhonghua Finance Acquisition Fund I LP for $190 million in cash. Obagi is a specialty drug company that makes products aimed at premature skin aging, skin damage and other skin problems that are mostly available from dermatologists, plastic surgeons and medical spas. The deal is expected to close in the second half and proceeds will be used to repay term loan debt. Valeant said the company was expected to generate net profit of $85 million and non-GAAP EBITDA of $30 million. Valeant shares were slightly higher premarket, and have gained 19% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

Valeant redeems $500 million of debt, on track to meet or exceed $5 billion debt reduction goal 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  said Thursday it is redeeming the roughly $500 million of outstanding 6.75% notes that mature in 2018 using cash on hand, as it continues to work to reduce its debt burden. The troubled drug company, which has come through an accounting scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO, said it has now reduced its debt by more than $4.8 billion since the first quarter of 2016, and is on track to meet its goal of paying down $5 billion in debt within 18 months of August 2016. The company has no major debt maturities and no mandatory amortization requirements through 2019, giving it needed breathing room. "We are confident we will not only meet, but also exceed our debt reduction commitment early," Chief Executive Joseph Papa said in a statement. Valeant shares rose 1.7% premarket, and are now up 17% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Valeant pays down $811 million of term loans, shares rise
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. shares  jumped 1.2% in premarket trade Monday, after the company said it has paid down $811 million of senior secured loans, keeping it on track with its debt-reduction goals. The company said it used the proceeds of the recent sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC to pay off the loans. "With this transaction, all mandatory amortization has been paid through 2019," the company wrote in a statement. Valeant has reduced its debt by more than $4.3 billion since the end of the first quarter of 2016. The company, which started on a debt reduction track after an accounting scandal that battered its reputation and led to the ouster of its longtime chief executive, said it still expects to pay down $5 billion in debt using the proceeds of asset sales and free cash flow within 18 months of August 2016. Shares have gained 12% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.3%.

Valeant's stock surges after largest shareholder John Paulson elected to board
Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  surged 5% in premarket trade Monday, after the drug maker said billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson was elected to its board of directors. Paulson's hedge fund, Paulson & Co. Inc., is Valeant's largest shareholder with 19.4 million shares, or 5.6% of the shares outstanding as of the end of March, according to FactSet. "We are pleased to welcome John to Valeant's board of directors," said Valeant Chief Executive Joseph Papa. "With his significant business and financial expertise, John will be a strong addition to the board. His experience will be especially valuable as we continue to execute on our transformational strategy to turnaround Valeant." Earlier this year, hedge fund manager and large shareholder Bill Ackman had resigned from Valeant's board, and sold his 10% stake in the company amid mounting investment losses. The stock, on course to open at a four-month high, has tumbled 12.8% year to date through Friday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceutical ETF  has gained 5.6% and the S&P 500 [: spx] has climbed 8.7%.

Breaking            
ADP stock jumps 10% in midday trade on reports of Ackman stake
Shares of Automatic Data Processing Inc. jumped more than 10% in Thursday afternoon trade following a Bloomberg News report that Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management had taken a stake in payroll company ADP . Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter, indicating that Ackman had recently bought shares in ADP and that he may increase his position. The report didn't specify the size of the activist investor's position. ADP's shares have climbed 13.1% so far this year, compared with a 10.1% year-to-date return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 10.6% rise for the S&P 500 index  thus far in 2017, and a 20% surge for the Nasdaq Composite Index  over the same period. Ackman has been notably linked to recent bullish bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. , which he exited in March after racking up a $4 billion loss on his investment. He is also notoriously wagering that nutritional-supplement company Herbalife Ltd.'s shares  will fall to zero. However, that company's stock is up 40% so far this year.

Valeant agrees to sell Obagi Medical Products for $190 million in cash
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  said Monday it has reached an agreement to sell its Obagi Medical Products business to Haitong International Zhonghua Finance Acquisition Fund I LP for $190 million in cash. Obagi is a specialty drug company that makes products aimed at premature skin aging, skin damage and other skin problems that are mostly available from dermatologists, plastic surgeons and medical spas. The deal is expected to close in the second half and proceeds will be used to repay term loan debt. Valeant said the company was expected to generate net profit of $85 million and non-GAAP EBITDA of $30 million. Valeant shares were slightly higher premarket, and have gained 19% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

Valeant redeems $500 million of debt, on track to meet or exceed $5 billion debt reduction goal 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  said Thursday it is redeeming the roughly $500 million of outstanding 6.75% notes that mature in 2018 using cash on hand, as it continues to work to reduce its debt burden. The troubled drug company, which has come through an accounting scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO, said it has now reduced its debt by more than $4.8 billion since the first quarter of 2016, and is on track to meet its goal of paying down $5 billion in debt within 18 months of August 2016. The company has no major debt maturities and no mandatory amortization requirements through 2019, giving it needed breathing room. "We are confident we will not only meet, but also exceed our debt reduction commitment early," Chief Executive Joseph Papa said in a statement. Valeant shares rose 1.7% premarket, and are now up 17% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Valeant pays down $811 million of term loans, shares rise
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. shares  jumped 1.2% in premarket trade Monday, after the company said it has paid down $811 million of senior secured loans, keeping it on track with its debt-reduction goals. The company said it used the proceeds of the recent sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC to pay off the loans. "With this transaction, all mandatory amortization has been paid through 2019," the company wrote in a statement. Valeant has reduced its debt by more than $4.3 billion since the end of the first quarter of 2016. The company, which started on a debt reduction track after an accounting scandal that battered its reputation and led to the ouster of its longtime chief executive, said it still expects to pay down $5 billion in debt using the proceeds of asset sales and free cash flow within 18 months of August 2016. Shares have gained 12% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.3%.

Valeant's stock surges after largest shareholder John Paulson elected to board
Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  surged 5% in premarket trade Monday, after the drug maker said billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson was elected to its board of directors. Paulson's hedge fund, Paulson & Co. Inc., is Valeant's largest shareholder with 19.4 million shares, or 5.6% of the shares outstanding as of the end of March, according to FactSet. "We are pleased to welcome John to Valeant's board of directors," said Valeant Chief Executive Joseph Papa. "With his significant business and financial expertise, John will be a strong addition to the board. His experience will be especially valuable as we continue to execute on our transformational strategy to turnaround Valeant." Earlier this year, hedge fund manager and large shareholder Bill Ackman had resigned from Valeant's board, and sold his 10% stake in the company amid mounting investment losses. The stock, on course to open at a four-month high, has tumbled 12.8% year to date through Friday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceutical ETF  has gained 5.6% and the S&P 500 [: spx] has climbed 8.7%.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

2011[edit]
In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million.[19] In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker Cephalon Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful.[20] In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO Eugene Melnyk was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the Ontario Securities Commission. In the year before the merger with Valeant, Melnyk had settled with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 after having previously paid $1 million to settle other claims with the SEC.[21] In July 2011, Valeant acquired Ortho Dermatologics from Janssen Pharmaceuticals for $345 million.

2014[edit]
In January 2014, Valeant acquired Solta Medical for approximately $250 million.[38] In May 2014, Nestle acquired the commercial rights to sell Valeant's filler and toxin products for $1.4 billion.[39] In July 2014, Valeant acquired PreCision Dermatology Inc for $475 million, a deal aimed at strengthening the firm’s skin products business.[40][41] Along with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant made a bid to acquire Allergan; however, in November 2014, Allergan announced that it would be acquired by Actavis in a $66 billion transaction.[42][43]
2015[edit]
On April 1, 2015, Valeant completed the purchase of gastrointestinal treatment drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion after outbidding Endo Pharmaceuticals.[44][45] On the final day of trading, Salix shares traded for $172.81, giving a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion. In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. Valeant develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. Valeant owns Bausch & Lomb, one of the largest manufacturers of contact lenses.
Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J. Michael Pearson and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a platform company that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Actavis and Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed.
In 2015–2016 the company was involved in a controversy about drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its specialty drugs. The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and Walgreens took over distribution.
Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Joseph C. Papa became CEO of the company in May 2016. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund held a major stake in the company before selling out in March 2017 for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.[2]

2011[edit]
In February 2011, Valeant acquired PharmaSwiss S.A. for €350 million.[19] In March 2011, an attempt to buy drugmaker Cephalon Inc. for $5.7 billion was unsuccessful.[20] In May 2011, former Biovail Corporation Chairman and CEO Eugene Melnyk was banned from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and penalized to pay $565,000 by the Ontario Securities Commission. In the year before the merger with Valeant, Melnyk had settled with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 after having previously paid $1 million to settle other claims with the SEC.[21] In July 2011, Valeant acquired Ortho Dermatologics from Janssen Pharmaceuticals for $345 million.

2014[edit]
In January 2014, Valeant acquired Solta Medical for approximately $250 million.[38] In May 2014, Nestle acquired the commercial rights to sell Valeant's filler and toxin products for $1.4 billion.[39] In July 2014, Valeant acquired PreCision Dermatology Inc for $475 million, a deal aimed at strengthening the firm’s skin products business.[40][41] Along with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Valeant made a bid to acquire Allergan; however, in November 2014, Allergan announced that it would be acquired by Actavis in a $66 billion transaction.[42][43]
2015[edit]
On April 1, 2015, Valeant completed the purchase of gastrointestinal treatment drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals for $14.5 billion after outbidding Endo Pharmaceuticals.[44][45] On the final day of trading, Salix shares traded for $172.81, giving a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion. In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Mercury (Cayman) Holdings, the holding company of Amoun Pharmaceutical, one of Egypts largest drugmakers, for $800 million.[46][47] In August 2015, Valeant said it would purchase Sprout Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1 billion, a day after Sprout received approval to market the women's libido drug Addyi.[48][49][50] In September 2015, Valeant licensed psoriasis drug Brodalumab from AstraZeneca for up to $445 million.[51][52] In September 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire eye surgery product manufacturer, Synergetics USA, for $192 million in order to strengthen the company's Bausch & Lomb division.[53][54] In October 2015, the company's Bausch & Lomb division acquired Doctor's Allergy Formula for an undisclosed sum.[55]
In 2015, Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, called the $3 billion in compensation received by J. Michael Pearson "excessive". [56]
2016[edit]
In February 2016, Valeant disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and by the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of New York.[57]
The company has been criticized for pioneering the highly lucrative business model of acquiring pharmaceutical companies or their drugs, incorporating these drugs into Valeant's sales and supply chain and then raising the prices of these medications to levels contemporaneous with similar pharmaceutical products.[58] From 2015 to 2016 Valeant shares plummeted 85 percent with stocks that were over $200 in 2015, now worth c. $36.[59][60] Large hedge funds such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Paulson & Company, Viking Global Investors and Brahman Capital lost billions in what has been described as hedge fund herding by Cornell University professor Andrew Karolyi.[60] In early 2015, hedge funds owned about 23 percent of Valeant shares. By April 2016, the market value of hedge fund holdings in Valeant had fallen by $7.3 billion.[60] However, hedge fund herding[61] continues to incite hedge fund portfolio manager's to continue to buy Valeant shares.[60] Between August 2015 and April 2016 Valeant's shares fell 80 per cent.[62] In their 2015 annual report filed on April 29, 2016 Valeant "Valeant said that it is the "subject of investigations" by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and New York, the state of Texas, the North Carolina Department of Justice, the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and the House’s Committee on Oversight and Reform, and has received document requests from the Autorite de Marches Financiers in Canada and the New Jersey State Bureau of Securities."[62] On April 27, 2016 Bill Ackman, J. Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Ageing to answer to concerns about the repercussions for patients and the health care system faced with Valeant's business model.[63]
In March 2016, the Board of Directors said that CEO J. Michael Pearson would be leaving the company as soon as a replacement CEO is found and that investor Bill Ackman would be added as a director.[64][65]
Although a deal was not reached, Valeant discussed selling Salix to Takeda for $10 billion in November 2016.[66] Valeant was also reportedly seeking to sell its eye surgery business for $2.5 billion.[67]
2017[edit]
In January 2017, the company announced the sale of skincare brands CeraVe, AcneFree and AMBI to L'Oréal for $1.3 billion.[68] Valeant also announced the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower for $819.9 million.[69] In early June, the company sold iNova Pharmaceuticals for $910 million, with Bausch & Lomb's eye surgery business also being potentially put up for sale for $2 billion.[70] In July, the company sold Obagi Medical Products for $190 million.[71]

Controversies[edit]
Ribavirin recall[edit]
On December 31, 2014 Valeant enacted a voluntary nationwide recall of Ribavirin after one lot of the drug was affected by microbial contamination.[72]
Business model of acquisitions and subsequent price increases[edit]
An important part of the growth strategy for Valeant has been acquisitions of medical and pharmaceutical companies and subsequent price increases for their products.[73] As a result of this strategy, smaller pharmaceutical companies refocused away from research and development towards serial acquisitions of existing technologies, more aggressive marketing and rapid price increases to enhance growth.[74] Valeant's strategy of exponential price increases on life-saving medicines has been described by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger as "deeply immoral" and "similar to the worst abuses in for-profit education."[75] This strategy has also attracted negative attention of regulators in the United States[74] particularly after the publication in the New York Times of an article by Andrew Pollack on price gouging of specialty drugs.[76][77][78][79][80][81]
2015 drug price inflation controversy[edit]
In September 2015, an influential group of politicians criticized Valeant on its pricing strategies.[79] The company raised prices on all its brand name drugs 66% in 2015, five times more than its closest industry peer. The cost of Valeant flucytosine is 10,000% higher in the United States than in Europe.[80][82] In late September 2015 members of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Committee to subpoena Valeant for their documents regarding the sharp increases in the price of "two heart medications it had just bought the rights to sell: Nitropress and Isuprel. Valeant raised the price of Nitropress 212% and Isuprel 525%".[78] Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.[83] New York Times columnist Joe Nocera claimed that Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson's "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".[84]
After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the diabetes pill Glumetza about 800%.[81][83]
Valeant’s heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel increased in price by over 210% and 520% each the day that Valeant acquired the rights to sell them.[85]
A New York Times article on October 4, 2015[83] stated that:

"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."
— New York Times October 4, 2015

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 Twitter post by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."[86] In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.[87]
By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."[88]
The House oversight committee requested documents from Valeant amid public concern around drug prices.[89][90]

Philidor[edit]
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by Andrew Left, a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.[91]
In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.[92]
Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."[93]
On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.[94]
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of Walgreens, took over distribution for Valeant.[95]
Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation[edit]
In October 2015, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.[96] On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.[97]

(NYSE: VRX and TSX: VRX) ("Valeant" or the "Company") today announced that certain affiliates of the Company have entered into an agreement to sell its Obagi Medical Products business for $190 million in cash to Haitong International Zhonghua Finance Acquisition Fund I, L.P. (the "Fund"). Limited partners of the Fund include industry veterans in other geographic markets, such as China Regenerative Medicine International Limited (8158.HK)."The sale of Obagi marks additional progress in our efforts to streamline our operations and reduce debt," Joseph C. Papa, chairman and CEO, Valeant. "As we continue to transform Valeant, we will remain focused on the core businesses that will drive high value for our shareholders."Obagi Medical Products is a global specialty pharmaceutical company founded by leading skin care experts in 1988. Obagi products are designed to help minimize the appearance of premature skin aging, skin damage, hyperpigmentation, acne and sun damage and are primarily available through dermatologists, plastic surgeons, medical spas and other skin care professionals. More information can be found at www.obagi.com.Valeant will use proceeds from the sale to permanently repay term loan debt under its Senior Secured Credit Facility. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.The Company currently estimates that the full-year 2017 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the Obagi business would have been approximately $85 million and $30 million, respectively.In this transaction, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as financial advisor to Valeant, and Norton Rose Fulbright acted as legal advisor to Valeant.China Regenerative Medicine International Limited (8158.HK) is engaged in the research, development and commercialization of innovative bio-medical, healthcare products and medical techniques. CRMI operates seven production plants in mainland China and Hong Kong, and the business is organized across four strategic areas, encompassing tissue engineering, cell therapy, cosmetics and hospital management. More information about China Regenerative Medicine International can be found at www.crmi.hk.About Valeant  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX:VRX) is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology and branded generics. More information about Valeant can be found at www.valeant.com.Forward-looking Statements  This press release may contain forward-looking statements which may generally be identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "should," "could," "would," "may," "will," "believes," "estimates," "potential," "target," or "continue" and variations or similar expressions. These statements are based upon the current expectations and beliefs of management and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's most recent annual or quarterly report and detailed from time to time in Valeant's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators, which factors are incorporated herein by reference. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Valeant undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect actual outcomes, unless required by law. In addition, the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) amounts set out above are based on the current expectations and beliefs of management, which management believes are reasonable in the circumstances, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties, including those described above. These amounts have been included to provide information relating to the anticipated impact of the sale of the Obagi business on those measures for the Company as a whole, and they may not be appropriate for any other purpose.Read MoreNon-GAAP Information  To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has presented Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in this press release. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring and/or unusual items. We cannot predict the amount of such non-recurring or unusual items at this time. The Company does not provide reconciliations of projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to projected GAAP net income (loss) (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA both to assess the current financial performance of the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) focuses management on the Company's underlying operational results and business performance. In addition, cash bonuses for the Company's executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) targets.The Company believes non-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company. However, these measures do not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.   Investor Contacts:       Arthur Shannon      Elif McDonald     arthur.shannon@valeant.com      elif.mcdonald@valeant.com      514-856-3855        514-856-3855      877-281-6642 (toll free)      877-281-6642 (toll free)         Media Contact:      Lainie Keller      lainie.keller@valeant.com      908-927-0617    Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

(NYSE: VRX and TSX: VRX) ("Valeant") and EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EYEG) ("EyeGate"), a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing products for treating diseases and disorders of the eye, today announced that they have entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement through which EyeGate has granted a subsidiary of Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to the EyeGate® II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product candidate for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation in ocular surgery patients.This partnership follows a 2015 agreement in which Valeant secured an exclusive worldwide license for its subsidiary to this product for uveitis. Valeant has maintained its right of last negotiation to license the product for other indications."We are pleased to extend our relationship with EyeGate, and to obtain the global commercial and manufacturing rights to the EyeGate II Delivery System for the indication of post-operative inflammation and pain in ocular surgery patients. We believe that the product has significant potential in the market as part of our Bausch + Lomb business and applaud EyeGate for a remarkable job in advancing the product's development in both uveitis and cataract surgery," said Joseph C. Papa , Chairman and CEO of Valeant. "We look forward to further supporting EyeGate as they continue their progress in bringing this product to market to meet the needs of our customers and their patients.""This second licensing agreement with Valeant provides an important validation of both the clinical and commercial potential of iontophoretic EGP-437 . We believe that Bausch + Lomb's sales, marketing and commercial capabilities in ophthalmology are unrivalled, making them the optimal partner to bring this unique product to market," said Stephen From , President and Chief Executive Officer of EyeGate. "For the approximately 3 million cataract surgery patients in the U.S. each year, adherence to the post-operative therapeutic regimen is imperative. As many of these patients are older and may struggle with self-administration of corticosteroid eye drops, we believe that iontophoretic EGP-437 administered by the eye care practitioner will provide a promising new treatment in addressing the needs of this large patient population."Under the license agreement, EyeGate received an upfront cash payment and has the potential to receive certain development-based milestone payments, as well as additional milestone payments based on the achievement of certain cumulative and annual sales milestones. Additionally, EyeGate will receive royalties on Valeant's net sales of the product.EyeGate will be responsible for the continued development of the EyeGate II delivery system in the U.S. for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation in ocular surgery patients, and all associated costs. Valeant has the right to further develop the product outside of the U.S., at its cost.

Better Buy: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. vs. Gilead Sciences
Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences both look dirt cheap, but only one of these stocks is a real bargain.











                George Budwell
            

                (TMFGBudwell)



            
            Jul 21, 2017 at 6:00AM
            
            





When it comes to the high-flying healthcare sector, there aren't many bargains to be had. President Trump's recent change of heart regarding the possibility of hard caps on high-priced prescription drugs, after all, sparked a widespread rally that's caused valuations to balloon over the past month or so. 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (NYSE:VRX) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), however, are two high-profile names that are still arguably "cheap" -- at least based on their rock-bottom price-to-sales ratios of 0.63 and 3.22, respectively. Armed with this insight, let's consider which of these two bargain-bin healthcare stocks is the better buy right now.

Valeant: Digging its way out of a deep hole
Valeant's super-aggressive growth-by-acquisition strategy proved to be its undoing when the company's pricing practices drew the ire of regulators and politicians alike. The net result is a company with a staggering amount of leverage on its balance sheet -- illustrated by its jaw-dropping debt-to-equity ratio of 714%, a falling EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and a share price that's now well off its five-year highs. 
On the bright side, Valeant's fairly new CEO Joseph Papa has begun the herculean task of righting the ship, so to speak. Since taking the reigns, Papa has focused heavily on reducing the company's monstrous debt load and improving its financial flexibility. The company has now divested multiple non-core assets, such as its Dendreon business and, most recently, its skin-care subsidiary Obagi Medical Products, to achieve Papa's stated goal of reducing debt by $5 billion by early 2019.
Unfortunately, Valeant's debt problem is so bad that even $5 billion won't be enough to markedly improve the company's balance sheet. More has to be done to move the needle on this critical risk factor, and that's where Valeant's enticing value proposition seems to come off the rails.
Long story short, Valeant simply doesn't have enough organic growth coming down the pike to avoid the divestiture of a core asset that would radically alter its value proposition to investors. Its newly approved psoriasis drug, Siliq, for instance, is facing a bevy of competitive threats that could very well keep it from making much headway in the high-value anti-inflammatory market. That's a serious problem, as Siliq was expected to be a key growth product for the company heading into next year and beyond.  
In the final analysis, Valeant doesn't appear to have much choice but to cut bait with a significant asset within the next two years, and that could include its all-important Bausch & Lomb business segment. 
Gilead: Where's the growth?
Gilead has been in biotech purgatory for awhile now due to the company's reluctance to address its faltering hepatitis C franchise with a bolt-on acquisition. The company's quarterly revenues, after all, have been in steep decline for a solid year-and-a-half as a result of higher competition and pushback from payers. Worse still, this negative trend is only expected to accelerate as more potent competitors enter the market -- such as AbbVie's glecaprevir/pibrentasvir combo therapy that's presently under review with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Gilead, for its part, has actively championed its considerable pipeline efforts in anti-inflammatory conditions, non-hep C liver diseases, cancer, and of course, HIV, as reasons to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects moving forward. At the end of the day, though, these ongoing clinical programs aren't expected to bear fruit anytime soon, with one notable exception: Gilead's next-gen HIV combo medicine bictegravir/F/TAF, which is forecast to become a top-selling drug by 2022.
Point blank: The acquisition of a revenue-generating peer is essential to Gilead's near-term growth prospects. The company shouldn't have any problem going this route, given that it exited the most recent quarter with $34 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Even so, Gilead hasn't shown any outward signs that it's gearing up for a major acquisition soon. Complicating matters further, the ongoing rally among pharma stocks may make a buyout even less attractive to the biotech's rather conservative management team.  





Which stock is the better buy?
Gilead wins this matchup by default. Valeant, after all, is a mess that's going to require CEO Joseph Papa perhaps a decade, or even longer, to clean up. Gilead, by contrast, still has tremendous free cash flows, a growing dividend program, and the financial flexibility to take out nearly any size target it desires if a compelling opportunity presents itself.


George Budwell has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Gilead Sciences and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The Motley Fool has the following options: short August 2017 $75 calls on Gilead Sciences. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.
