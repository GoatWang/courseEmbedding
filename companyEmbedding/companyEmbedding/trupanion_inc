Strange: Bullish TRUP Analysts Actually See -14.36% Downside

TRUP Crosses Above Average Analyst Target
In recent trading, shares of Trupanion Inc have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $17.00, changing hands for $17.97/share.

Trupanion is Now Oversold (TRUP)
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.

            Certificate FAQs
        

            We created our certificates so you can experience for yourself the benefits of pet insurance. Want the lowdown on certificates? We answered some of the most frequently asked questions.
        





Is my pet eligible to use the certificate?
All dogs and cats between 8 weeks and before their 14th birthday are eligible for lifelong coverage. To use a certificate from a veterinarian, your pet just needs to have received an exam within 24 hours.





Can I activate the certificate at any time?
No, certificates must be activated within a specific window of time. Please reference your certificate or give us a call to learn more about this timeframe.





What is covered?
Certificates provide the full benefits of the comprehensive Trupanion policy - 90% coverage for the cost to treat new injuries and illnesses, including hereditary and congenital treatments, with no payout limits. That means that you're covered for all of this and more for eligible conditions.

Diagnostic tests
Surgeries
Medications

Hospital stays
Supplements
And much more






What is not covered?
We never want to surprise you with any hidden exclusions or limits. The Trupanion policy does not cover:

Routine preventative care
Exam fees
Sales tax (where applicable)
Pre-existing conditions






What are pre-existing conditions?
Pre-existing conditions are conditions that show symptoms before coverage begins. And while the Trupanion policy covers all new injuries and illnesses, like all pet insurance policies, it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.








Terms and conditions apply. See the policy for details.

Trupanion offers more than traditional pet insurance
Trupanion was created to help your four-legged family members get the care they need when they’re sick or injured. When your pet is unwell, the last thing you want to think about is the cost of medical care.

Our love of cats and dogs is why we provide comprehensive coverage for pets and strive to offer an exceptional insurance experience for pet owners. We can approve and pay bills directly to select veterinary hospitals within minutes, our customer care team is available to assist 24/7, and we have trained veterinary professionals working throughout our company to help us better understand the medical issues pets face.

You're only responsible for the routine and preventive care, the costs you expect to pay as a dog owner.

What is dog insurance?
When your dog gets sick or hurt, the last thing you want to think about is how much the veterinary care will cost. The best dog health insurance helps protect you from that financial burden and makes sure you can focus on getting the best care possible. Whether your dog encounters a minor incident, like an unfortunate meeting with a porcupine or a stumble down the stairs, or develops a serious medical condition like hip dysplasia or cancer, the Trupanion policy is there to cover 90% of all eligible healthcare expenses.
In a world of advanced veterinary care, the best coverage gives you the financial ability to care for your family member, and we can do that.







How does dog insurance work?
Dog health insurance is simple with Trupanion. You pay a monthly premium in order to be covered for any unexpected illnesses or injuries throughout your dog’s life. 








If your dog is under the weather take them to any veterinarian, specialty center, or emergency hospital in the US, Canada, or Puerto Rico and get them the treatment they need.






Rest assured knowing Trupanion has your back. When you file a claim, we’ll cover 90% of eligible healthcare expenses for your dog. You are responsible for any non-eligible expenses, your deductible, and the remaining 10%.





When it comes to the unexpected, we’ll be there for life. You’re only responsible for the routine and preventive care—the costs you expect to pay as a dog owner.






 The Trupanion policy has no payout limits per condition, per year, or for the lifetime of your dog. If you have an unlucky dog that has a lifetime of serious health conditions or ongoing care, you will never see a cap on how much we pay for your claims.

What does dog medical insurance cover?
Simply put, we provide one simple plan that covers 90% of your unexpected veterinary costs. This includes hospital stays, diagnostic tests, medications, surgeries, and other
treatments that arise when your canine friend is sick or hurt.* The 90% coverage kicks in after you meet your deductible, and there are no limits on the amount we reimburse.


Basically, almost every type of injury or illness is eligible for coverage, so long as it is not considered pre-existing. We do not exclude any conditions or breed-specific ailments. We even cover hereditary and congenital conditions, provided signs were not evident before your enrollment date.
That means if your dog pulls a muscle, develops allergies, or is diagnosed with hip dysplasia or lymphoma, we’ll be there. Tears a CCL? We’ll cover it. Arthritis? We’ve got it covered. Eats chocolate? We’ve covered it before and we’ll do it again.  Hit by a car? We’re there for you.









What's covered


Illnesses & injuries
    
Hereditary & congenital conditions
Diagnostic tests
Surgeries
Hospital stays
Medications
Veterinary supplements
Prosthetic devices & carts



Waiting periods
Coverage is applicable to new injuries or illnesses that occur after waiting periods.














What's not covered


Exam fees
Sales tax where applicable
Wellness & preventive care
Pre-existing conditions (an illness or condition which occurred or showed symptoms prior to your pet's coverage effective date)



Extra coverage

The Trupanion policy also offers optional packages for additional coverage that may fit your lifestyle. These packages can protect you from other unforeseen events or circumstances related to your dog, provide extra coverage for alternative and rehabilitative therapies, and add extra protection for breeding dogs. They come at an additional cost.

How much does dog insurance cost?
Each dog is unique, from their size to their energy level and tendencies, which is why our prices are unique to your dog's situation. The cost of dog insurance varies based on several factors specific to your dog, including:






You can see your personalized price now with a quick quote for your dog.



 Pick my price 




You can customize your monthly price by changing your deductible
Once you get a quote, choose your dog's monthly premium by selecting a deductible from $0 to $1,000. This is the amount you’ll be responsible for before your coverage starts.
This gives you the flexibility to set a monthly premium that fits your budget. Plus, you can change your deductible at any time simply by giving us a call.
What might cause my premium to change?
Over the life of your dog, you may see periodic adjustments to your dog's premium, which may be an increase, a decrease, or no change at all. Premium changes are due to the
average cost of dogs similar to yours based on our claims experiences and inflation. 

You will never see an automatic increase to your premium as a result of filing a claim. We know that you have no control over whether your canine friend gets sick or injured, which is why we don't penalize  a policyholder with increased premiums solely because their dog filed a claim
 ^Back to top








When should I get health insurance for my dog?
The best time to think about insurance for your dog is when they are a puppy or young adult. Every dog is prone to certain types of illnesses and injuries in each stage of life so it’s important to be prepared every step of the way.

TIP: No dog insurance provider offers coverage for pre-existing conditions. By
insuring your dog when they are young or when you first bring them home, you can
get them covered before you find any signs of pre-existing conditions and get the
most out of your Trupanion policy.

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating.

For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory.

Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price.
