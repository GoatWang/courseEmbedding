Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Infinity Pharmaceuticals Conference Call to discuss the Company’s Financial Results for the Full Year 2016. My name is Amanda, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session to follow. Please be advised that this call is being recorded at Infinity’s request.
At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today’s call, Ms. Jaren Madden, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Infinity. Please go ahead.
Jaren Madden
Thanks, Amanda, and good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome to today’s call to discuss our recent business progress and review our fourth quarter 2016 and full year financial results. With me here today are Adelene Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Kutok, Chief Scientific Officer; Claudio Dansky Ullmann, Senior Vice President, Clinical Development; Dr. Joe Pearlberg, the Medical Lead for our IPI-549 program; and Larry Bloch, President. Following our remarks, we’ll open up the call for Q&A.
The press release issued earlier today details our results and is available on our website at infi.com. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future expectations and plans, including clinical development objectives, the therapeutic potential of our product candidates, our strategic plans and strategies and financial projections.
Our actual results may differ materially from what we project today due to a number of important factors including the considerations described in the risk factor section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the full year 2016 and in other filings we may make with SEC. These forward-looking statements represent our views as if only today. We caution you that may not update them in the future whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Adelene.
Adelene Perkins
Thanks, Jaren. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call, particularly those of you who are battling today’s northeastern blizzard.
We’re particularly pleased with the progress we’re making with IPI-549, the first and only selective PI3-kinase gamma inhibitor in clinical development. Our Phase 1 study in patients with advanced solid tumors is enrolling ahead of schedule. We’re maintaining strong fiscal discipline and we have an experienced team in place that’s executing with the great sense of urgency to deliver meaningful data within our two-year cash runway. [Ph] Today, we’ll review our progress in advancing IPI-549 and also review our full year 2016 financial results.
We had a number of key accomplishments last year that position us to make important progress this year. Last November, our preclinical data, which established the objective for our ongoing clinical study were reported in back-to-back publications in Nature. We also entered a clinical trial collaboration with BMS for the supply of Opdivo, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor for the combination component of our study, which we initiated in December. Enrollment in this first combination cohort was completed in January and we are well on our way to completing enrollment in the second combination cohort.
We’re excited about IPI-549 because it represents a unique immuno-oncology approach by reprogramming macrophages within the tumor microenvironment, converting them from a pro-tumor to an anti-tumor phenotype. Our preclinical data which we’ll review momentarily, provides compelling rationale for our Phase 1 study and underscores the potential for IPI-549 to serve as the backbone for a wide spectrum of combination therapies for the treatment of solid tumors.

The Phase 1 study is evaluating IPI-549 both as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo in a broad range of patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety profile of IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor. We’re very encouraged by the tolerability of IPI-549 at doses that provide near complete suppression of PI3-kinase gamma as no patients have discontinued treatment due to drug related side effects to-date.
The chronic dose escalation phase of the study evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination is very important because it enables us to learn about the safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics profile of IPI-549 and determine optimal doses to evaluate in our expansion cohort. Through this expansion cohort, we will generate additional data from monotherapy treatment and also from combination of IPI-549 and Opdivo in specific types of solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer.
We had the honor of presenting our preclinical and early clinical data in peer reviewed forum that enable us to share our findings and exceed [ph] that from highly regarded scientists and clients. Less than two months ago, at the plenary session of the PI3-kinase Keystone Symposia, we presented a summary of our recent publication in nature along with the Phase 1 data from the first nine patients, previously presented at the AACR triple meeting in New York, last September.
Additionally, an update of the Phase 1 monotherapy data were presented in a plenary session at the International Congress on Targeted Anticancer Therapies or TAT last week. And we’re looking forward to sharing updated data from ongoing monotherapy module, as well as an initial data from this combination dose-escalation module at the AACR annual meeting next month.
 These data will be reviewed during both an oral education session on Saturday April, 1st and in a poster session on Tuesday, April 4th. We are also focusing an event for the investment community on Saturday evening April 1st, during which time, study investigators will be available to speak about their experience treating patients with IPI-549.
As we look ahead, we expect to make progress in following three key areas this year. First, we will complete our monotherapy and combination dose-escalation module. We anticipate completing the monotherapy dose-escalation in the first half of the year and the combination dose-escalation in the second half of the year. Second, we will begin enrolling patients in both the monotherapy and combination expansion cohort in the second half of 2017. And third, we will report updated Phase 1 data throughout the year, first, at the AACR annual meeting next month and then in a peer reviewed forum in the second half of 2017.
Before we provide a more detailed review of IPI-549, I’d like to highlight the promotion of two key people to our executive leadership team. Claudio Dansky Ullmann, our Senior Vice President of Clinical Development; and Jeff Kutok, our Chief Scientific Officer. Claudio has led our Clinical Development team since joining the Company in 2015. He has more than 30 years experience in developing medicine at Takeda, as well as at the National Cancer Institute. During this time, Claudio participated in and led numerous early-phase and late-phase clinical trials including studies evaluating treatments for lung and head and neck cancers, melanoma and other solid tumors. His extensive work at the NCI focused on immuno-oncology and drug resistance.
Jeff Kutok has played an instrumental role in overseeing our biology and translational science efforts since joining Infinity in 2010, including leading the Infinity team that advanced IPI-549 platform in the clinical development and co-authored our recent back-to-back publications in Nature on PI3-kinase-gamma and IPI-549. His experience in translational research and in the medical pathologist, at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital is a perfect complement to our clinical team.

And with these introductions, I’m going to turn the call over to Jeff to summarize our preclinical data followed by Claudio, who will review our clinical study. It’s been pleasure to work with Jeff and Claudio, and we look forward to their continued contributions in advancing IPI-549.
Jeff Kutok
Thanks, Adelene, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our discovery of IPI-549 provides us the unique and exciting opportunity to be the first to explore the potential therapeutic benefit of this highly selective PI3K- gamma inhibitor.
Through research collaborations with colleagues at the University of California, San Diego and Memorial Sloan Kettering, we’ve learned that PI3K-gamma is highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and that the blockade of PI3K-gamma signaling by treatment with IPI-549 results in reprogramming macrophages. This reprogramming shifts macrophages in the tumor microenvironment from the M2 or pro-tumor phenotype to the M1 or anti-tumor phenotype and increases the number of T-cells that attack the tumor and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
In terms of activity observed pre-clinically, we’ve demonstrated dose dependant single agent anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor models including models of lung cancer, melanoma head and neck cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer. Additionally, in preclinical models, treatment with IPI-549 in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor showed a greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival rates including a greater number of complete tumor regressions when compared to treatments with either IPI-549 or the checkpoint inhibitor alone. The combination treatment is often a long-lasting anti-tumor immune memory as evidenced by the lack of tumor growth upon re-challenge with the same tumor in the absence of any treatment.
While it’s encouraging to observe the synergistic activity of IPI-549 with checkpoint inhibition, resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy represents another challenge. Our preclinical data demonstrates that increased pro-tumor M2 macrophages are associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibitor monothreapy, and treatment with IPI-549 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors is be able to overcome this resistance by reprogramming macrophages from the M2 pro-tumor phenotype to the M1 anti-tumor phenotype.
The key takeaways from our preclinical findings are as follows. First, inhibition of PI3K-gamma plays a key role in reprogramming tumor associated microphages. Second, we’ve demonstrated monotherapy and combination activity of IPI-549 in multiple preclinical models of cancer. And third, we’ve shown that treatment with IPI-549 can overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition. This collected value research represents important contributions to the field of immuno-oncology. On April 1st, I will review our IPI-549 program during an oral educational session at the AACR Annual Meeting. It is an honor to be invited to share our innovative chemistry, preclinical research and clinical data in this forum, and I hope to see many of you there. Our preclinical discoveries provide the foundation for our ongoing clinical study Phase 1 of IPI-549, which I will now turn to Claudio to review in more details. 
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Thank you, Jeff.
I’m really pleased to update you on our progress with IPI-549. There is a growing need for treatment options for patients who do not respond to current immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors. Even when there is an initial response to checkpoint blockade, resistance often subsequently develops. Given our preclinical data demonstrated that IPI-549 can overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade, I’m very excited about where we stand today and what we could accomplish in the future. While it’s still early days, I want to share with you a few reasons I believe in the therapeutic potential of IPI-549, why our investigators have been so supportive and why our study has been progressing ahead of schedule.

First, IPI-549 is the first and only selective PI3-kinase-gamma inhibitor in the clinic. The unique mechanism of action or reprogramming macrophages to create a more favorable tumor like environment and facilitate an anti-tumor immune response makes IPI-549 a great partner for combination with today’s immunotherapies. Second, the preclinical data supporting this first in class therapy provides a compelling rationale for our ongoing Phase 1 study. Third, as once daily oral therapy, IPI-549 is easy to administer. And fourth, the safety profile to-date is excellent and no patients have discontinued treatment due to drug related adverse events. This Phase 1 study is designed to determine the safety, recommended Phase 2 dose, and activity of IPI-549 in approximately 135 patients. The study includes four distinct modules, which I will now review.
The first module is a monotherapy dose-escalation phase in patients with advanced solid tumors. This first module allows us to define the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic of IPI-549 as we’re determining [ph] a recommended single agent Phase 2 dose. We have completed patient enrollment in five dose-escalation cohorts evaluating once daily doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 milligrams to 40 milligrams. We’re extremely pleased with the safety, PK and PD data observed to-date. We near [ph] complete suppression of PI3-kinase-gamma, no serious drug related side effects have been observed, no dose limiting toxicities have been reported, no patients have been continue to treatment due to drug related side effects and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. This monotherapy safety data represents a significant de-risking for our product.
Based on our PK and PD data which showed significant suppression of PI3-kinase-gamma at 20 milligrams once daily, we felt confident in initiating the second module of our study early last December. The goal of the second dose-escalation module is to demonstrate that IPI-549 on Opdivo can be safely combined and to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose of this combination. We initiated the first combination cohort of 20 milligrams IPI-549 plus the standard regimen of Opdivo. We completed the enrollment in the first combination cohort in January and have already enrolled the majority of patients in our second cohort, evaluating 30 milligrams IPI-549 with Opdivo.
Demonstrating the safety of this combination represents a key derisking event for the product and will enable us to more formally test the efficacy of this combination in the disease specific expansion cohorts.
Our monotherapy and combination expansion cohorts represent the third and the fourth modules of our study. Module three, our monotherapy expansion cohort, provides an opportunity to generate more simulation data in a greater number of patients with a variety of solid tumors -- advanced solid tumors. Since this is an [indiscernible] cohort, we also have the opportunity to learn about all additional potential indications for IPI-549. The fourth module will evaluate IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo in patients with specific types of cancer including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In addition, the enrollment to the disease specific cohort we serve for patients that have demonstrated initial resistance or those initial responded but subsequently t developed resistance to checkpoint therapy. This fourth module is a direct test of whether IPI-549 can overcome checkpoint resistance as demonstrated in preclinical models and translation. [Ph] Translational research will be critical to helping us better understand how IPI-549 works in patients and within current future studies. To that end, I want to emphasize that pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies are mandatory for all expansion cohorts so that we can better understand the tumor [indiscernible] patients who respond and identify biomarkers of response and resistance.

We are pleased to share the initial data from our monotherapy in combination dose escalation modules at the AACR Annual Meeting next month. As Jeff mentioned, he will review our IPI-549 program during an oral educational session on Saturday April 1st, which will include an overview of our clinical program. Then, we will provide a more detailed review of our clinical data during the poster session on Tuesday April 4th. While our abstract is [indiscernible] until March 31st, we can tell you that we are planning to provide an update on 15 patients in module one, our monotherapy dose escalation as well as at least six patients in module two, our combination dose escalation. The presentation will be focused on safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. I look forward to seeing many of you at AACR and to sharing additional clinical updates with you at medical meetings in the second half of 2017.
Now, Larry will review our 2016 financial results.
Larry Bloch
Thank you, Claudio.
What you’ve heard from the Infinity team is a great deal of enthusiasm for IPI-549, which is really compelling science, the excitement of advancing potential first-in-class oral therapy, and the tremendous support of our investigators. We expect the data for 2017 and have the financial resources to complete all core modules of our clinical study within our current cash runway which extends into the first quarter of 2019.
I’ll now summarize our financial results for the full year 2016.
Revenue during 2016 was $18.7 million and was related to our previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie duvelisib. Revenue during 2015 was $109.1 million, all of which related to the AbbVie collaboration. In 2016, we also recorded a non-recurring gain on AbbVie’s opt-out of duvelisib collaboration of $112.2 million. This non-recurring gain represents the remaining deferred revenue of $112.2 million as of June 24, 2016 from the previous collaboration with AbbVie for duvelisib. The AbbVie opt-out is irrevocable and we have no further obligations to continue to provide AbbVie with any services. Additionally, we did not recorded any gains during 2015.
R&D expense for 2016 of $119.6 million compared to $199.1 million for 2015. The decrease in R&D expense year-over-year was primarily related to a 2015 exercise option payment to Takeda, our restructuring activities and the reduction in clinical development expenses for duvelisib.
General and administrative expense was $42.2 million for 2016 compared to $37.1 million for 2015. The year-over-year increase in G&A expense is primarily due to restructuring activities. Net loss for 2016 was $30.1 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.61, compared to net loss of $128.4 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $2.62 for the same period of 2015.
At December 31, 2016, we had total cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of $92.1 million compared to $245.2 million at December 31, 2015 and wondering $112.3 million at September 30, 2016. I’ll also review the 2017 financial guidance that we provided in January and it remains unchanged.
We expect net loss for 2017 to range from $40 million to $50 million. And we expect to end 2017 with a year-end cash and investment balance ranging from $40 million to $50 million. Based on current operating plans, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2016 will provide cash runway into the first quarter of 2019. Our cash runway expectations exclude additional funding or business development activities. We are off to a very strong start in 2017 and expect to make continued progress in our Phase 1 study throughout the year. We look forward to providing updated data from our clinical study next month at AACR, as well as additional data updates throughout the year as we pursue our goal of bringing considerable benefit to patients.

We hope to see many of you at AACR meeting in just a few weeks. And now, we are happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Anupam Rama from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
UnidentifiedAnalyst
Hey, guys. This is Eric in for Anupam this afternoon. I hope you guys are staying warm and dry. Thanks for taking the question. Claudio, you noted expectations of presenting data from six patients from the Opdivo combination at AACR. Is that inclusive patients who would be available to read this responses in addition to initial safety PK/PD? And I have follow-up.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Yes. So, as you recognize, the key focus on the dose-escalation as we explore the combination is safety, because that’s the key issue that we’re going to be able to say that it’s -- we have a valuable combination to move forward. Obviously, we’re going to look into particular signals, depending on what type of patients we get, and what they have been -- the prior exposure to checkpoint inhibitors in that particular cohort, and also usual responders or not, or expected to respond or not to checkpoint. So, we may be looking at that type of activity. But, I think, we should emphasize that that should not be the focus in terms of the dose-escalation and that it should be mainly efficacy. Hopefully, we will have at least a very -- or stronger readout, once we move forward with the expansion cohorts in very defined tumor types.
Adelene Perkins
Eric, in the dose escalation, it’s all comers, so that we don’t have the homogeneity of patients in the tumor type, though have progress on the PD-1 at the recommended Phase 2 dose. So as Claudio outlined, the modules one and two are really about safety and three and four get to efficacy.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. I guess sort of with the initial focus here still being around dosing, short of reaching and MTD, what measures are you looking to kind of establish or solidify a biologically affected dose with 549 both as monotherapy but also in combating with Opdivo? Thanks. 
Adelene Perkins
So, Joe Pearlberg is going to take that question. 
Dr. Joe Pearlberg
Thanks, Adelene. So, short of an MTD for both the monotherapy as well as the combination dose escalation arms of the study, we’re going to really look at the totality of all the data, which will include safety, tolerability, the PK and PD data to make a decision for each of those respective cohorts with respect to recommended Phase 2 dose.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu from William Blair. Your line is open.
Katherine Xu
Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I’m just wondering what is the expected toxicity of 549 and does that include potential [ph] or any other?
Adelene Perkins
Yes. So, Katherine, we’ll just remind you that to date we haven’t seen any side effects, and that will be discussed in more detail in the upcoming AACR presentation. But Joe can share with you what was presented at the last AACR meeting in September on that.
Dr. Joe Pearlberg
Yes. Thank you, Adelene. So at the presentation in September of 2016, we presented data on nine patients. And what reported at that time, there were no drug related SAEs, there were no DLPs. And most of the adverse events have been low grade that is grade one, grade two. And in fact going back to even further, the preclinical data package really did not suggest anything concerning in terms of toxicity. And since this is a first-in-class compound, IPI-549 in targeting the gamma isoform in PI3K is distinct, it’s unique from the other isoforms. We are very well aware of the side-effect profile that’s associated with inhibiting the delta isoform of PI3K. We’re also aware of the side effect profile of inhibiting the alpha isoform of PI3K, and I’ll also add our investigators are really well experienced in the field of immuno-oncology. And we are very keen with regard to the expected toxicity of the immuno-therapeutic agents. And we’re going to present a complete safety profile of IPI-549 in a couple of weeks at the AACR meeting which we look forward to?

Katherine Xu
Great. And then, from the preclinical data or the data that you’ve seen so far in the clinic, can you see 549 could convert PDL negative tumors to the positive, towards that direction? And also, when you talk about overcoming resistance anti PD-1, can you -- are there any characterization of those resistance? For example is this reverse refractory? Are there any expectations on those and then are there any differential activities, against a potential different phenotypes that we look for?
Adelene Perkins
Jeff can take that one.
Jeff Kutok
Yes. This is Jeff. Let me start by answering your second question with respect to the overcoming of resistance in our preclinical models. The models that we looked at that were resistant to checkpoint inhibition had a very unique phenotype. And it was that they were very rich in M2 tumor associated macrophages. And we showed that that there was a differential sensitivity between sensitive and insensitive tumors depending on the level of the M2 macrophages. And we subsequently showed that in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, IPI-549 was able to effectively reverse the M2 to M1 ratio and subsequently activated an anti-tumor T-cell response. So, the preclinical data points to a myeloid rich tumor which would potentially be insensitive to checkpoint inhibition. So, this is something that. as Claudio alluded to, we’re going to be actively pursuing it in the clinic and answer to whether 549 can reverse this resistance. And your first question, could you repeat it for me, please?
Katherine Xu
To convert PDL that gets to PDL positive?
Jeff Kutok
Yes. So, it’s an interesting question to often -- the response of a tumor to increasing PDL-1 is mediated through interferon gamma responses. It’s an adaptive resistance sort of concept on the two parts [ph] put forward. And we have shown that there is an increase in gamma interferon reduction pre-clinically with 549 treatment and we have shown that there is an increase in PDL expression in the tumors in our preclinical study. So, it’s possible that in the clinic, we will increase the PDL-1 levels on tumors with 549 treatment.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. This is Patrick for Mike King. I just have some quick questions regarding upcoming data. So, what data point should investors be most watching for and how should investors think about the success of 549? Thank you.
Adelene Perkins
So, the most important data in the first module, the dose escalation of our Phase 1 study is the tolerability and determining the recommended Phase 2 dose to take into the expansion cohort, as well as be able to look for efficacy, particularly in the combination with Opdivo, more homogeneous patient population. And those cohorts will begin in the second half of this year.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
And to add to that, we’re going to present the pharmacodynamic data that is clearly showing how at least in the issues we are mentioning, how we’re achieving meaningful suppressive concentrations of our target. So, I think that’s very relevant as we move forward.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Also about duvelisib, I know it’s licensed to Verastem, but maybe you can remind us how the trial is set up for superiority to ofatumumab and what is milestone payment associated with it? Thank you.
Adelene Perkins
Sure, Patrick. So, the DUO trial, which is evaluating duvelisib versus ofatumumab has a PFS endpoint. And that trial is now being run by Verastem. If the trial is successful, they will owe us a $6 million milestone. And then, subsequently if the file and have an NDA accepted, a $22 million milestone.
Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Yanan [ph] in for Jim. So first of all, for the AACR data presentation, I’m wondering if we are going to see data for the biomarker for M1, M2 conversions from tumor biopsies.
Adelene Perkins
So, I would just turn it over Claudio to answer. I’ll just remind you that we’re not collecting the biopsies until we get to the expansion cohort phase.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Yes. So, to complement that. So, basically the answer is no, because we’re not mandating biopsies at this point, either for monotherapy dose escalation or for the combination dose escalation. So, we will not have that data to present.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, thanks. And you mentioned that you have achieved a near complete inhibition of PI3K-gamma. Have you talked about at which -- what dose level that occurred?
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Yes, I can comment and then Joe can complement. So, we’ve been -- as we move forward in the different dose escalation, we’ve been doing almost as much as possible real-time assessment. So, as we said in our initial remarks, we already see meaningful suppression at 20 milligrams in the monotherapy dose escalation. And then, we are obviously following the same story for 30 milligrams and we’re waiting for 40 milligrams data. But basically, we can say confidently that we’re achieving good levels of suppression even at 20 milligrams.
Now, as Joe was referring earlier, once we have the complete dataset of all the dose escalation cohorts, we will look at the totality of the data and see how that perform in the interest of stability in the suppression.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, last two quick questions. One is, you mentioned enrollment was ahead of schedule. Could you talk about whether that’s true for both the monotherapy portion in addition to the combination portion; also have you gotten certain KOL feedback after you presented the data at TAT? Thanks.
Dr. Joe Pearlberg
I’ll answer the first part of the question. And the answer is yes, for both the monotherapy and combination dose escalation arms, enrollments is ahead of schedule. And now, I’ll turn to Claudio with regard to the investigator feedback from the TAT conference.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
So, at TAT one of our -- the main enroller actually, Tony Tolcher data in the oral session and also Jedd Wolchok presented some of the rationale in his award lecture. And we had very positive feedback from investigators in relation to what they saw in terms of the data, where we’re with the program and the potential directions where the program could go as we move forward. Is that the question you’re asking?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes.
Adelene Perkins
And then I think both the enthusiasm from TAT and to Joe’s response about enrolling ahead of schedule, it’s we believe due to some of the reasons, Claudio mentioned earlier that it’s an easy to administer oral drug, it’s been well-tolerated for any who are interested in this whole M2 to M1 reprogramming we have -- it’s the PI3-kinase-gamma inhibitor in development and for patients who progress on the checkpoint inhibitor, there are few options. So we think there are a lot of sustainable reasons why that’s true for both the monotherapy arm and the combination arm of the trial.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
And also as measure for you regarding enrollment, as you recognize with all the competition from different trials and different combinations, the fact that we opened the enrollment for the combination cohort kind of in mid-December, we were -- we completed enrollment of the six patients by the first half of January this year. So, I think that speaks to the robustness or strong support that we get from investigators about our trial.

Operator
Thank you. And at this time, I’m showing no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Adelene for closing remarks.
Adelene Perkins
Thanks, Amanda. We’re looking forward to presenting our data at AACR in Washington, DC, and hope to see many of you there along with our IPI-549 study investigators at our investor event on Saturday evening April 1st. Please market on your calendars and Jaren will follow-up with the details. We hope you all have a good evening and stay safe from the storm, and thanks again for joining today’s call.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Infinity Pharmaceuticals Conference Call to discuss the Company’s Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2017. My name is Bruce, and I’ll be the lead operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session to follow. Please be advised that this call is being recorded at Infinity’s request.
At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today’s call, Ms. Jaren Madden, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Infinity. Please go ahead.
Jaren Madden
[Technical difficulty]
Scientific Officer; Claudio Dansky Ullmann, Senior Vice President, Clinical Development; Dr. Joe Pearlberg, the Medical Lead for our IPI-549 program; and Larry Bloch, President.
Following our remarks, we’ll open up the call for Q&A.
The press release issued earlier today details our results and is available on our website at infi.com. Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future expectations and plans, including clinical development objectives, the therapeutic potential of our product candidates, our strategic plans and financial projections.
Our actual results may differ materially from what we project today due to a number of important factors including the considerations described in the risk factor section of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 and in other filings we may make with SEC. These forward-looking statements represent our views as if only today, and we caution you that we may not update them in the future whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Adelene.
Adelene Perkins
Thanks, Jaren. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today’s call. 
We are very pleased with the adv advancements we’ve made with IPI-549, our oral selective PI3-kinase gamma inhibitor. Today, we’ll discuss our progress with the Phase I clinical study of IPI-549 in patients with advanced solid tumors and also review our first quarter 2017 financials.
[Technical difficulty]
Okay this is Adelene Perkins from Infinity Pharmaceuticals', we are very sorry about the technical difficulties, but we will begin right at the beginning of our prepared remarks again and remind you that the forward-looking that Jared Madden had read, they are still in impact. So we would appreciate for having you on today’s...
[Technical difficulty]
Including check point inhibitors. There is also a significant medical need for patients who do respond and then subsequently develop resistance to their immune therapy regimen. Given our preclinical data demonstrating that IPI-549 can overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade coupled with the clinical data recently presented at the AACR Annual Meeting we are encouraged about the potential of IPI-549 to address these medical needs.
Another reason we are enthusiastic about our IPI-549 is based on our published preclinical research which demonstrates that selectively targeting PI3-kinase gamma represents a novel immunoncoloogy approach by reprogramming macrophages within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment converting them from a pro-tumor to an anti-tumor phenotype.
While many immune therapies that are approved or are in development target T-cells there are few approaches in development target macrophages. And as a first and only selective PI3-kinase gamma inhibitor in the plant we have an opportunity to develop a first in class therapy which by virtue of its distinct effect on macrophages may uniquely compliment and enhance the activity of other therapies.

Our preclinical data which Jeff will review momentarily provided compelling rationale for our Phase I study and underscores the potential for IPI-549 to serve as a cornerstone in a broad range of combination therapies for the treatment of solid tumors.
Our ongoing Phase I trial is evaluating IPI-549 alone and with Opdivo, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with a broad range of advanced types of cancer. The study includes four phases or module, first mono therapy dose escalation, second, combination therapy dose escalation, third, monotherapy expansion and fourth, the combination therapy expansion.
Dose escalation modules I and II are critical to accessing the safety of IPI-549 and our ongoing as we work to determine optimal doses to evaluate in our expansion module. To expansion modules three and four, we expect to generate clinical data on the activity of IPI-549 in solid tumors including a non-small cell lung cancer melanoma and head and neck cancer.
We are pleased with the dose escalation data recently presented at AACR which demonstrated the IPI-549 was well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with Opdivo.
The data which Claudio will review in more detail show that there were no dose limiting toxicities or serious drug-related side effects, and no side effects led to treatment discontinuation.
As we look ahead, we expect to make progress in the following three key areas this year. First, we’ll complete enrollement in our two dose-escalation module and determine our recommended Phase 2 doses.
We anticipate finishing the mono-therapy dose escalation in the first half of the year and a combination module in the second half of the year. Second, we’ll begin enrolling patients in our expansion modules in the second half of 2017, and third, we’ll report additional data in a fair review form in the second half of this year.
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we’ve made and are continuing to make with IPS-549 while maintaining strong fiscal discipline. Our experienced team is executing with a great sense of urgency to deliver meaningful data within our current cash runway.
Now, Jeff will review the preclinical rationale for studying IPS-549 in solid tumors.
Jeff Kutok
Thanks, Adelene and good afternoon everyone
[Technical difficulty]
Publications in the general nature late last year we worked with collaborators at the University of California, San Diego and Memorial Sloan Kettering to explore the importance of targeting PI3K-gamma and cancer. In contrast to the other major PI3K isoforms, PI3K-gamma is highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and plays an important role in the pro-tumor function of these cells.
We discovered that blockade of PI3K-gamma signaling by treatment with IPI-549 results in a transcriptional reprogramming of tumor associated macrophages. This reprogramming shifts macrophages in the tumor microenvironment from the M2, or pro-tumor phenotype, to the M1, or anti-tumor phenotype, increasing the number of T cells that can attack the tumor and increasing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules.
This was an important finding because there has been a great interest in targeting tumor associated macrophages to augument anti-tumor responses.
In terms of preclinical activity we demonstrated dose dependent single agent anti tumor activity in multiple solid tumor models particularly [Indiscernible] that are rich in macrophages reinforcing the mechanism of action of IPI-549.
Additionally, in preclinical models treatment with IPI-549 in combination with the Checkpoint inhibitor showed greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival rates including a greater number of complete tumor aggressions when compared to treatment with IPI-549 or the checkpoint inhibitor alone.

The combination treatment resulted in long lasting anti tumor immune memory as evidenced by the lack of tumor growth upon re-challenge with the same tumor in the absence of any further treatment.
While the synergy between IPI-549 and checkpoint inhibitors was encouraging, resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy represents another challenge. Our preclinical data demonstrated that increased pro-tumor M2 macrophages are associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and treatment with IPI-549 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors can overcome this resistance through its effect on macrophages.
The key preclinical findings which lead the foundation of our clinical program are, first, PI3K-gamma has a very different biology than other PI3K isoforms. An innovation of the gamma isoform in macrophages affects the critical switch that we program as macrophages from the pro-tumor to the anti tumor phenotype.
Second, we’ve demonstrated the activity of IPI-549 in multiple preclinical models of cancer. And third, we’ve shown that IPI-549 can enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors as well as overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in cancer models.
Importantly, our ongoing Phase I study is a faithful [Indiscernible] of this preclinical research and Claudio will now review our clinical program in more detail.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
First, I’m really pleased with our progress with IPI-549 in the clinic. This afternoon I will review the design of our ongoing phase I study and summarize a data we presented at the AACR Annual Meeting last month. The objective of this study is to determine the safety, recommended Phase 2 dose, and activity of IPI-549 given orally once daily as monotherapy and combination with Opdivo in approximately 135 patients with advanced solid tumors.
As Adelene mentioned, the study includes four distinct phases or modules. The first two modules are dose escalations and the third and fourth modules represent expansion phases of the study.
Module one is evaluating the safety, durability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile of IPI-549 as monotherapy. We have completed patient enrollment in five cohorts evaluating doses ranging from 10 milligrams to 40 milligrams.
We are now enrolling patients in a cohort to evaluate the 60 milligram dose. We expect to complete enrolment in this module and determine a recommended single agent Phase 2 dose in the first half of this year.
Based on our monotherapy PK and PD data which showed significant suppression of PI3-kinase-gamma of 20 milligram, we initiated more then two. The role of this module is to demonstrate that IPI-549 and Opdivo can be safely combined and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose for this combination.
Currently Module two includes two cohorts evaluating IPI-549 at 20 milligrams and 30 milligrams combined with the standard regimen of Opdivo. We expect to complete this module in the second half of the year.
Our expansion cohorts represent a third and fourth modules of our study. Module three is design to asses the monotherapy activity of IPI-549 in a greater number of patients with a variety of advanced solid tumors.
Module four will evaluate the activity of IPI-549 in combination of Opdivo in patients with specific types of cancer including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
Importantly, enrollment to the disease-specific cohorts is reserved for patients who have demonstrated the initial resistance or who initially responded but subsequently develop resistance to checkpoint therapy.
This feature of module four is a direct test of whether IPI-549 can overcome checkpoint resistance as demonstrated in our clinical research values in nature. Additionally, first clinical research will be critical to helping us better understand how IPI-549 work in patients and will inform our future studies.

To that end, we have mandatory pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies in all expansion cohorts so that we can better understand effect of IPI-549 on tumors, the tumor characteristics of patients who respond and biomarker response of resistance.
We anticipate starting module three and four in the second half of the year. In April we reported that at from our tumor rule in a poster session at AACR Annual Meeting.. This data were from a March 20, 2017 data cutoff.
Monotherapy data from 2015 evaluable patients treated with doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 milligrams to 40 milligrams, demonstrated that IPI-549 was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities or serious drug related side effects occurred and no side effect led to treatment discontinuation or dose reduction.
The PK and PD properties of IPI-549 appear favourable with near complete and sustained inhibition of PI3K-gamma at doses at or above 20 milligram which supports ones daily dosing. Additionally, preliminary from six evaluable patients demonstrated that 20 milligram of IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo was well tolerated.
No dose Opdivo limiting toxicities or serious drug related side effects occur and no side effect led to treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, the combination did not result a new or unexpected side effects relating to the non-monotherapy safety profile of each treatment.
The PK profile of the Opdivo IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo appeared favourable as suggested that Opdivo does not affect the PK properties of IPI-549. Overall the data we reported give us cohorts in the profile of IPI-549.
Demonstrating a favourable tolerability profile for monotherapy and combined with Opdivo is a significant milestone for the program and will enable us to more formally stress the activity of IPI-549 in our expansion models. We are please with the progress we are making and we look forward to providing an update in the second half of 2017. 
Now Larry will review our financials results for the quarter.
Larry Bloch
Thank you, Claudio. The Infinity team is a very enthusiasm about IPI-549, which had the attributes of the type of medicine and it seek to advance. With the novel mechanism action and thoughtful clinical strategy to demonstrate the potential impact of this unique mechanism action addressing significant medical needs.
And in resolving our fiscal discipline, we are in strong position to complete all four modules of our clinical study within our current cash runway extend into the first quarter of 2019.
At March 31st, 2017 we had total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $75.4 million compared to $92.1 million at December 31, 2016. Cash used for operating activities during the first quarter of 2017 included $5.2 million of payments related to our 2016 restructuring activities.
If we did not report any revenue during the first quarter 2017, revenue for the first quarter 2016 was $9.3 million, all which related to the previous AbbVie collaboration for duvelisib.
R&D expense for the quarter was $4 million compared to $39.2 million for the same period last year. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.
General and administrative expense was $6.4 million for the first quarter compared to $10.8 million for the same period last year. The decrease in G&A expense was also primarily related to 2016 restructuring activities.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $10.5 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.21, compared to a net loss of $40.7 million, or a basic and diluted loss per common share of $0.82, for the same period last year.
Our 2017 financial guidance that we provided in January remains unchanged. We expect 2017 net loss to range from $40 million to $50 million and we expect in 2017 the cash invested balance ranging from $40 to $50 million.

Based on its current operational plans, which exclude additional funding or business development activities. We anticipate our existing cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 provide cash runway into the first quarter of 2019.
As I mentioned earlier, our cash runway allows us the time to generate safety and activity data from all four modules who are ongoing Phase 1 study of IPI-549. Overall we’re very pleased what achieved in so far this year and expect continue progress throughout 2017. Look forward to keep you update on Infinity as we see to bring considerable benefit to patients.
And now we’re happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time, I’m showing no questions. Pardon me our first question comes Katherine Xu from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is Adriane [ph] for Katherine and thanks for taking my question. In the past you’d mentioned that you’ve seen meaningful suppression of PI3-kinase that 20 mgs and higher. I was wondering if you had any more color on the differences that you’ve seen so far between 20 and 40 and other doses?
Adelene Perkins
So thank you, Adriane. That is data that we get presented AACR and perhaps Claudio can address the different doses.
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Yes. The common is that we are very pleased to see already of 20 milligrams based on our essay formation, gamma suppression that we were in that effective already effective, suppressive concentration. As we move up in the dose, obviously we see that there is some room for more sustain innovation of our demo target as we move up in the dosing and that’s what we see. It’s very incremental but the good thing is that all above the target of the percent innovation that we are looking at lease to think that that will have clear translation into what we called that IPI-549 is doing in suppressing the target. I don’t know if Jeff Kutok, our CSO would want to comment on that.
Jeff Kutok
No. I think, Claudio, that definitely summarizes it.
Unidentified Analyst
And what are you are for your recommended Phase 2?
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
So, we’re looking honestly to the totally of the data. So not only how the PK and PD performance characteristics are, and obviously the safety, and we will look at all the data, the integral package if you want and based on that we will decide. Right now as we mentioned we’re enrolling or certainly enrolling to 60 milligram cohort and then we will look at that data once we have all the patient enrolled and we’ll decide based on this parameters, how high we want to go, obviously it will depend if we see DLP story, we see that we have well within an optimal biological dose that we think can move forward. That would be the general assessment very standard on its own.
Unidentified Analyst
And do you see going higher than 34 the combo dosing?
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Can you repeat that, sorry.
Unidentified Analyst
Do you foresee possibly going higher than 30 milligrams in combination with Opdivo?
Claudio Dansky Ullmann
Well, it’s a possibility, but we’ll have see, we presented data, they share 20 milligrams and we’re right now evaluating the 30 milligrams cohort, and again looking at the totality of the data we’ll decide if we can go out or if we want go out to 40 milligrams in combination.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Operator
And at this time, I’m showing no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over Adelene for closing remarks.
Adelene Perkins
Thanks, Bruce. We’re excited about the opportunity we have with IPI-549 and our team is working hard to rapidly advance to our Phase 1 study. We look forward to providing additional updates on Infinity throughout the year and hope you’ll all have a good evening and thank you for joining us on today’s call. And I apologize again for the technical disruption at the beginning of the call. Thank you.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Padlock Therapeutics, a biotechnology company dedicated to creating new 
      medicines for destructive autoimmune diseases, today announced the 
      appointment of Adelene Q. Perkins, chairman and chief executive officer 
      of Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as the first independent member of 
      the company’s Board of Directors. Ms. Perkins is a highly-regarded 
      biopharmaceutical industry executive with 25 years of international 
      business and corporate strategy experience, focused on licensing and 
      business development, strategic finance, product life cycle management, 
      and building and leading high-caliber, cross-functional teams. Ms 
      Perkins has played an integral role leading Infinity in its transition 
      from a private, platform-based to a publicly-traded, product-based 
      organization. She has been instrumental in developing Infinity’s 
      business strategy, including the establishment of innovative strategic 
      partnerships.
    


      “Padlock’s mission to discover and develop novel treatments for 
      autoimmune diseases requires a team of people who are passionate 
      problem-solvers and who welcome the challenge to leverage exciting but 
      unproven science to provide transformative solutions to patients. 
      Adelene is such a person and we are thrilled to have her join our Board 
      to help us capitalize on the unique opportunity before us,” said Michael 
      Gilman, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Padlock. 
      "Adelene’s skill as a leader, company builder, and strategic thinker 
      will add great value to our board, as we make critical decisions about 
      how to expand the Padlock team and finance the many promising programs 
      in our portfolio.”
    

      “Padlock has assembled a group of the best and brightest leaders in PAD 
      enzyme biology and a deeply experienced management team, enabling them 
      to quickly make tremendous progress validating the potential for PAD 
      inhibitors to serve as robust new treatments for autoimmune disease,” 
      said Adelene Perkins. “It is exactly this pursuit of breakthrough 
      science and the entrepreneurial creativity that strives to bring 
      innovative products to patients that continue to inspire me. I am 
      delighted to join such a distinguished team and look forward to 
      supporting the milestones ahead.”
    

      Adelene Perkins has served as Infinity’s president and chief executive 
      officer since 2009 and was named chairman of the Board of Directors in 
      2012. She joined Infinity as chief business officer in 2002 and then 
      served as president from 2008-2009. Previously, Ms. Perkins served as 
      vice president of business and corporate development and was an early 
      member of the management team at TransForm Pharmaceuticals prior to its 
      acquisition by J&J. Prior to TransForm, from 1992-1999, she was at 
      Genetics Institute, now a unit of Pfizer, where she was vice president 
      of emerging businesses and the cofounder and general manager of the 
      DiscoverEase™ business unit. She also formed and served as chief 
      executive officer of MetaMorphix, a joint venture between Genetics 
      Institute and Johns Hopkins University directed at discovering and 
      developing members of the TGF-b superfamily. She joined Genetics 
      Institute in corporate and business development where she led corporate 
      and product strategy initiatives. Ms. Perkins began her career working 
      at Bain & Company, an international strategy consulting firm, where she 
      provided strategic and operational advice to clients in the healthcare 
      industry. Ms. Perkins received a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and 
      a B.S. in chemical engineering from Villanova University. She is on the 
      Boards of BIO (Biotechnology Industry Organization), the Massachusetts 
      Life Sciences Center, and the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council; she 
      is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Project Hope.
    

About PAD Enzymes and Autoimmune Disease


      Padlock’s founding hypothesis is that autoimmune disease can result from 
      the aberrant production of neo-antigens, materials not normally 
      expressed during homeostatic health and, as a consequence, recognized as 
      foreign by the immune system. These antigens drive both the initiation 
      and the subsequent development of disease by inducing maturation of the 
      immune response. Once disease is established, antigen production fuels 
      inflammatory cycles in affected organs and drives the formation and 
      deposition of immune complexes, which account for much of the morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with autoimmune disease. Therefore, in 
      patients where the source of neo-antigen is known, extinguishing antigen 
      production offers the potential to impact disease progression and 
      intensity without affecting systemic immunity.
    

      The protein-arginine deiminases (PADs) are a family of enzymes that 
      post-translationally modify arginine side chains on proteins to the 
      non-encoded amino acid citrulline. In some patients, these citrullinated 
      proteins are immunogenic. Therefore, PAD enzymes may be responsible for 
      producing the antigens that drive disease in these individuals. 
      Inhibiting PADs in these patients may provide an innovative and 
      orthogonal approach for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
      lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and other destructive 
      autoimmune diseases.
    

About Padlock


      Padlock Therapeutics is a private, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based 
      biotechnology company dedicated to creating new medicines to treat 
      destructive autoimmune diseases. The company leverages breakthrough 
      science on the biochemistry of the protein-arginine deiminase (PAD) 
      enzymes, the role of PADs in generating autoantigens, and the role of 
      protein citrullination in disease to develop novel drugs targeting the 
      PAD enzymes. Padlock was founded by scientists at The Scripps Research 
      Institute in conjunction with Atlas Venture. Padlock’s Series A 
      investors include Atlas 
      Venture, Johnson 
      & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc., MS 
      Ventures, and Index 
      Ventures. For more information on Padlock, visit www.padlocktherapeutics.com.

Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI) Names Adelene Q. Perkins Chief Executive Officer  











Tweet








12/7/2009 7:39:32 AM









CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 7, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced that Adelene Q. Perkins will become the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and join the company's Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2010 in accordance with an existing management succession plan. Steven H. Holtzman, Infinity's founder, and current Chair and Chief Executive Officer, will continue full-time involvement with the company as Executive Chair of its Board of Directors.

Ms. Perkins has over 25 years of international business and corporate strategy experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, focused on licensing and business development, strategic finance, product life cycle management, and leading high-caliber, cross-functional teams. Since joining Infinity in 2002, she has played an integral role in developing Infinity's strategic plan, leading the company in its transition from a platform to a product-based organization. She has also been the principal figure in structuring, executing and managing all of Infinity's innovative strategic relationships, including its global alliance with Purdue Pharmaceutical Products L.P. and Mundipharma International Corporation Ltd.

"Adelene is a highly skilled businessperson and an exceptional leader," said Steven H. Holtzman, Infinity's Chair and current Chief Executive Officer. "It is because of her vision and tenacity that Infinity is both strong today and positioned beautifully for the future, with a solid cash position and U.S. commercial rights to our entire oncology portfolio. Adelene is the ideal person to lead Infinity in our next phase of growth. It will be a pleasure and privilege to continue working together as we strive to achieve Infinity's mission of sustainably bringing meaningful new medicines to patients."

Mr. Holtzman has been the Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Infinity since its founding in 2001. As Executive Chair, Mr. Holtzman will remain actively involved in Infinity's major strategic initiatives, while also playing a key role in external relations and the company's internal leadership development programs.

"This management succession marks the culmination of a process initiated several years ago by Steve, working with Adelene and Julian Adams, to optimize Infinity's long-term leadership structure," said Anthony B. Evnin, Ph.D., Infinity's Lead Outside Director and Chair of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee of Infinity's Board of Directors. "The Board is very confident in Adelene's ability to lead Infinity through the next stage of its evolution, including the late phase development and commercialization of our products."

"Infinity's two lead programs, directed to inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone system and the Hedgehog pathway, represent some of the most exciting areas in cancer research. Our drug candidates in these programs hold great promise for patients with some of the most underserved and devastating cancers," said Ms. Perkins. "With a commitment to sustainability, we have also maintained a robust preclinical and discovery pipeline and anticipate entering the clinic with our novel FAAH inhibitor early in 2010.

-- Veteran deal-maker and company-builder provides extensive 
      corporate leadership and operational experience as Padlock expands its 
      team and advances multiple programs --




CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Padlock Therapeutics, a biotechnology company dedicated to creating new 
      medicines for destructive autoimmune diseases, today announced the 
      appointment of Adelene Q. Perkins, chairman and chief executive officer 
      of Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as the first independent member of 
      the company’s Board of Directors. Ms. Perkins is a highly-regarded 
      biopharmaceutical industry executive with 25 years of international 
      business and corporate strategy experience, focused on licensing and 
      business development, strategic finance, product life cycle management, 
      and building and leading high-caliber, cross-functional teams. Ms 
      Perkins has played an integral role leading Infinity in its transition 
      from a private, platform-based to a publicly-traded, product-based 
      organization. She has been instrumental in developing Infinity’s 
      business strategy, including the establishment of innovative strategic 
      partnerships.
    
“Padlock has assembled a group of the best and brightest leaders in PAD 
      enzyme biology and a deeply experienced management team, enabling them 
      to quickly make tremendous progress validating the potential for PAD 
      inhibitors to serve as robust new treatments for autoimmune disease”

      “Padlock’s mission to discover and develop novel treatments for 
      autoimmune diseases requires a team of people who are passionate 
      problem-solvers and who welcome the challenge to leverage exciting but 
      unproven science to provide transformative solutions to patients. 
      Adelene is such a person and we are thrilled to have her join our Board 
      to help us capitalize on the unique opportunity before us,” said Michael 
      Gilman, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Padlock. 
      "Adelene’s skill as a leader, company builder, and strategic thinker 
      will add great value to our board, as we make critical decisions about 
      how to expand the Padlock team and finance the many promising programs 
      in our portfolio.”
    

      “Padlock has assembled a group of the best and brightest leaders in PAD 
      enzyme biology and a deeply experienced management team, enabling them 
      to quickly make tremendous progress validating the potential for PAD 
      inhibitors to serve as robust new treatments for autoimmune disease,” 
      said Adelene Perkins. “It is exactly this pursuit of breakthrough 
      science and the entrepreneurial creativity that strives to bring 
      innovative products to patients that continue to inspire me. I am 
      delighted to join such a distinguished team and look forward to 
      supporting the milestones ahead.”
    

      Adelene Perkins has served as Infinity’s president and chief executive 
      officer since 2009 and was named chairman of the Board of Directors in 
      2012. She joined Infinity as chief business officer in 2002 and then 
      served as president from 2008-2009. Previously, Ms. Perkins served as 
      vice president of business and corporate development and was an early 
      member of the management team at TransForm Pharmaceuticals prior to its 
      acquisition by J&J. Prior to TransForm, from 1992-1999, she was at 
      Genetics Institute, now a unit of Pfizer, where she was vice president 
      of emerging businesses and the cofounder and general manager of the 
      DiscoverEase™ business unit. She also formed and served as chief 
      executive officer of MetaMorphix, a joint venture between Genetics 
      Institute and Johns Hopkins University directed at discovering and 
      developing members of the TGF-b superfamily. She joined Genetics 
      Institute in corporate and business development where she led corporate 
      and product strategy initiatives. Ms. Perkins began her career working 
      at Bain & Company, an international strategy consulting firm, where she 
      provided strategic and operational advice to clients in the healthcare 
      industry. Ms. Perkins received a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and 
      a B.S. in chemical engineering from Villanova University. She is on the 
      Boards of BIO (Biotechnology Industry Organization), the Massachusetts 
      Life Sciences Center, and the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council; she 
      is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Project Hope.
    

About PAD Enzymes and Autoimmune Disease


      Padlock’s founding hypothesis is that autoimmune disease can result from 
      the aberrant production of neo-antigens, materials not normally 
      expressed during homeostatic health and, as a consequence, recognized as 
      foreign by the immune system. These antigens drive both the initiation 
      and the subsequent development of disease by inducing maturation of the 
      immune response. Once disease is established, antigen production fuels 
      inflammatory cycles in affected organs and drives the formation and 
      deposition of immune complexes, which account for much of the morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with autoimmune disease. Therefore, in 
      patients where the source of neo-antigen is known, extinguishing antigen 
      production offers the potential to impact disease progression and 
      intensity without affecting systemic immunity.
    

      The protein-arginine deiminases (PADs) are a family of enzymes that 
      post-translationally modify arginine side chains on proteins to the 
      non-encoded amino acid citrulline. In some patients, these citrullinated 
      proteins are immunogenic. Therefore, PAD enzymes may be responsible for 
      producing the antigens that drive disease in these individuals. 
      Inhibiting PADs in these patients may provide an innovative and 
      orthogonal approach for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
      lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and other destructive 
      autoimmune diseases.
    

About Padlock


      Padlock Therapeutics is a private, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based 
      biotechnology company dedicated to creating new medicines to treat 
      destructive autoimmune diseases. The company leverages breakthrough 
      science on the biochemistry of the protein-arginine deiminase (PAD) 
      enzymes, the role of PADs in generating autoantigens, and the role of 
      protein citrullination in disease to develop novel drugs targeting the 
      PAD enzymes. Padlock was founded by scientists at The Scripps Research 
      Institute in conjunction with Atlas Venture. Padlock’s Series A 
      investors include Atlas 
      Venture, Johnson 
      & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc., MS 
      Ventures, and Index 
      Ventures. For more information on Padlock, visit www.padlocktherapeutics.com.
