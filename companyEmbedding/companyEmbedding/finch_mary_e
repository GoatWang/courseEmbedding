LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AECOM (NYSE:ACM), a premier, fully integrated global infrastructure 
      firm, announced today that Mary E. Finch has been named executive vice 
      president and chief human resources officer, effective Sept. 28.
    


      In this role, Finch will oversee AECOM’s human resources organization 
      worldwide with responsibility for talent acquisition and development; 
      employee relations, compensation and benefits; diversity; organization 
      planning and effectiveness; HR legal and regulatory compliance; and the 
      efficacy of the company’s succession-planning and Performance + Rewards 
      program. She will also be a member of AECOM’s Executive Leadership Team.
    

      Finch joins AECOM from Accenture, where she held positions of increasing 
      responsibility since 2001 and most recently was the senior managing 
      director and chief operating officer for global human resources, leading 
      4,500 HR professionals worldwide. Prior to joining Accenture, she held 
      progressive leadership roles with Abilizer Solutions and Accenture 
      legacy firm Andersen Consulting.
    

      “AECOM’s greatest strength is its people. Mary’s outstanding leadership 
      experience in advancing diverse workplace cultures that value employee 
      growth, engagement and success, and her ability to partner across groups 
      to execute business strategy, will significantly strengthen our team,” 
      said Michael S. Burke, AECOM chairman and chief executive officer. "I am 
      confident that her skills will improve AECOM’s ability to grow our 
      business as well as attract and retain the industry’s best talent.”
    

      Finch will be based at AECOM’s headquarters in Los Angeles.

Surname meaning for "Finch"
English: nickname from Middle English finch ‘finch’ (Old
English finc). In the Middle Ages this bird had a reputation
for stupidity. It may perhaps also in part represent a metonymic
occupational name for someone who caught finches and sold them as
songsters or for the cooking pot. The surname is found in all parts of
Britain but is most common in Lancashire. See also Fink.
