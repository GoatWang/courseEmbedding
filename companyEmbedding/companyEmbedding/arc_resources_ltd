	ARC is recognized as a top-tier oil and natural gas producer for the strength of its assets and management team. Our goal is to create value and provide superior, long-term returns to shareholders. This goal is realized through the development of large oil and natural gas pools. While growth has been an outcome, the focus for ARC is always “risk managed value creation”. 

	ARC has a history of proven performance. Since inception it has paid over 5 billion in total dividends and has provided over an 18 per cent annual return to shareholders.  ARC’s technical expertise in resource play development, combined with a disciplined approach to capital investment provides a strong base for continued value creation and sets the stage for profitable growth into the future.

ARC Resources Ltd Company Profile

   This ARC was not built to float on water. ARC Resources (formerly ARC Energy Trust) acquires and develops natural gas and petroleum properties in western Canada. In 2009 ARC's production averaged 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; its proved and probable reserves amounted to 379 million barrels of oil equivalent. Just over half of annual production is made up of natural gas and natural gas liquids; crude oil accounts for the rest. The company's most productive properties are located in Alberta, and British Columbia. In 2011 ARC Energy Trust converted to a corporation for better financial returns in the wake of a change in tax law that negatively affected income trusts.
  

   The company has more than tripled production in the tight shale play since 2000 to more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. In 2009 ARC acquired a general partnership (formed to hold oil and gas assets in its core Ante Creek area of northern Alberta) for $170 million. Further growing its asset base in northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta, in 2010 ARC acquired
   
    Storm Exploration
   
   for $652 million. To help raise cash to invest in its core activities in Northern Alberta, in 2011 the company sold assets in central Alberta for about $170 million.
  

   In 2007 the company acquired Flagship Energy Inc. in South  East Saskatchewan, adding more than 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent of reserves to ARC, as well as adding to its inventory of future drilling opportunities.
