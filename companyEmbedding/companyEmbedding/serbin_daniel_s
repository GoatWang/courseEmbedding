Mr. Serbin will stay on with the company for a period of time to support this leadership transition. “I would like to thank Dan for his leadership and loyalty and for the many talented Parker team members he has developed during his distinguished career,” said Tom Williams, Chief Executive Officer. “He has played a leadership role during a time of considerable growth and change for Parker always advocating for and preserving the distinct culture that allows Parker to sustain success over many years. He will be remembered for his truly genuine nature and his ability to build influential relationships across our global organization.” Mr. Serbin joined Parker in June 1980, as an Assistant Personnel Manager for the Hydraulic Valve Division in Elyria, Ohio.  During his career, he has held various positions in the Human Resources function including Area Industrial Relations Manager and Area Human Resources Manager as well as Vice President, Human Resources for Parker’s Fluid Connectors Group. His experience spans several groups, including Motion & Control, Seal, Filtration, Hydraulics and Fluid Connectors. “Mark is more than ready to take on this new executive leadership position having built considerable breadth and depth of experience across Parker’s operating groups,” added Williams. “He will have immediate impact in his role and is supported by a strong bench of talent within our human resources organization.  He will play a critical part in helping Parker achieve its goals.” Mr. Hart will be responsible for leading the human resources function globally as well as having responsibility for global benefits and compensation, learning and development, and external affairs. Mr. Hart began his career with Parker in February 2003 as Human Resources Vice President for the Instrumentation Group.  Subsequently, he became Human Resources Vice President for the Hydraulics Group and in 2005 was promoted to Area Human Resources Vice President. In 2011, he was named Human Resources Vice President for the Hydraulics Group with oversight responsibility for two other Parker operating groups. Most recently, he was Vice President of Global Total Rewards with responsibility for Parker’s benefits, compensation, health and wellness programs and the HRIS function. Prior to joining Parker, he held various human resources leadership positions at General Electric and Allied Signal.  He has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Marketing from the State University of New York at Plattsburgh and a Master of Science Degree in Management Systems, with a major in Human Resources Management, from Clarkson University.   About Parker Hannifin Corporation With annual sales of approximately $13 billion in fiscal year 2015, Parker Hannifin is the world's leading diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. Parker has increased its annual dividends paid to shareholders for 59 consecutive fiscal years, among the top five longest-running dividend-increase records in the S&P 500 index.  For more information, visit the company's website at www.parker.com, or its investor information website at www.phstock.com.       Media:

Parker Hannifin Corp.







					
					
					Daniel S. Serbin
				


FROM THE NOMINATION:  Much of Daniel S. Serbin's focus at Parker Hannifin Corp. is on the concept of employee empowerment.According to the nomination, Mr. Serbin is leading teams at Parker “to define Employee  Empowerment as a business differentiator that creates a competitive advantage for us by reflecting our unique values, promoting a structured approach to teamwork,  recognizing the contribution of all employees, and holding us  accountable for results.” The teams are being created and trained at Parker facilities across the world. In January, Mr. Serbin led an  effort to survey the company's 60,000 employees to measure  employee perceptions of both  empowerment and engagement.  More than 86% of Parker's work force responded to the survey, which was administered worldwide and translated into 30  languages. Mr. Serbin earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in public administration from Ohio State University. He also earned a law degree from Cleveland Marshall  College of Law. He joined the company in 1980 and held a number of human resources positions until he was named vice president of human resources in 2005. He was elevated to his current position in 2011. Parker's diversity strategy also has been a focus for Mr. Serbin. He assembled a global team to spell out the business case for inclusion and diversity, initiated a formal training program and established key metrics for inclusion and  diversity. Talent attraction and retention also are under Mr. Serbin's  umbrella. As such, he has built the company's efforts to attract and retain talented technology workers, especially in growing markets such as India and China. Additionally, Mr. Serbin has  focused on managing the company's health care benefits, developing wellness and preventive medicine programs. In a letter accompanying the nomination, Parker Hannifin chairman, president and CEO Donald E. Washkewicz said Mr. Serbin “truly understands and  actively advocates for the value that employees have in the success of our growing organization, and the foundation they provide for our future success.  “Every day, Dan exhibits the personal traits that we look for in our employees,” he wrote. “He is open and friendly, humble in success, conveys genuine caring for others ... and (is) innovative in developing programs that advance our goals.”

I would like to thank Mr. Daniel and everyone that works at Daniels for always being there to help with anything and everything no matter what our need is. Anytime we phone or e-mail with a question or a problem, your employees are very quick to respond with an answer. As a School District we appreciate the service that you offer to all of our employees.
