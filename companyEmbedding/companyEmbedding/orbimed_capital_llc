The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
