            - DANIEL U.          





    <Provider name locked. >Promised computer next day, was told it was ready but he couldn't deliver it so made appointment next morning 9 am. At 9 am he couldn't drive to my home so I said I would drive to his home. I was almost there when he called and said computer not finished. He needed another hour.  I went to my appointments an and let him know I was on my way back ( 2 hours later) but he needed more time. 3 hours later I get the computer. When I set it up at home, found out he did not do any microsoft updates  and never put in the numbers so I would have been locked out of microsoft in 3 days. He did not complete his work. I asked for some money back, he agreed but never kept his promise. Provider name locked. >

 

            - monica L.          




Promptly returned my call. He was not sure he could help but said he would try and if he could not fix the problem he would not take a fee. He called back several times although some calls were not timely and did fix the problem. Much more time was spent than I paid for, until the problem was fixed. This fix was done remotely by phone so no on site work was required.
 

            - Edward D.

			Wolf Point West
		




Kennedys seek buyer for Wolf Point apartment tower ​


The Kennedy family and its partners are seeking buyers for a new 48-story apartment tower on Wolf Point as they get ready to break ground on an even bigger high-rise next door.A joint venture including the Kennedys and Hines Interests has hired the Chicago office of HFF to sell Wolf Point West, the first of three planned buildings on the site at the confluence of the Chicago River's north and south branches. Rents in the 509-unit tower, which offers striking views of the river, are among the highest in Chicago, one reason the property could draw a lofty price.The developers are selling the building mainly to focus on their next project on the site, a 66-story, $360-million tower called Wolf Point East, said Greg Van Schaack, senior managing director in the Chicago office of Houston-based Hines. They've almost lined up their construction financing for that high-rise, which will have 707 apartments, and plan to break ground in May, he said.Christopher Kennedy, meanwhile, who oversees his family's real estate holdings, also has another venture that needs some attention: his campaign for Illinois governor, which he launched last month.Whether the political winds blow in Kennedy's favor, the winds are shifting in the downtown apartment market. The last several years have been some of the best in decades for landlords and developers, as surging demand for apartments has pushed up rents and property values.WILL​ SUPPLY​ DAMPEN​ ENTHUSIASM?Yet the market is cooling amid a building boom that's expected to add about 8,000 units to downtown Chicago in 2017 and 2018—a 23 percent increase in supply—and occupancies are already falling. The question is whether the bulging supply will dampen investors' enthusiasm for downtown apartments, pulling prices down.Wolf Point West is holding up fine so far. The building at 343 W. Wolf Point Place., southwest of the Merchandise Mart, opened in January 2016 and is 85 percent occupied. Apartments there rent for $3.65 to $3.70 per square foot, making it one of the 10 most expensive buildings in the city."The building has had an incredible lease-up and the owners have received unsolicited offers," HFF Executive Managing Direct Matthew Lawton said in an email. "They thought it best to engage HFF to conduct a thorough process to establish the market value."The Kennedys and Hines own Wolf Point in a joint venture with the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust and Chicago-based Magellan Development Group. The Kennedys and Hines are teaming up on the Wolf Point East project also with the AFL-CIO trust, which invests in real estate for union workers' pension plans. LONG-TERM​ FOCUSIf the downtown construction boom has made some apartment buyers wary, that hasn't shown up in prices yet. Van Schaack acknowledges that downtown has more apartments than it needs right now, but sees it as a temporary phenomenon that will clear up by 2019. And many investors that focus on so-called core properties—trophy buildings in top locations, like Wolf Point—like to hold properties for a long time and are less focused on the ups and downs of the real estate cycle."We think there are still super-core buyers that are seeking the best of the best," Van Schaack said.He will soon find out how much they think his building is worth. Designed by Chicago-based BKL Architecture, the tower cost $160 million, or about $314,000 per unit, to build. Lawton of HFF expects the building "to get record pricing."The current Chicago apartment record stands at $707,000 per unit, the price paid last year for a 198-unit building at 850 N. Lake Shore Drive. But that sale is a bit of an outlier because the building's apartments are so big. A better comparison may be the prior record, the sale OneEleven, a 504-unit tower at 111 W. Wacker Drive that sold for $651,000 per unit in 2015.Even if an investor pays $600,000 a unit—about $305 million—the sale would generate a huge payday for the Kennedys and Hines. But Van Schaack wouldn't offer a price prediction when asked."We're not sure what to expect," he said. "That's why we're marketing it."
