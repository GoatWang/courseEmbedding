iConsumer Turns Its E-Commerce Customers Into Stockholders

		  iConsumer Gets a Jumpstart Under The JOBS Act
		

Sep 22, 2015, 11:34 ET
		  		  			
									 from   iConsumer 











 
















































 

 




















 


CHICAGO, Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- iConsumer is the first company of its kind: a coupon and cash back website/app that also rewards customer loyalty by giving away ownership. iConsumer turns their customers into stockholders every time they shop for deals and coupons, earn cash back rebates and refer friends to shop. 
iConsumer offers access to savings on more than 45,000 brands and cash back from 1600+ stores such as Target, Overstock.com and Expedia in addition to giving away stock in iConsumer. 
Founded by Robert Grosshandler, creator of the trailblazing e-philanthropy site iGive, iConsumer is the first company leveraging Title IV, Tier 2 ("Reg. A+") of the 2012 JOBS Act. Upon iConsumer's SEC qualification, iConsumer customers will receive freely tradeable stock in this new kind of public company.
"iConsumer is the only company to offer tradeable stock to all of its customers," says Grosshandler. "We're building on the premise that ordinary people, the 99%, should have access to the startup economy. Consumers – if they know it or not – help companies grow big, go public and become very valuable; we at iConsumer believe those customers should be rewarded for their contributions."  
Grosshandler adds, "Congress made crowdfunding a startup possible. The SEC's rules made it practical. We turned it inside out by making every customer a shareholder."
iConsumer's innovative features include:

Ownership: Sign up as a member on www.iconsumer.com to automatically receive 100 free shares of stock. Referring new users to iConsumer also earns customers 100 more free shares. With every dollar of cash back earned, they also earn a dollar of iConsumer stock. 
Shopping: With more than 45,000 brands and 1600+ stores offering deals on iConsumer, there is an incredible selection of saving opportunities. Coupons and exclusive sales take place daily on iConsumer with thousands of cash back deals on everything from flowers to hotels. iConsumer also offers in-store coupons and deals for shoppers who prefer to shop in brick-and-mortar stores. 
Benefits: Being an iConsumer owner is about more than money, it's about being part of the iConsumer community – learning about startups, learning about investing and helping to build the business. iConsumer is releasing its Shareholder Academy next quarter, where shareholders and visitors can participate in the growth of a startup, learning about the thrills and opportunities a growing business encounters.
iConsumer filed with the SEC in September. Once SEC qualified, iConsumer Corp. will comply with the heightened transparency and accountability the SEC regulations require. This includes audited financial statements, quarterly and annual reports and management discussions about performance. In keeping with its goal of educating its shareholders, iConsumer will host webinars, provide financial dashboards and opportunities for interaction with management (See Shareholder Academy above). In addition to customers earning stock, accredited and unaccredited investors will be able to invest in iConsumer via StartEngine.com, an equity crowdfunding portal.
ABOUT ICONSUMER: iConsumer is the first company to make every customer a shareholder with tradeable stock. iConsumer offers great savings with deals and coupons from 45,000+ brands, and enables customers to earn cash back from 1600+ stores such as Target, Overstock and Expedia as well as earn stock in iConsumer with each purchase. Founded by e-philanthropy pioneer Robert Grosshandler, iConsumer is designed to help everyday people participate in building their financial future. For more information, visit www.iconsumer.com.

DISCLAIMER. iConsumer is "testing the waters" under Securities Act of 1933 regulation. This process allows companies to determine whether there may be an interest in an eventual offering of its securities. The company is not under any obligation to make an offering under Regulation A. It may choose to make an offering to some, but not all, of the people who indicate an interest in investing, and that offering might not be made under Regulation A. If the company does go ahead with an offering, it will only be able to make sales after it has filed an offering statement with the SEC and the SEC has "qualified" the offering statement. The information in that offering statement will be more complete than the information the company is providing now, and could differ in important ways. Investors must read the documents filed with the SEC before investing. Statements herein apply only to U.S. citizens.

Ad Tracking Policy

                    We Engage in Interest-Based Advertising.
                

                    iConsumer.com and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include apps.
                

                    Interest-based advertising includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits 
					or online activities. For example, providing you with coupons we think you would like based on your shopping activity. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also 
					be served in emails or through our iConsumer Button Browser App. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.
                

                    Our interest-based advertising is also available via certain web search services provided by third parties we work with.
                

                    How Is Relevant Information Gathered for Interest-Based Advertising?
                

                    To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. For example, we or our partners might 
					look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. This includes our iConsumer Button Browser App, where we gather 
					information about your activities on sites you visit after you have downloaded the iConsumer Button Browser App.
                

                    We work with third parties who might help gather this information or with whom we might share your information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information 
					they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.
                

                    See below for what technologies we use to gather this information.
                

                    You Have Options Over the Interest-Based Ads You See.
                

                    The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising 
					purposes. If you want to opt out, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Your opt-out is both browser and device specific.
                

                    See below for your options relating to other tracking technologies, including how you can control our iConsumer Button Browser App’s tracking.
                

                    We Use Various Tracking Technologies.
                

                    We–or third parties we work with–use several common data collection technologies including cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies. . We collect personal information about users 
					over time and across different Web sites when you use this Web site or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We do this for many reasons, including 
					the following:
                


                        To engage in interest-based advertising as discussed above.
                    

                        To understand the activities and behaviors of customers and platform users.
                    

                        To recognize new visitors to our websites.
                    

                        To recognize past customers.
                    

                        To present more personalized content and offers, to improve your website experience, optimize your shopping experience, and provide site and service enhancements. For example, 
						to avoid repeatedly showing you the same advertisements.
                    

                        To serve customized advertising (whether on our website or others you visit).
                    

                        So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests. For example, to understand what ads are of interest to consumers.
                    

                        To track your purchases so you can earn Cash Back.
                    


                    We work with third parties who provide us with certain web search services.
                

                    How to Control Tracking Technologies.
                

Cookies: You may control our use of browser cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies. To control 
					flash cookies go to http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html. 
					Why? Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and thus your browser settings will not affect them. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to access 
					certain functionality on our site or the iConsumer Button Browser App. This includes not being able to effectively measure our site or advertising. It also means we may not be able to deliver 
					tailored ads. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.
                

                    Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not 
					currently set up to respond to those signals.
                

iConsumer Button Browser App: Even if you disable cookies, our iConsumer Button Browser App will continue to track your browsing behavior. To disable all tracking by the 
					iConsumer Button Browser App, you can uninstall it. Unless you uninstall the iConsumer Button Browser App, it will continue to track your browsing behavior.

How iConsumer Works


Join now and we'll reserve 100 shares of iConsumer stock for you!
Earn 100 MORE shares of stock for each friend you refer.  So tell your friends!
The Quick Answer

        	Shop at over 1,700 stores and get Cash Back rebates.  Use coupons from over 1,700 stores to save money. Earn shares in iConsumer when you get Cash Back.  Earn more shares when the friends you refer earn Cash Back.  And if iConsumer becomes big and valuable, you may sell those shares.  Use our site, Android and Apple apps and browser add-ons to make it easy.
		
The Big Picture

        	The crowd's creating the biggest, baddest, coolest company ever. Where the 99% make the 1% envious.  The crowd builds the company, becomes the customers, owns the company, and if we're successful enough that the company pays dividends or gets sold or goes public in an IPO (think Facebook, Uber, Groupon) the 99% reap the financial rewards of ownership.
		
Save & Earn Today, Build for Tomorrow

        	Shareholders (that's you - and being a shareholder is free) save money with coupons and deals.  Just like those other guys.  Shareholders (that's still you) earn Cash Back rebates when they shop.  We send that Cash Back to you.  Just like those other guys.  But, at iConsumer, you're an owner.  If we succeed at building something big and valuable, you share financially in that success.  Not like the other guys.  Not like anything you've ever seen before.    
		
Ownership - The Special Sauce

        	When you're an owner of something, special things happen.  You take pride, you tell your friends, 
			you use it more.  Every iConsumer is an owner. Shares.  Stock. You'll want to help it grow fast, and 
			that's important.  Because bigger is better, and faster is better.  The bigger it grows, the faster 
			it grows, the more valuable iConsumer becomes.
		

        	So, you've got an opportunity to own a piece of a startup company, for free.  That sounds great, but what does it really mean? Most people have never invested in a startup. 
			Heck, many people have never invested in anything. We've created a web site to provide you with tools and knowledge you need to be smart about it. 
			It's called Shareholder Academy
			and it contains a ton of great information to get you started. www.ShareholderAcademy.com

How Do I Cash In?

        	The thrills and chills of ownership.  By law, you're able to sell your shares.  But, we can't promise you that somebody will want to buy them, or how much they'd pay.  On the other hand, we really, really want those shares to be valuable, and for lots of people to want to buy them.  So we'll be working on that, every day.

About Us

					The world doesn't need another way to shop, even one that offers great deals and Cash Back on every purchase. So we decided to do the unheard of. We created a way where shoppers 
					not only get discounts and rebates, but something even more valuable – our company. Every one of our members participates in our success by earning stock as they shop.  
                

					It's a completely different way to build a company. And that's exactly why we did it. It's the one place where shoppers are truly invested.
                

					Welcome to iConsumer. #GetYourShare

                    Sandi Schleicher, Co-Founder & CTO

					Chief Technology Officer of iGive and Director of Engineering for j2 Global Communications (JCOM - NASDAQ), bringing his entrepreneurial and corporate experience.
                

                    Melinda Moore, CMO

Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements
We are disclosing forward-looking information so that investors, potential investors, and other owners can better understand iConsumer Corp.’s (the “Company”) future prospects and make informed investment decisions. The information on this website contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often include words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance.
 
The Company's forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company's business and performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events, circumstances and results. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The Company's actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in its forward-looking statements include government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions and the following factors:

recent and future changes in technology, services and standards, including, but not limited to, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital media and evolving home entertainment formats;
changes in consumer behavior, including changes in spending behavior and changes in when, where and how digital content is consumed;
changes in the Company's plans, initiatives and strategies, and consumer acceptance thereof;
changes in the plans, initiatives and strategies of the third parties that provide content and/or opportunities for cash back rebates to the Company;
competitive pressures, including as a result of audience fragmentation and changes in technology;
the Company's ability to deal effectively with economic slowdowns or other economic or market difficulties;
changes in advertising market conditions or advertising expenditures due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior, pressure from public interest groups, changes in laws and regulations and other societal or political developments;
piracy and the Company's ability to exploit and protect its intellectual property rights in and to its content and other products;
increased volatility or decreased liquidity in the capital markets, including any limitation on the Company's ability to access the capital markets for debt securities, refinance its outstanding indebtedness or obtain bank financings on acceptable terms;
the effects of any significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions by the Company;
the failure to meet earnings expectations;
the adequacy of the Company's risk management framework;
changes in U.S. GAAP or other applicable accounting policies;
the impact of terrorist acts, hostilities, natural disasters (including extreme weather) and pandemic viruses;
a disruption or failure of the Company's or its vendors' network and information systems or other technology relied on by the Company;
changes in tax, federal communication and other laws and regulations;
currency exchange restrictions and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries;
changes in foreign exchange rates; and

Any forward-looking statement made by the Company speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

2Click on a coupon or deal at your favorite store with Cash Back on iConsumer.com, and we'll send you to the site so you can start shopping.

How iConsumer Works


Join now and we'll reserve 100 shares of iConsumer stock for you!
Earn 100 MORE shares of stock for each friend you refer.  So tell your friends!
The Quick Answer

        	Shop at over 1,700 stores and get Cash Back rebates.  Use coupons from over 1,700 stores to save money. Earn shares in iConsumer when you get Cash Back.  Earn more shares when the friends you refer earn Cash Back.  And if iConsumer becomes big and valuable, you may sell those shares.  Use our site, Android and Apple apps and browser add-ons to make it easy.
		
The Big Picture

        	The crowd's creating the biggest, baddest, coolest company ever. Where the 99% make the 1% envious.  The crowd builds the company, becomes the customers, owns the company, and if we're successful enough that the company pays dividends or gets sold or goes public in an IPO (think Facebook, Uber, Groupon) the 99% reap the financial rewards of ownership.
		
Save & Earn Today, Build for Tomorrow

        	Shareholders (that's you - and being a shareholder is free) save money with coupons and deals.  Just like those other guys.  Shareholders (that's still you) earn Cash Back rebates when they shop.  We send that Cash Back to you.  Just like those other guys.  But, at iConsumer, you're an owner.  If we succeed at building something big and valuable, you share financially in that success.  Not like the other guys.  Not like anything you've ever seen before.    
		
Ownership - The Special Sauce

        	When you're an owner of something, special things happen.  You take pride, you tell your friends, 
			you use it more.  Every iConsumer is an owner. Shares.  Stock. You'll want to help it grow fast, and 
			that's important.  Because bigger is better, and faster is better.  The bigger it grows, the faster 
			it grows, the more valuable iConsumer becomes.
		

        	So, you've got an opportunity to own a piece of a startup company, for free.  That sounds great, but what does it really mean? Most people have never invested in a startup. 
			Heck, many people have never invested in anything. We've created a web site to provide you with tools and knowledge you need to be smart about it. 
			It's called Shareholder Academy
			and it contains a ton of great information to get you started. www.ShareholderAcademy.com

How Do I Cash In?

        	The thrills and chills of ownership.  By law, you're able to sell your shares.  But, we can't promise you that somebody will want to buy them, or how much they'd pay.  On the other hand, we really, really want those shares to be valuable, and for lots of people to want to buy them.  So we'll be working on that, every day.

How iConsumer Works


Join now and we'll reserve 100 shares of iConsumer stock for you!
Earn 100 MORE shares of stock for each friend you refer.  So tell your friends!
The Quick Answer

        	Shop at over 1,700 stores and get Cash Back rebates.  Use coupons from over 1,700 stores to save money. Earn shares in iConsumer when you get Cash Back.  Earn more shares when the friends you refer earn Cash Back.  And if iConsumer becomes big and valuable, you may sell those shares.  Use our site, Android and Apple apps and browser add-ons to make it easy.
		
The Big Picture

        	The crowd's creating the biggest, baddest, coolest company ever. Where the 99% make the 1% envious.  The crowd builds the company, becomes the customers, owns the company, and if we're successful enough that the company pays dividends or gets sold or goes public in an IPO (think Facebook, Uber, Groupon) the 99% reap the financial rewards of ownership.
		
Save & Earn Today, Build for Tomorrow

        	Shareholders (that's you - and being a shareholder is free) save money with coupons and deals.  Just like those other guys.  Shareholders (that's still you) earn Cash Back rebates when they shop.  We send that Cash Back to you.  Just like those other guys.  But, at iConsumer, you're an owner.  If we succeed at building something big and valuable, you share financially in that success.  Not like the other guys.  Not like anything you've ever seen before.    
		
Ownership - The Special Sauce

        	When you're an owner of something, special things happen.  You take pride, you tell your friends, 
			you use it more.  Every iConsumer is an owner. Shares.  Stock. You'll want to help it grow fast, and 
			that's important.  Because bigger is better, and faster is better.  The bigger it grows, the faster 
			it grows, the more valuable iConsumer becomes.
		

        	So, you've got an opportunity to own a piece of a startup company, for free.  That sounds great, but what does it really mean? Most people have never invested in a startup. 
			Heck, many people have never invested in anything. We've created a web site to provide you with tools and knowledge you need to be smart about it. 
			It's called Shareholder Academy
			and it contains a ton of great information to get you started. www.ShareholderAcademy.com

How Do I Cash In?

        	The thrills and chills of ownership.  By law, you're able to sell your shares.  But, we can't promise you that somebody will want to buy them, or how much they'd pay.  On the other hand, we really, really want those shares to be valuable, and for lots of people to want to buy them.  So we'll be working on that, every day.

How iConsumer Works


Join now and we'll reserve 100 shares of iConsumer stock for you!
Earn 100 MORE shares of stock for each friend you refer.  So tell your friends!
The Quick Answer

        	Shop at over 1,700 stores and get Cash Back rebates.  Use coupons from over 1,700 stores to save money. Earn shares in iConsumer when you get Cash Back.  Earn more shares when the friends you refer earn Cash Back.  And if iConsumer becomes big and valuable, you may sell those shares.  Use our site, Android and Apple apps and browser add-ons to make it easy.
		
The Big Picture

        	The crowd's creating the biggest, baddest, coolest company ever. Where the 99% make the 1% envious.  The crowd builds the company, becomes the customers, owns the company, and if we're successful enough that the company pays dividends or gets sold or goes public in an IPO (think Facebook, Uber, Groupon) the 99% reap the financial rewards of ownership.
		
Save & Earn Today, Build for Tomorrow

        	Shareholders (that's you - and being a shareholder is free) save money with coupons and deals.  Just like those other guys.  Shareholders (that's still you) earn Cash Back rebates when they shop.  We send that Cash Back to you.  Just like those other guys.  But, at iConsumer, you're an owner.  If we succeed at building something big and valuable, you share financially in that success.  Not like the other guys.  Not like anything you've ever seen before.    
		
Ownership - The Special Sauce

        	When you're an owner of something, special things happen.  You take pride, you tell your friends, 
			you use it more.  Every iConsumer is an owner. Shares.  Stock. You'll want to help it grow fast, and 
			that's important.  Because bigger is better, and faster is better.  The bigger it grows, the faster 
			it grows, the more valuable iConsumer becomes.
		

        	So, you've got an opportunity to own a piece of a startup company, for free.  That sounds great, but what does it really mean? Most people have never invested in a startup. 
			Heck, many people have never invested in anything. We've created a web site to provide you with tools and knowledge you need to be smart about it. 
			It's called Shareholder Academy
			and it contains a ton of great information to get you started. www.ShareholderAcademy.com

How Do I Cash In?

        	The thrills and chills of ownership.  By law, you're able to sell your shares.  But, we can't promise you that somebody will want to buy them, or how much they'd pay.  On the other hand, we really, really want those shares to be valuable, and for lots of people to want to buy them.  So we'll be working on that, every day.
