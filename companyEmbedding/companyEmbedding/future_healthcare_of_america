Futurist FAQ





What's a futurist?


Let's start by saying what a futurist is not. A futurist is not someone who "tells the future." We don't read tea leaves, tarot cards, crystal balls, or tell fortunes. Those who confuse us with soothsayers have never had any dealings with a futurist.


Instead, a futurist is someone who spends time thinking about what might happen in the future, and especially what are the forces at work that will shape and affect our futures. This is not magic, it merely takes time and effort. A professional futurist is someone who takes time to research, study, and think about the future, just as a biologist is someone who takes time to research, study, and think about biology. The end result of a futurist's efforts is, or should be, a better understanding of the future so that it is easier to make intelligent plans about the future.


In short, then, a futurist is a planner, not a prophet.



Are there any futurists I might have heard of?


The earliest futurists I became aware of when I was in university in the late 60's were Buckminster Fuller and Herman Kahn. Shortly thereafter Alvin Toffler hit the best-seller list with Future Shock (1970). More recently, John Naisbett and Patricia Aburdene came to international prominance with their best-seller, Megatrends.


There are lots of other futurists, including Richard Lamm, former governor of the state of Colorado; science (and science fiction) writer Arthur C. Clarke; American Vice-President Al Gore; and the Grand High Pooh-Bah of management science fiction, Peter Drucker. These are not necessarily the best futurists, but they are probably the best known futurists. Within the futurist community, there are a large number of people who are experts in a wide range of fields. In all, I understand that there are something like 30,000 members of the World Future Society. Of these, perhaps 1,000 are professional futurists who make their living this way.


So, while futurists may not be common, neither are we an endangered species.



How do you predict the future?


I don't. It's not my job to predict the future. Indeed, I don't think that anybody can accurately and consistently predict the future. Instead, it's my job to help people plan intelligently for the future. I do this by trying to anticipate what might happen, what early warning signs to look for, and then help people create contingency plans to deal with these possibilities.



All right, how do you anticipate the future?


There are several specific future studies techniques, which will only be touched on here. An environmental scan is just that: watching what is happening elsewhere to see if it has relevance to you and what you do. Hence, for instance, social trends often start in northern Europe before reaching North America. Within North America, they often start on the west coast, frequently in the San Francisco area.


Scenario planners dissect the future into major forces, then try to decide how each force might change the status quo. Their ultimate objective is to produce from two to five different scenarioes that they feel portray the major possibilities for the future, along with the "tell-tales" or early warning indicators, that will help you decide which future is likely to come to pass.


There are other tools as well that are less widely used, from complexity theory to Delphi techniques. However, at the end, all of these have one central shared feature: those who use any of these techniques must be well-informed about what is happening now, and they must be able to think clearly and coherently about what the next logical consequences might be. Therefore, the simple answer to "How do you do it?" is: learn widely, and think well.



It must be pretty easy talking about things that might
happen 20 years from now. Who's going to remember?


Since I'm not trying to predict the future, I don't worry about whether people remember what I said 20 years ago (although I've done pretty well, looking back). Instead, I hold myself to a higher standard: when I'm finished speaking with you, have I changed the way you perceive the future, think about the future, and prepare for the future? If so, then I've done my job, whether it turns out 20 years from now that I was right. You should be able to tell when I walk out of the room whether I did my job. It's a subjective measure, and it's your call.



In the 1970's, futurists were predicting that by the 1990's we'd all be working 20 hour weeks, taking 8 weeks vacation a year, flying personal helicopters, vacationing on the moon, and having our housework done by robots. What happened?


Actually, it was the popular press that predicted these things, not the then fledgling futurist community. However, dealing with the predictions themselves, several things were overlooked.


First, concerning the amount of time we'd spend working, we forgot one crucial thing. The future described in this question is the one I describe as the "George Jetson" future. George Jetson worked at Spacely Sprockets, arriving at his office around 10:30, sitting with his feet up on his desk until lunch, then pushing a button and going home.


Nobody thought to ask the question that if pushing a button once a day was all that George Jetson did for a living, then why would Spacely Sprockets need George Jetson in the first place? The implications of that overlooked question go a long way towards describing why we aren't working a 20 hour week - and why those of us who are working feel like we're working more hours, not less. The combination of automation and competition of the Rapidly Developing Countries is changing the face and nature of work - as described in my 1994 book, Facing the Future.


Robots are here, but they're used mostly in very restricted industrial applications, not for doing household chores. It turns out that human beings are far more flexible (adaptable) and far smarter than we ever imagined - as we found out when we started serious work on robots.


There are several major issues in robotics that are going to have to be solved before we can have Jetson-like robot servants, and the solution to these problems is not especially close at hand, as far as I know. Chief among these issues are vision (the ability to distinguish what is being seen in a camera lens); movement (the ability to discriminate between objects within the field of view, and to avoid obstacles in the real world); and durability (the ability to survive in hot or cold, dry or damp, and dusty and dirty environments). There are several other problems as well.


Helicopters replacing cars was more of a MAD magazine fantasy than a realistic expectation. People forgot just how complex a task it is to fly even a fixed wing airplane, and helicopters are probably the most difficult of all flying machines to master. It takes a lot more work than learning to drive a car, and most people don't see the value in doing so.


As for vacationing on the moon, I'm just as disappointed as you are - maybe moreso as I've always wanted to visit the moon (or "Luna" as we science fiction fans typically call it). The reasons for the disappointment are NASA, the U.S. Congress, and public opinion. NASA wasted billions of dollars on what amounted to public relations gimmicks, and did it in typical bungling, bureaucratic fashion ("An elephant is a mouse built to government specifications.")


Worse, when they did get results, they threw them away as soon as public interest (and hence Congressional funding) started to wane. Just as the Apollo missions, for example, were starting to produce significant scientific information on selenology (the lunar counterpart to geology), Congress cut funding for the space program, and NASA stopped sending missions to the moon. My view about a manned (personed?) mission to Mars are along these lines: it's a public relations stunt, and little more. There are more valuable objectives in space exploitation closer to home.



How do you make your living as a futurist?


As a futurist, I make my living by consulting, writing, and speaking. I consult to organizations and associations that want someone to help them plan for the future. For more information about my activities, see Professional Services.


Hence, for the major telecommunications companies in Canada, through the Stentor Resource Centre, I worked with a group of other professionals in trying to identify how the communications industry was going to change over the next two decades. For the same group, I also worked with a grade eight class of children, helping them learn brainstorming techniques, and facilitating their thoughts and ideas about the future. The whole process took more than six months.


At the other end of the spectrum, I do keynote speeches for companies and industry associations. The shortest of these has been 10 minutes in length for the Soap & Detergent Association of the United States. This presentation was tightly scripted, video-taped using special effects,and kicked off a half-day satellite broadcast to about 5,000 people across North America. A more normal speech might be from an hour to an hour and a half. I also do seminars and workshops that last from half a day to a full weekend retreat, and will tailor such events to the organization and their objectives.


Over the course of a year, I speak to something on the order of 20,000 people in the United States and Canada at between 60 and 70 events.

Hospitals and Care Systems of the Future


Hospitals and health systems in the United States are facing an unparalleled force to change. Industry experts have projected that multiple, intersecting pressures will drive the transformation of health care delivery and financing from volume- to value-based payments over the next decade. In the current regulatory and economic environment, hospitals must focus their efforts on performance initiatives that are essential in the short term and that will also remain critical for long-term success.
The inaugural report of the AHA Committee on Performance Improvement details “Hospitals and Care Systems of the Future.” The team conducted exploratory interviews and analyzed the results to identify must-do, priority strategies and core organizational competencies organizations should establish to remain successful in this time of sweeping change.
Must-Do Strategies to Succeed in the Future

Aligning hospitals, physicians and other providers across the care continuum
Utilizing evidence-based practices to improve quality and patient safety
Improving efficiency through productivity and financial management
Developing integrated information systems
Joining and growing integrated provider networks and care systems
Educating and engaging employees and physicians to create leaders
Strengthening finances to facilitate reinvestment and innovation
Partnering with payers
Advancing through scenario-based strategic, financial and operational planning
Seeking population health improvement through pursuit of the “triple aim”

Organizations on path to implement the above must-do strategies should achieve competency in several areas of care delivery and organizational management. Similar to the strategies, these competencies are intrinsically connected and aligned.
Organizational Core Competencies

Design and implementation of patient-centered, integrated care
Creation of accountable governance and leadership
Strategic planning in an unstable environment
Internal and external collaboration
Financial stewardship and enterprise risk management
Engagement of full employee potential
Collection and utilization of electronic data for performance improvement

This report will mobilize hospital senior leadership teams to consider the strategies they must deploy to adapt and succeed in the future. Change is happening. It is up to each organization to plan its unique path to embrace the opportunities ahead.

About Richard Worzel





I am a futurist, and a professional member of the World Future Society. I make my living by helping corporations and industry associations plan intelligently for the future. I focus on North America, but deal with global issues. My Client list includes companies like Coca-Cola, Ford, IBM, Bell, the U.S. Navy Department of Medicine & Surgery, the National Research Council, the Clerk of the House of Commons of Canada, among many others.


The services I offer are tailored to the needs of the client, but fall into the following major areas: Keynote Speeches, Workshops and Seminars, and Innovation Sessions. Companies can also ask me to work with their planning groups on an on-going basis, or for a specific part of their planning cycle. I have also been asked to assess companies in which a client is considering making an investment, especially in technology companies where I may have some familiarity with the field.


Groups or companies wishing to know more about any of my services should contact me by e-mail at futurist@futuresearch.com or by phone at 1-416-489-4511.

Click here to use SpeakerTRACKER to subscribe and be notified by email the next time I'm in your area. You may be able to come see me speak or book an event for your organization.


I look forward to any feedback or questions you may have.




» Keynote Speeches





As part of a larger conference, I am often asked to make a keynote speech, typically to either kick off the conference and set the tone; or to end the conference, wrapping it up and sending the participants home with some specific thoughts to consider. Every speech is individually tailored to the needs of the conference in consultation with the client. I start this process by speaking with your conference planner or committee, either by phone or, if possible, in person.


From these notes, I prepare an extensive outline of my presentation about two weeks before the event, and email it to you for consideration and comment. Once I have your feedback on my presentation draft, I use them to focus my presentation even more tightly on the needs of the event.


I have testimonials in my files from clients going back several years. Contact me for more details. To see excerpts from testimonial letters from conference organizers and corporate sponsors who have used my services, see Clients & Testimonials.






» Workshops & Seminars





These can range from half a day to an entire weekend retreat. Under a general title of "Inventing the Future", I work with conferees to identify the major forces that will affect their companies as well as their personal lives, then help them identify the likely possibilities and the early warning signals they need to watch for. Next, we work through the major possible scenarios facing them the contingencies they need to prepare for and then work towards the contingency plans required.


Since each workshop must be different in order to fit the needs of a specific group, the results are as diverse as the groups themselves.






» Innovation Sessions





These are, by necessity, unique to each group. I did one project with a major communications group on the future of communications. This process lasted several months, with occassional meetings interspersed with periods of research and consultation. I also worked with a group of grade eight students from a public school, working with a corporate sponsor to teach them a number of brainstorming techniques and eliciting their ideas for the future. Both of these projects had very different planning cycles, and both had different end objectives.






» Futurist FAQ




What is a Futurist? Let's start by saying what a futurist is not.


A futurist is not someone who "tells the future". We don't read tea leaves, tarot cards, crystal balls, or tell fortunes. Those who confuse us with soothsayers have never had any dealings with a futurist.






» Future Studies





There is no one method for studying the future, although there are a number of tools that are used. Here are some random thoughts on future-related information and sites.






» Bibliography





People often ask me how I manage to stay up with all the things going on in the world today. The simple answer is that I don't, and I don't think that anyone can. However, it's fun trying, especially if you like reading. Included here is a partial listing of books that you may find useful.

Welcome to Futuresearch.com





People are fascinated by the future because it affects their lives, their jobs, and their wealth and welfare. And the future is a topic that fits every conference, and involves everyone in your organization. That's why Richard Worzel, Chartered Financial Analyst, best-selling author, and one of today's leading futurists, trend analysts, and innovation specialists, is in such demand as a speaker, consultant, and writer.


And although he's a top trend analyst, he has developed new tools to go beyond mere trend watching, including Pre-trending™, which identifies new trends as they emerge, and TrendVelocity™ analysis, which clarifies how and when things are likely to happen.


He conducts structured innovation sessions that dovetail into your strategic planning and product design, including proprietary innovation techniques, and brings a keen understanding of why innovation can be so difficult, and how organizations can unknowingly undermine their own innovation efforts. Part of this is a process Richard calls Inventing the Future. The results help an organization remake their approach to innovation, the marketplace, and tomorrow.


Richard makes compelling keynote speeches to set the table at the start of a conference, or can end it with a bang. He leads intriguing workshops that range from a couple of hours, to days or even months of strategic planning. And he can help you plan and prepare for our uncertain future.




» Keynote & Workshop Topics





I'm often asked what topics I speak on, so I've created an extensive list of subject areas within which I've created presentations or workshops in the past. Many of these descriptions were written by me for conference organizers to put into their conference brochures.




» Articles & Books





This area includes a collection of articles on various topics, as well as information on some of my other books and publications. You can subscribe to the Futurist-News Mailing List to receive occassional updates and new feature articles of note by email.

America’s new healthcare economy: 3 trends to watch | Fortune.comFortune InsidersSearchSearchFortune 500Amazon Has a New Way For You To Pick Up PackagesDonald TrumpPresident Trump Just Dumped His Chief of Staff Reince PriebusCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDOn LeadingThis Company Calls Itself the ‘Amazon of Real Estate’Photograph by Brian Snyder — ReutersCommentaryCommentaryAmerica’s new healthcare economy: 3 trends to watchBob MoritzJan 21, 2015In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama was brief but to the point on healthcare. Declaring that about “10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage” because of the Affordable Care Act, he made clear he would veto any legislative attempt to roll it back. Thus, absent judicial action, the Act is here to stay. Politics notwithstanding, this means the healthcare industry’s remarkable, ongoing transformation in the face of significant disruption will also continue.Simply put: government action combined with market forces is creating a business case study we should all be reading, even as it’s still being written.To be sure, healthcare is one of many industries facing significant disruption. In PwC’s recently published 18th Annual Global CEO Survey, U.S. CEOs identified various trends that they believe will be very disruptive for their industries. Overall, 60% agreed that their companies face more threats to their growth today than three years ago. At the same time, however, these CEOs see substantial potential amidst the disruption – 67% agreed that there are more growth opportunities today than three years ago.With this broader perspective in mind, let’s take a close look at the health sector.RelatedMost Powerful WomenNo, Women at the BBC Aren’t to Blame for Their Own Gender Pay GapMost Powerful WomenNo, Women at the BBC Aren’t to Blame for Their Own Gender Pay GapAt $2.9 trillion, the state of the U.S. healthcare industry is strong—and growing. In his speech, the president pointed out that health care inflation  is  at its lowest rate in 50 years. Those 10 million newly insured Americans are bringing in significant new revenue, but that’s only part of the story. The health sector is proving to be highly adaptive to disruption and innovation, while also evidencing how the public sector and private sector can join together to accelerate market forces beyond a rate anyone foresaw. Although consumers’ demands for greater roles in their healthcare decisions and purchasers’ demands for reduced costs existed pre-ACA, the landmark legislation turbo-charged these market forces.Three aspects stand out:First, the most startling metamorphosis over the last few years is the fast-paced transformation of health insurance into a true retail industry. The combination of the public and private exchanges, new market entrants and millions of new customers is fostering fierce competition over quality and price. The result is an industry that is increasingly responsive to its customers.Second, employer-provided insurance remains our nation’s health insurance bedrock, despite the alternatives offered by the ACA. With only some exceptions, employers continue to provide their employees with insurance and in many instances are the leading innovators in devising high-quality, lower-cost care.Third, employers and consumers, aided by the ACA’s incentives, are pushing the market to emphasize value and outcomes, compared with the outdated focus on volume. As a result, insurers are focused on health outcomes for patient populations, providers are changing how they care for patients and pharmaceutical and medical device companies are changing their investment and product development strategies. All the while, healthcare consumers are benefitting.It’s important to examine how industry players are driving these changes and what strategies current and future market actors will need. I want to highlight three key trends in the  new healthcare economy . Significantly, these topics are also on the front burner for U.S. CEOs in other sectors.First, partnerships are increasingly important to success. In  today’s  hyper-competitive environment, companies must collaborate on innovative products and services, combining complementary expertise to fill individual gaps. The Top Issues report reveals that 40% of Fortune 50 companies pursued new healthcare partnerships in 2014, and that 58% of consumers would be more likely to choose a healthcare company that partnered with others to improve services.Given my focus on healthcare today, there is one strikingly disappointing number – that only 28% of U.S. CEOs are engaged in or contemplating partnering with government. As a result of the Act, a significant part of healthcare today is government-private sector partnerships in different forms. The foremost examples are the public exchanges, in which private companies are competing in a government-established structure. Then, of course, there are hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and incentives that government is providing and that the private sector is using to innovate – to experiment with care delivery, develop new technology, study population health, and other areas.Second, digital technology is a crucial focus, now and for the future. For example, consumers want more do-it-yourself health options, and entrepreneurs are obliging. Rapid innovation is everywhere, from the growth of the wearables market to mobile apps to FDA-approved digital medical devices. Indeed, in the first 10 months of 2014 alone, the FDA cleared 24 of these devices.The heavy emphasis on digital technology is not unique to the healthcare industry. Eighty-eight percent of the U.S. CEOs we surveyed said digital technology was strategically important for data mining and analytics and 79% for customer engagement. Moreover, 85% said digital technology was creating value in operational efficiency and customer engagement.Third, securing consumer data and ensuring privacy will be central to healthcare companies’ successes. While the Top Issues report revealed that more than 50% of consumers would be willing to share data to improve care coordination and nearly 50% would do so to support real-time decision-making, privacy is a major concern. More than 65% of consumers said data security was more important to them than convenient access to imaging and test results, doctors’ notes, diagnoses and prescriptions.Not just business, but government and society writ large must do better to facilitate these partnerships—the health care industry illustrates how they can work. If all three increasingly step up to the plate in the health and other industries, the potential benefits are incredible.Bob Moritz is the chairman and senior partner of PwC.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
