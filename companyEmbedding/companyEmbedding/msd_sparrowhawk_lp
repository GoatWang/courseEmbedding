MSD Ignition is at the Forefront of Performance Ignition Technology
MSD doesn’t just manufacture ignitions and ignition system parts, they create them. They were the innovators of the first multiple-spark discharge ignition control box, and since that breakthrough they’ve continued to change the concepts of ignition by reengineering ignition boxes, billet distributors, ignition coils of all types, and plug wires. And they’re not done yet. MSD continues to improve their existing product line and develop innovative products.
The benefits of MSD are numerous:
Quick startsIncreased powerSmooth idleCrisp throttle responseWiring designed with you in mind: it's never been easier or better looking

Whether you are a weekend racer or a warrior on the race track, MSD has a quality ignition part for your vehicle. When you choose MSD, you’ll experience the benefits of improved performance and reliability in your ignition system..
