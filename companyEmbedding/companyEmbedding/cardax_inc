About Cardax (OTCQB: CDXI)
Cardax devotes substantially all of its efforts to developing safe anti-inflammatory dietary supplements and drugs. Cardax is initially focusing on astaxanthin, which is a powerful and safe naturally occurring anti-inflammatory without the side effects of currently marketed anti-inflammatories.
Cardax recently launched its first commercial product, ZanthoSyn™, a safe anti-inflammatory for general health. ZanthoSyn™ is a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity, and is available through Cardax’s commercial website, www.zanthosyn.com.
Astaxanthin use is supported by hundreds of peer-reviewed papers published in leading medical research journals. More than 50 human clinical trials supporting the safety and efficacy of astaxanthin have been conducted to date. As the broader scientific community has discovered the health benefits of astaxanthin, awareness and demand for astaxanthin has grown dramatically.
Cardax management and Board have strong operational and technical expertise in healthcare product development and astaxanthin science.
Our patents protect compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and pharmaceutical uses of astaxanthin and related products in key disease areas.
The safety and efficacy of our product candidates have not been directly evaluated in clinical trials or confirmed by the FDA.

Astaxanthin
History and Background










Astaxanthin in Nature
Astaxanthin is widely and naturally found in marine organisms, including microalgae, crustaceans, salmon, and trout. It’s the substance that gives these marine animals their distinct color.
Animals have adapted to exploit the health benefits of astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is believed to protect microalgae from environmental stress. Salmon accumulate astaxanthin from their diet and store it in their muscle tissue; astaxanthin is believed to protect salmon from oxidative stress when they swim upstream to spawn – a taxing and traumatic event.
Identification and Study
Richard Kuhn
In 1938, Richard Kuhn identified and isolated astaxanthin from lobster. Kuhn had setup a laboratory on the banks of the Neckar River in Germany and quickly established his reputation as a leading experimentalist in organic chemistry. Astaxanthin was one of the earliest carotenoids to be examined by the broader research community.
Noting that astaxanthin was found to improve animal health and vitality, further scientific study ensued. To date, over 1,000 peer-reviewed papers exploring astaxanthin have been published in scientific journals. More than 50 peer-reviewed papers have been published by Cardax team members, ten of which appeared in The American Journal of Cardiology.
Supplementation
Humans have been consuming a diverse array of sea life, including astaxanthin, for many thousands of years, but only recently have we been able to reap the benefits of astaxanthin through supplementation.
Agricultural production of astaxanthin typically comes from the following sources:

Krill: ~120 PPM astaxanthin
Arctic shrimp: ~1,200 PPM astaxanthin
Yeast (phaffia yeast): 10,000 PPM astaxanthin
Microalgae (Haematococcus pluvialis): ~40,000 PPM astaxanthin

Astaxanthin
Benefits of Use










Astaxanthin Overview
Astaxanthin is a potent and safe anti-inflammatory that can improve the health in humans and animals. Astaxanthin is proven to reduce inflammation at its source, without the harmful side effects of common anti-inflammatories and pain relievers.
Cardax’s pharmaceutical development program for astaxanthin will target conditions where inflammation is strongly implicated, including:

Osteoarthritis: Astaxanthin is well positioned to meet the needs of patients suffering from osteoarthritis. Astaxanthin reduces inflammation equivalent a steroid (in non-human tests), but is far safer than steroids, NSAIDs, or TNF-α inhibitors. Learn more >>
Metabolic Syndrome: Astaxanthin could decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In humans, astaxanthin has been shown to significantly lower bad cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides while simultaneously raising good cholesterol (HDL-C). Similarly, in animal models of disease, astaxanthin significantly decreased blood pressure and fasting glucose levels. Learn more >>
Other Conditions: Astaxanthin has the potential to treat a variety of conditions driven by inflammation. Learn more >>

Proof of Concept
Astaxanthin has demonstrated efficacy in models of inflammatory-mediated disease, including reduction of TNF-α levels equivalent to a steroid, reduction of liver enzymes and liver histological damage, reduction of cholesterol levels, reduction of elevated triglycerides, decrease of atheroma formation, reduction of oxidized-LDL levels, reduction in blood clot formation with no increase in bleeding, and decrease in myocardial tissue damage following experimentally-induced myocardial infarction.
1,200+ peer reviewed papers featuring astaxanthin have been published in leading scientific journals. Learn more >>
Mechanism of Action
Following oral administration of astaxanthin and intestinal uptake, astaxanthin is delivered initially to the liver via chylomicrons and subsequently distributed to tissues throughout the body via plasma lipoprotein particles including very low-density lipoprotein (“vLDL”), HDL, and LDL.
Once in the cell, astaxanthin accumulates within various organelles including nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial membranes. Localization within mitochondria is highly controlled by the cell and allows astaxanthin to uniquely regulate oxidative and nitrosative stress in a privileged location critical to normal metabolic function and often at the heart of metabolic dysfunction and aging. Due to its chemical structure, astaxanthin completely spans the lipid component of cell membranes, facilitating its biphasic (aqueous and lipid) anti-oxidant functions.
In support of the unique property of astaxanthin, one study examined X-ray diffraction profiles of five structurally related anti-oxidants embedded in a lipid matrix and demonstrated that each oriented differently with only astaxanthin traversing the lipid, potentially explaining, in part, why other well-known anti-oxidants, including beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, have not achieved greater clinical success.
In addition to mitochondrial influence, astaxanthin’s remarkable aqueous and lipid anti-oxidant functions have the capacity to influence intracellular inflammatory and metabolic pathway signaling because many important intracellular pathways are directly modulated by inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators.
In support of strong anti-oxidant function within the body, astaxanthin administration has demonstrated statistically significant anti-oxidant capacity in humans as measured by decreased isoprostanes, decreased malondialdehyde (“MDA”) levels, increased total anti-oxidant capacity (“TAC”), and increased superoxide dismutase (“SOD”), as well as decreased lipid peroxidation. Likewise, numerous animal studies have supported the extensive and powerful anti-oxidant capacity of astaxanthin in vivo. Many studies support the strong influence of astaxanthin on mitochondrial functionality, as well as inflammatory and metabolic intracellular signaling in animals and in cell-based models.
Astaxanthin vs. Steroids and NSAIDs
Most anti-inflammatory drugs target highly specific biological enzymes or receptors such as cyclooxygenase 2 (“COX-2”), TNF-α, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (“CCR2”). While these natural targets play a significant role in inflammation, they are also critical components of other important biological pathways. With chronic use of most anti-inflammatories, these pathways may not function normally, resulting in adverse side effects including immune system suppression, liver damage, cardiovascular disease risk, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
In contrast, astaxanthin safely reduces inflammation at its source, in that it:

Localizes in the plasma, mitochondrial, and nuclear membranes;
Scavenges or quenches the unwanted initiators and effectors of inflammation—reactive oxygen (“ROS”) and nitrogen species (“RNS”); and
Demonstrates no evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of steroids or TNF-α inhibitors or off-target effects (e.g., receptor or pathway).

Cardax Launches First Product ZanthoSyn™






Business Wire




Aug 24, 2016 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Cardax, Inc. ("Cardax") (OTCQB:CDXI) announced today that it has launched its first commercial product, ZanthoSyn ™, a safe anti-inflammatory for general health. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160824005311/en/  ZanthoSyn ™ is a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity, and is available through Cardax's commercial website, www.zanthosyn.com.  Astaxanthin is a clinically studied ingredient with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports joint health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and liver health. * The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn ™ has demonstrated excellent safety in peer-reviewed published studies and is designated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) according to FDA regulations.  Superior Absorption. In a head-to-head human study against a leading microalgal astaxanthin dietary supplement, ZanthoSyn ™ provided 2.85 times more absorption (p = 0.013)—defined as the total amount of astaxanthin measured in the bloodstream over a 24-hour period following a single 24 mg dose. This means that two 12 mg capsules of ZanthoSyn ™ deliver nearly the same amount of astaxanthin to the blood stream as six 12 mg capsules of microalgal astaxanthin. This study was sponsored by Cardax and led by Dr. Jon L. Ruckle, Cardax's lead medical advisor since 2013. Dr. Ruckle was the former Medical Director of the Covance Clinical Research Unit in Honolulu and has been a principal investigator of more than 350 clinical trials.  "These results demonstrate a highly significant and clinically meaningful advantage for ZanthoSyn," concluded Dr. Ruckle. "We were also pleased to see very consistent subject-to-subject absorption profiles."  Purity. ZanthoSyn ™ contains pure astaxanthin prepared by natural product total synthesis. In contrast, the astaxanthin extracted from microalgae is obtained in a complex mixture, which may include many unknown microalgal by-products. The precision of synthetic manufacturing also provides healthcare professionals and health-conscious consumers with confidence in the quality and consistency of dosing from every capsule. ZanthoSyn ™ is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for dietary supplements.  "We are very pleased to launch this exciting product," said David G. Watumull, President and CEO of Cardax. "Our team includes leading astaxanthin experts and is uniquely positioned to lead the roll-out of our commercialization strategy over the next several quarters."

(“Cardax”) (CDXI) announced today that it has launched its first commercial product, ZanthoSyn™, a safe anti-inflammatory for general health.This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160824005311/en/ ZanthoSyn™ is a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with superior absorption and purity, and is available through Cardax’s commercial website, www.zanthosyn.com.Astaxanthin is a clinically studied ingredient with safe anti-inflammatory activity that supports joint health, cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and liver health.* The form of astaxanthin utilized in ZanthoSyn™ has demonstrated excellent safety in peer-reviewed published studies and is designated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) according to FDA regulations.Superior Absorption. In a head-to-head human study against a leading microalgal astaxanthin dietary supplement, ZanthoSyn™ provided 2.85 times more absorption (p = 0.013)—defined as the total amount of astaxanthin measured in the bloodstream over a 24-hour period following a single 24 mg dose. This means that two 12 mg capsules of ZanthoSyn™ deliver nearly the same amount of astaxanthin to the blood stream as six 12 mg capsules of microalgal astaxanthin. This study was sponsored by Cardax and led by Dr. Jon L. Ruckle, Cardax’s lead medical advisor since 2013. Dr. Ruckle was the former Medical Director of the Covance Clinical Research Unit in Honolulu and has been a principal investigator of more than 350 clinical trials.“These results demonstrate a highly significant and clinically meaningful advantage for ZanthoSyn,” concluded Dr. Ruckle. “We were also pleased to see very consistent subject-to-subject absorption profiles.”Purity. ZanthoSyn™ contains pure astaxanthin prepared by natural product total synthesis. In contrast, the astaxanthin extracted from microalgae is obtained in a complex mixture, which may include many unknown microalgal by-products. The precision of synthetic manufacturing also provides healthcare professionals and health-conscious consumers with confidence in the quality and consistency of dosing from every capsule. ZanthoSyn™ is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for dietary supplements.“We are very pleased to launch this exciting product,” said David G. Watumull, President and CEO of Cardax. “Our team includes leading astaxanthin experts and is uniquely positioned to lead the roll-out of our commercialization strategy over the next several quarters.”“Based on astaxanthin’s published safety and efficacy data together with the superior absorption and purity of ZanthoSyn, I strongly recommend ZanthoSyn to those seeking a safe anti-inflammatory for their general health needs,” added Dr. Jon L. Ruckle.         * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.         About CardaxCardax devotes substantially all of its efforts to developing safe anti-inflammatory dietary supplements and drugs. Cardax is initially focusing on astaxanthin, which is a powerful and safe naturally occurring anti-inflammatory without the side effects of currently marketed anti-inflammatories.

HONOLULU--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cardax, Inc. (“Cardax”) (OTCQB:CDXI) announced today that it has 
      launched its first commercial product, ZanthoSyn™, a safe 
      anti-inflammatory for general health.
    


      ZanthoSyn™ is a novel astaxanthin dietary supplement with 
      superior absorption and purity, and is available through Cardax’s 
      commercial website, www.zanthosyn.com.
    

      Astaxanthin is a clinically studied ingredient with safe

      ZanthoSyn™ provided 2.85 times more absorption (p =

      meaningful advantage for ZanthoSyn,” concluded Dr. Ruckle. “We were also 
      pleased to see very consistent subject-to-subject absorption profiles.”
