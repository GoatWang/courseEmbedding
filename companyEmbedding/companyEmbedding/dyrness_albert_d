Mr. Dyrness co-founded ADVENT Engineering Services, Inc., a privately held engineering consulting firm, in 1988, and since that time, he has served in several roles, most recently as the Principal and Managing Director of the Life Sciences Division since 1995. Mr. Dryness is a recognized industry leader in bio-process engineering, with expertise in upstream, downstream and fill-finish processes, member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Bioprocess Equipment Standard, or ASME BPE, and has served as the Vice Chairperson for the ASME BPE System Design subcommittee since 2013. Mr. Dyrness is also an Industrial Advisory Board Member of the University of the Pacific's Bioengineering program. Mr. Dyrness received an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and holds professional engineering licenses in the State of California for both Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. We believe Mr. Dyrness' experience in the design, start-up and qualification of systems, and equipment used for producing and developing biologics and pharmaceutics, as well as in the life sciences sector, qualifies him to serve on our board of directors.
