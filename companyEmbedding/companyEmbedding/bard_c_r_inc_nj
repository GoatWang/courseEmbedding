Overview[edit]
Bard markets its products and services worldwide to hospitals, individual health care professionals, extended care facilities, and alternate site facilities. An S&P 500 company with approximately 14,000 employees in 2015, Bard is perhaps best known for having introduced the Foley catheter in 1934.[citation needed] In 2013, Bard began negotiations to settle nearly 30,000 legal claims related to implantable vaginal meshes made by the company.[5]
History[edit]
C. R. Bard, Inc. was founded in New York City by Charles R. Bard in 1907. Bard's first business involved importing Gomenol, which was used to treat urinary discomfort.[6] The company formally incorporated in 1923, and three years later, in 1926, Charles R. Bard sold the company to John F. Willits and Edson L. Outwin for $18,000. Under Willits and Outwins, the company expanded into the catheter business, introducing the Foley catheter in 1934 and the America Woven Catheter in 1940.
In 1948, Bard's annual sales topped $1 million for the first time, and the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Summit, New Jersey. In 1954, a Bard scientist, Dr. DeBakey, developed the first arterial prosthesis.[citation needed] Three years later the company began selling Foley catheters that came in sterile packaging for the first time ever. Bard continued to innovate in the world of catheters, rolling out the Bipolar Temporary Pacing catheter in 1958 and the first latex balloon catheter in 1960. In 1961, Bard expanded beyond catheters, and began manufacturing products related to cardiology, radiology, and anesthesiology.
Bard went public in 1963 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1968. The company has introduced a variety of new health care products since that time. Its net sales first exceeded $1 billion in 1994. Around 2012, Bard acquired the company Lutonix.[7]
On April 23, 2017, it was announced that Bard would be bought by Becton Dickinson for $24 billion.
Products[edit]
Bard specializes in the manufacturing of vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.
Illegal kickback settlement[edit]
In 2013, Bard agreed to pay $48.26 million to resolve kickback allegations filed against the company, relating to submitting false claims to Medicare. The complaint, filed in 2006, alleges Bard paid illegal kickbacks to both physicians and consumers.[8]
Vaginal mesh device lawsuits[edit]
Vaginal mesh devices are threaded into the vagina to treat incontinence or to fortify pelvic muscles. Some women have charged that the devices "are poorly designed and contain materials that are unsafe for use in humans [and that] some require multiple surgeries to remove."[9] In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested that Bard and other vaginal-mesh makers study rates of organ damage linked to the mesh devices. In 2013, Bard began negotiations to settle nearly 30,000 legal claims related to implantable vaginal meshes made by the company.[5] In August 2015 it was announced that Bard had agreed to pay more than $200 million to resolve at least 3,000 of the legal cases related to the devices. The settlement resolves about one-fifth of the outstanding suits related to the implants. Bard said in court filings its devices are "safe and effective."[9]
Bard vena cava filter[edit]
An Inferior vena cava filter, or more simply, a blood clot filter, is a device that is surgically placed in the vena cava artery to prevent blood clots from moving into the heart or lungs, which can be fatal. On December 31, 2015, NBC News released information about an investigation that they had conducted of the Bard G2 series filters which had replaced an earlier version, the Recovery filter. Introduced in 2002, the Recovery filter was associated with 27 deaths and several hundred non-fatal problems, and "a confidential study commissioned by Bard showed that the Recovery filter had higher rates of relative risk for death, filter fracture and movement than all of its competitors." However, according to the NBC report, the G2 series filters were a modified version of the Recovery filter and Bard was aware that it had "similar and potentially fatal flaws" shortly after it was put on the market. But instead of recalling the replacement filters, they were kept on the market for five years. According to Bard and FDA records, at least 12 deaths and hundreds of problems have been linked to the G2 series filters.[10]

Overview[edit]
Bard markets its products and services worldwide to hospitals, individual health care professionals, extended care facilities, and alternate site facilities. An S&P 500 company with approximately 14,000 employees in 2015, Bard is perhaps best known for having introduced the Foley catheter in 1934.[citation needed] In 2013, Bard began negotiations to settle nearly 30,000 legal claims related to implantable vaginal meshes made by the company.[5]
History[edit]
C. R. Bard, Inc. was founded in New York City by Charles R. Bard in 1907. Bard's first business involved importing Gomenol, which was used to treat urinary discomfort.[6] The company formally incorporated in 1923, and three years later, in 1926, Charles R. Bard sold the company to John F. Willits and Edson L. Outwin for $18,000. Under Willits and Outwins, the company expanded into the catheter business, introducing the Foley catheter in 1934 and the America Woven Catheter in 1940.
In 1948, Bard's annual sales topped $1 million for the first time, and the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Summit, New Jersey. In 1954, a Bard scientist, Dr. DeBakey, developed the first arterial prosthesis.[citation needed] Three years later the company began selling Foley catheters that came in sterile packaging for the first time ever. Bard continued to innovate in the world of catheters, rolling out the Bipolar Temporary Pacing catheter in 1958 and the first latex balloon catheter in 1960. In 1961, Bard expanded beyond catheters, and began manufacturing products related to cardiology, radiology, and anesthesiology.
Bard went public in 1963 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1968. The company has introduced a variety of new health care products since that time. Its net sales first exceeded $1 billion in 1994. Around 2012, Bard acquired the company Lutonix.[7]
On April 23, 2017, it was announced that Bard would be bought by Becton Dickinson for $24 billion.
Products[edit]
Bard specializes in the manufacturing of vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.
Illegal kickback settlement[edit]
In 2013, Bard agreed to pay $48.26 million to resolve kickback allegations filed against the company, relating to submitting false claims to Medicare. The complaint, filed in 2006, alleges Bard paid illegal kickbacks to both physicians and consumers.[8]
Vaginal mesh device lawsuits[edit]
Vaginal mesh devices are threaded into the vagina to treat incontinence or to fortify pelvic muscles. Some women have charged that the devices "are poorly designed and contain materials that are unsafe for use in humans [and that] some require multiple surgeries to remove."[9] In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested that Bard and other vaginal-mesh makers study rates of organ damage linked to the mesh devices. In 2013, Bard began negotiations to settle nearly 30,000 legal claims related to implantable vaginal meshes made by the company.[5] In August 2015 it was announced that Bard had agreed to pay more than $200 million to resolve at least 3,000 of the legal cases related to the devices. The settlement resolves about one-fifth of the outstanding suits related to the implants. Bard said in court filings its devices are "safe and effective."[9]
Bard vena cava filter[edit]
An Inferior vena cava filter, or more simply, a blood clot filter, is a device that is surgically placed in the vena cava artery to prevent blood clots from moving into the heart or lungs, which can be fatal. On December 31, 2015, NBC News released information about an investigation that they had conducted of the Bard G2 series filters which had replaced an earlier version, the Recovery filter. Introduced in 2002, the Recovery filter was associated with 27 deaths and several hundred non-fatal problems, and "a confidential study commissioned by Bard showed that the Recovery filter had higher rates of relative risk for death, filter fracture and movement than all of its competitors." However, according to the NBC report, the G2 series filters were a modified version of the Recovery filter and Bard was aware that it had "similar and potentially fatal flaws" shortly after it was put on the market. But instead of recalling the replacement filters, they were kept on the market for five years. According to Bard and FDA records, at least 12 deaths and hundreds of problems have been linked to the G2 series filters.[10]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see "Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information" below.  Overview  The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe and Japan are the company's largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are the company's fastest growing markets. In general, the company's products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product group categories:  The company's earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bard's ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2013, the company's research and development ("R&D") expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.7%. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consider acquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $498.5 million in 2013, including acquired in-process R&D ("IPR&D"), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.  Acquisitions, Divestiture and Legal Developments  Acquisitions  On November 14, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rochester Medical, Inc. ("Rochester Medical"), a publicly-held developer and supplier of silicone urinary incontinence and urine drainage products for a purchase price of $262.3 million. Rochester Medical's products expand Bard's existing global urology product portfolio including an intermittent self catheter product line as well as other products used to treat male urinary incontinence.  On October 1, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Medafor, Inc. ("Medafor"), a privately-held developer and supplier of plant-based hemostatic agents. Medafor's Arista(R) AH hemostat products provide an alternative to other commercially available hemostats, complement Bard's Progel(R)surgical sealant technology and allow the company to expand its presence in the global surgical hemostat market segment. The total purchase consideration of $206.3 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $80.0 million, which is based on specific revenue-based milestones through June 30, 2015.  On August 29, 2013, the company acquired early-stage technology from 3DT Holdings LLC ("3DT"), providing the company with the rights to develop and commercialize a novel technology related to peripherally inserted central catheters ("PICCs"). 3DT received an up-front cash payment of $29.5 million and is eligible for a milestone payment of up to $5.0 million based upon regulatory product approval. The company recorded the up-front payment as a research and development expense.  II-3  Table of Contents  On July 29, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Loma Vista Medical, Inc., a privately-held company specializing in the development and commercialization of aortic valvuloplasty products, which use noncompliant fiber-based balloon technology. The total purchase consideration of $39.4 million included an up-front cash payment of $32.5 million and the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $8.0 million.  For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.  Divestiture  On November 1, 2013, the company closed on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its electrophysiology division (the "EP Sale") to Boston Scientific Corporation ("Boston Scientific") and received net cash proceeds of $267.4 million. The company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a gain on the sale of $213.0 million ($118.5 million after tax). See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.  Legal Developments  In connection with the company's ongoing suit against W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. ("Gore") for infringing Bard's patent number 6,436,135, and in accordance with Bard's motion to execute on the judgment regarding the final and non-appealable issues, which the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona ("District Court") granted on October 17, 2013, Bard and Gore jointly submitted an order to the District Court directing that all funds not related to Gore's willful infringement be paid to Bard. On November 1, 2013, Gore paid the company $894.3 million in cash (the "Gore Proceeds"), which amount represented the compensatory damages for infringement, including pre- and post-judgment interest, and the royalties accrued through September 30, 2013. In the fourth quarter 2013, the company recorded a gain of $894.3 million ($557.4 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on the District Court's October 17, 2013 rulings and the company's receipt of the Gore Proceeds. In addition, in January 2014, the company received $37.6 million from Gore, representing Gore's calculation of royalties for its infringing sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. This royalty payment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2014.  During 2013, the company evaluated certain product liability matters based on information currently available, including: the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the company; and the procedural posture and stage of litigation. Based on these, and other factors, the company recorded charges, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net of approximately $400.7 million ($367.6 million after tax), which recognized the estimated costs for certain product liability, including (with respect to such matters) asserted and unasserted claims, as well as costs to administer the settlements related to such matters. The charges exclude any costs associated with all but one putative class action lawsuit against the company.  For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.  Healthcare Reform  Significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "PPACA"). The PPACA requires, among other things, the company to pay a 2.3% excise tax on most U.S. medical device sales beginning in 2013. During 2013, the company recorded to marketing, selling and administration expense an excise tax of $29.4 million.  II-4  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Net Sales  Bard's 2013 consolidated net sales increased 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis over 2012 consolidated net sales. Bard's 2012 consolidated net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) over 2011 consolidated net sales. Net sales "on a constant currency basis" is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See "Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures" below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 100 basis points and 140 basis points for 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the company's hedging activities.  Bard's 2013 United States net sales of $2,014.1 million increased 2% compared to $1,967.7 million in 2012. Bard's 2013 international net sales of $1,035.4 million increased 5% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to $990.4 million in 2012. Bard's 2012 United States net sales increased 1% compared to $1,956.0 million in 2011. Bard's 2012 international net sales increased 5% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $940.4 million in 2011.  Presented below is a summary of consolidated net sales by product group category.   Product Group Summary of Net Sales For the Years Ended December 31, Constant Constant 2013 2012 Change Currency 2011 Change Currency (dollars in millions) Vascular $ 830.0 $ 845.0 (2 )% (2 )% $ 842.4 - 3 % Urology 776.6 757.8 2 % 3 % 734.8 3 % 4 % Oncology 857.1 812.4 6 % 5 % 779.5 4 % 5 % Surgical Specialties 499.0 455.1 10 % 10 % 450.0 1 % 2 % Other 86.8 87.8 (1 )% (1 )% 89.7 (2 )% (2 )% Total net sales $ 3,049.5 $ 2,958.1 3 % 3 % $ 2,896.4 2 % 3 %  Vascular Products - Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market, including endovascular products, and vascular graft products. In November 2013, Bard sold its electrophysiology division to Boston Scientific, retaining only the guidewire and temporary pacing electrode product lines. Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2013 decreased 2% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year due to decreases in sales of electrophysiology and vascular graft products. United States net sales of vascular products in 2013 decreased 3% compared to the prior year. International net sales of vascular products in 2013 were flat on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2012 were flat on a reported basis (increased 3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year was due to an increase in sales of endovascular products offset by declines in sales of electrophysiology and vascular graft products. United States net sales of vascular products in 2012 decreased 3% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2012 increased 4% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.  Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2013 were flat on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in this product line were impacted by growth in sales of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ("PTA") balloon catheters, vena cava filters and biopsy products  II-5  Table of Contents  offset by a decline in sales of stents. Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2012 increased 2% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Stents and PTA balloon catheters were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2012. Net sales of stents in 2012 benefited from an issue with the availability of a competitor's products.  Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2013 decreased 8% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of the electrophysiology division in November 2013. Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.  Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2013 decreased 5% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Declining sales in peripheral vascular grafts was the primary driver of the decrease in both 2013 and 2012.  Urology Products - Bard markets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. Bard also markets StatLock(R) catheter stabilization products, which are used to secure many types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies. Bard also markets Targeted Temperature Management(TM) products for therapeutic hypothermia. In November 2013, Bard acquired Rochester Medical, including their intermittent and male-external catheter product lines. In 2013, consolidated net sales of urology products increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Sales from the acquired product lines had a nominal impact on sales growth for 2013 on a reported basis, and contributed 1 percentage point of growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Net sales were also favorably impacted by growth in sales of Targeted Temperature Management(TM) products and basic drainage products. These increases were partially offset by declines in sales of continence products, a trend that may continue, and StatLock(R) catheter stabilization products. United States net sales of urology products in 2013 increased 1% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2013 increased 6% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of urology products in 2012 increased 3% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year due to an increase in net sales of Targeted Temperature Management(TM) products, partially offset by declines in sales of urological specialty products, StatLock(R) catheter stabilization products and continence products. United States net sales in 2012 increased 2% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2012 increased 6% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales of infection control Foley catheter products in 2012 decreased 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year.  Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products, including brachytherapy products, in 2013 were flat on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products in 2013 decreased 1% on a reported basis (flat on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products in 2012 decreased 15% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The brachytherapy market has been losing procedural share to alternative therapies in the United States, a trend that may continue.  Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2013 decreased 7% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2012 decreased 8%  II-6  Table of Contents  on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in 2013 and 2012 were impacted by a decline in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that may continue. Net sales in 2012 were also impacted by the discontinuation of sales of a bulking continence product.  Consolidated net sales of the StatLock(R) catheter stabilization product line in 2013 decreased 2% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of the StatLock(R) catheter stabilization product line in 2012 decreased 2% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales of soft tissue repair products in 2012 increased 1% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in this product line in 2012 were favorably impacted by growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and natural-tissue breast reconstruction implants, partially offset by declines in natural tissue hernia repair implants and hernia fixation products.  Other Products - The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain original equipment manufacturers' products.  Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the following years ended December 31: 2013(A) 2012 2011 Cost of goods sold 39.2 % 38.0 % 37.9 % Marketing, selling and administrative expense 30.2 % 27.6 % 27.4 % Research and development expense 9.7 % 6.9 % 6.4 % Interest expense 1.5 % 1.3 % 1.3 % Other (income) expense, net (20.3 )% 1.4 % 9.4 % Total costs and expenses 60.2 % 75.2 % 82.4 %  (A) Amounts do not add due to rounding.  Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the company's products. The category also includes royalties, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of certain hedging activities. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year. These costs as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to decreases in selling prices and an increase in spending for targeted investments. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2012 and 2013 increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2011 and 2012 increased cost of goods sold in 2012 as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points over the prior year. These increases were largely offset by cost improvements.  Marketing, selling and administrative expense - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the company's sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 260 basis points from the prior year primarily due to the new excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices, targeted investment spending in this area including in emerging markets, and related costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 20 basis points from the prior year primarily due to costs from operations acquired in 2011 and continued investments in emerging markets.  Research and development expense- Research and development expense consists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and IPR&D costs arising from the company's business development activities. IPR&D  II-8  Table of Contents  payments may impact the comparability of the company's results of operations between periods. The following table presents a summary of research and development expense for the following years ended December 31:   2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Research and development $ 262.3 $ 199.7 $ 181.9 In-process research and development 33.4 3.5 3.5 Total research and development expense $ 295.7 $ 203.2 $ 185.4  Research and development expense in 2013 increased approximately 31% compared to the prior year period primarily due to targeted investments in this area and costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. The increase in IPR&D in 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to charges of $30.0 million related to the acquisition of early-stage technology and $3.4 million for an impairment charge related to an IPR&D project. Research and development expense in 2012 increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year driven by the operations of acquisitions.  Interest expense - Interest expense in 2013 was $45.0 million as compared with . . .  Feb 19, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "company" or "Bard"). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Bard's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see "Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information" below.  Overview  The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care health facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe, Japan and China are the company's largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe are the company's fastest-growing markets. In general, the company's products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular; urology; oncology; and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.  The company's earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bard's ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the company's research and development ("R&D") expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.5%. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may from time-to-time consider acquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons.  Recent Developments  Becton Dickinson Transaction  On April 23, 2017, Bard entered into Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD") and Lambda Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BD ("Merger Corp"), pursuant to which Bard will merge with Merger Corp and become a wholly owned subsidiary of BD (the "Merger"). Under the agreement, each outstanding share of common stock of Bard will be converted into the right to receive $222.93 in cash and 0.5077 of a share of common stock of BD, as may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, (1) the approval of the Merger Agreement by a majority of the votes cast by Bard's shareholders at a special meeting held to vote on the Merger Agreement, among other items, (2) declaration of the effectiveness by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by BD in connection with the shares of the stock of BD to be issued in the Merger, (3) approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the stock of BD to be issued in the Merger, (4) obtaining antitrust approvals in the United States and certain other jurisdictions,  Results of Operations  Net Sales  Bard's consolidated net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 7% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) compared to the same period in the prior year. Net sales "on a constant currency basis" is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See "Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures" below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately 30 basis points as compared to the same period in the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately one percentage point, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary exchange rate movements that impacted net sales were the movement of the British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The  Table of Contents  impact of exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the company's hedging activities.  Bard's United States net sales of $657.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% compared to $625.4 million in the prior year quarter. International net sales of $281.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 14% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to $248.1 million in the prior year quarter.  A summary of net sales by product group category is as follows:  Product Group Summary of Net Sales   Three Months Ended March 31, Constant 2017 2016 Change Currency (dollars in millions) Vascular $ 256.6 $ 239.5 7 % 8 % Urology 237.7 216.7 10 % 11 % Oncology 255.5 241.9 6 % 6 % Surgical Specialties 165.1 151.4 9 % 9 % Other 23.9 24.0 - 2 % Total net sales $ 938.8 $ 873.5 7 % 8 %  Vascular Products - Bard markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market, including endovascular products and vascular graft products. Also included within vascular products are royalty payments from W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. ("Gore"), which will end in 2019. Consolidated net sales of vascular products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 7% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales of endovascular products. United States net sales of vascular products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. International net sales of vascular products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 11% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.

Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 decreased 4% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.  Urology Products - Bard markets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic urology drainage products, fecal and urinary continence products and urological specialty products. Bard also markets StatLock(R) catheter stabilization products, which are used to secure many types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies, as well as Targeted Temperature Management(TM) products, which are used for therapeutic hypothermia. Consolidated net sales of urology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 10% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter. This increase includes 6 percentage points of growth on both a reported basis and constant currency basis from the impact of selling inventory acquired in the Medicon, Inc. ("Medicon") acquisition during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which was recorded as sales into the joint venture prior to the acquisition. Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were also favorably impacted by growth in sales of basic drainage products, urological specialty products and StatLock(R) catheter stabilization products. These increases were partially offset by a decline in continence products. United States net sales of urology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 6% compared to the prior year quarter. International net sales of urology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 21% on a reported basis (26% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.  Consolidated net sales of basic drainage products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 16% on a reported basis (17% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.

Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.  Table of Contents  Consolidated net sales of continence products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 decreased 6% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that is expected to continue.  Consolidated net sales of the StatLock(R) catheter stabilization product line for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter.  Oncology Products - Bard's oncology business includes specialty vascular access products and enteral feeding devices. Specialty vascular access products include peripherally inserted central catheters ("PICCs") used for intermediate to long-term central venous access, specialty access ports and accessories ("Ports") used most commonly for chemotherapy, dialysis access catheters and vascular access ultrasound devices, which help facilitate the placement of PICCs. Consolidated net sales of oncology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 6% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales of PICCs. United States net sales of oncology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. International net sales of oncology products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 8% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter.

Surgical Specialty Products- Surgical specialty products include soft tissue repair products, performance irrigation devices and biosurgery products, including hemostats and sealants. Consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 9% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and was partially offset by declines in sales of natural hernia repair products. United States net sales of surgical specialty products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. International net sales of surgical specialty products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 22% on a reported basis (25% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year quarter. International net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 reflected increases in biosurgery products and synthetic hernia repair products.  The soft tissue repair product line includes synthetic and natural tissue hernia repair implants, natural tissue breast reconstruction implants and hernia fixation products. Consolidated net sales of soft tissue repair products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 11% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. Net sales in this product line were favorably impacted by growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and hernia fixation products and were partially offset by declines in sales of natural tissue hernia repair products, a trend that may continue.  Consolidated net sales of biosurgery products for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. Net sales in the product line were favorably impacted by growth in sales of hemostats. This increase was partially offset by a decline in surgical sealants due to a supply issue that is expected to be resolved in 2017.  Other Products - The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain original equipment manufacturers' products.  Table of Contents  Costs and Expenses A summary of costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016(A) Cost of goods sold 37.7 % 36.7 % Marketing, selling and administrative expense 30.4 % 31.0 % Research and development expense 7.5 % 7.8 % Interest expense 1.6 % 1.3 % Other (income) expense, net 1.3 % 6.9 % Total costs and expenses 78.5 % 83.6 %  (A) Amounts do not add due to rounding.  Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the company's products. The category also includes royalties paid by the company, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of certain hedging activities. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included the recognition of previously deferred profit on product shipments to the Medicon joint venture prior to its acquisition and the reversal of liabilities with respect to certain revenue-based and manufacturing-related milestones.  Marketing, selling and administrative expense - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the company's sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.  Research and development expense - Research and development expense consists principally of costs related to internal research and development activities, third-party research and development activities, and acquired in-process R&D ("IPR&D") arising from the company's business development activities. IPR&D costs may impact the comparability of the company's results of operations between periods. Research and development expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $70.0 million, an increase of approximately 2% compared to the prior year quarter.  Interest expense - Interest expense was $15.1 million and $11.3 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 is primarily due to the May 2016 issuance of fixed-rate notes and the impact from the amortization of the related forward-starting interest rate swap.  Other (income) expense, net - The components of other (income) expense, net, are as follows:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ (0.7 ) $ (0.3 ) Foreign exchange gains (1.6 ) (1.9 ) Litigation charges 12.2 48.9 Restructuring and productivity initiative costs 2.7 9.8 Acquisition-related items 0.2 3.7 Other, net (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Total other (income) expense, net $ 12.6 $ 60.0  Litigation charges, net - For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the amount reflects a charge for Civil Investigative Demands received from a number of State Attorneys General and litigation-related defense costs of $4.7 million in connection with the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia's pre-trial order to prepare 540 individual cases for trial. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the amount reflects the estimated costs for product liability matters. See Note 7 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.  Table of Contents  Restructuring and productivity initiative costs - For the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the amounts primarily reflect costs incurred in connection with productivity initiatives to optimize and streamline certain manufacturing and administrative functions to better align resources to the company's business strategies. Key activities under these initiatives may include systems enhancements, the implementation of shared services centers designed to standardize and centralize processes or the outsourcing of certain services. Productivity initiative costs include consulting costs, primarily related to program creation and management, employee separation costs under the company's existing severance program, and other related costs.  Acquisition-related items - For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the amount primarily consists of purchase accounting adjustments. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the amount primarily consists of acquisition-related integration costs.  Income Tax Provision  The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 11.6%. As discussed in Note 1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, the company adopted an accounting standard update that resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits to the income tax provision upon settlement of share-based compensation awards. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 reflected a benefit of $27.0 million partially offset by the discrete tax effects of litigation charges.  The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 was 18.7% which reflected the discrete tax effects of litigation charges related to product liability claims, which were incurred in a high tax jurisdiction. See Note 7 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.  Net Income and Earnings Per Share Available to Common Shareholders  The company reported net income and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $178.1 million and $2.37, respectively. Net income and diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders for the prior year quarter were $116.2 million and $1.54, respectively. The current year quarter reflects amortization of intangible assets of $21.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, litigation charges of $12.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, charges from acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of transaction costs and integration costs) of $2.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and restructuring and productivity initiative costs of $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. The prior year quarter reflects litigation charges of $30.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $21.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, restructuring and productivity initiative costs of $6.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, and net charges from acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments) of $2.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financial flexibility. A summary of certain liquidity measures for the company as of March 31, is as follows:   2017 2016 (dollars in millions) Working capital $ 741.1 $ 681.3 Current ratio 1.48/1 1.49/1  Cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries were $888.0 million and $806.0 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. It is the company's intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the company's plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the company's committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.  Table of Contents  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $140.6 million and $67.2 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a settlement payment pursuant to an agreement with Medtronic plc in the prior year period (see Note 7 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements). This increase was partially offset by higher payments to claimants for certain product liability matters in the current year period.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used by investing activities was $28.3 million and $223.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were approximately $22.7 million and $20.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The company spent $5.6 million and $203.0 million for the acquisition of businesses, products and technology to augment existing product lines for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used for financing activities was $150.8 million compared to the $102.6 million provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Total debt was $1.8 billion (including current maturities of $499.3 million) and $1.6 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 51.2% and 49.5% at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The three months ended March 31, 2016 reflects the redemption of $250 million of fixed-rate debt. Net cash used in financing activities also reflects $232.3 million used to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $167.4 million to repurchase 897,004 shares of common stock in the prior year period. The company paid cash dividends of $0.26 per share and $0.24 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The company maintains a $1.0 billion five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that expires in November 2021. The credit facility supports the company's commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the company's long-term credit ratings and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At March 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with this covenant. The company had commercial paper borrowings outstanding of $110.0 million at March 31, 2017. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016.  Contingencies  In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, contractual disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions.
