On March 21, 2016, AEPS purchased several AmiciMPTS 225 Amp units for installation at properties in California and Mexico. AEPS has added AmiciMPTS to its energy efficiency solution offerings, which AEPS believes, in combination with its other products, will provide its customers with an unprecedented opportunity to reduce energy consumption, to maximize cost savings, and to further minimize carbon emissions.
"When we saw a demonstration of AmiciMPTS at a technology workshop at the College of the Canyons in early March, we were amazed by its ability to instantly reduce the consumption of Amps," said Paul Konapelsky, Managing Partner, American Energy Performance Solutions at AEPS. "We quickly researched the AmiciMPTS technology, found it to be the most scientifically advanced in our industry, and acted immediately to enter into a sales representation agreement with Amici Enterprises. Our first couple of sales of AmiciMPTS happened almost immediately and we have great expectations for a significant quantity of future sales."
"We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with AEPS and look forward to working closely with them in their representation of AmiciMPTS in the Americas," said Joshua Macciello, Managing Member of Amici Enterprises, LLC.
