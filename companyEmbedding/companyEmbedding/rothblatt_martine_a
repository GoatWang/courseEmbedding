Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]

The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

The 60-year-old grandmother and CEO of United Therapeutics, the Silver Spring-based biotech she founded to help save her younger daughter’s life, banked $38 million last year. It made her the nation’s highest-paid female executive. It also made her the nation’s highest-paid transgendered person, as she had sex reassignment surgery in 1994. In a lab on Spring Street, Rothblatt’s newest project appears lifted from science fiction: disembodied but breathing human lungs, hissing away in dome-shaped incubators, part of a clinical trial attempting to mend donated but not-quite-accepted-for-transplant lungs so that they can actually be placed in living human beings.  On a Virginia farm, she’s also raising genetically altered pigs, in the hope that someday their lungs (and other organs) will be modified for use in human transplant, creating a nearly inexhaustible supply of organ donors. She just published “Virtually Human,” a big-think manifesto on the rights of yet-to-be-created cyber-humans, who might one day be uploaded with all of your thoughts, dreams, memories and online activity and live for eternity as a sort-of you. She founded a religion, the Terasem Movement, which puts together her cultural Judaism (she puts on a mean seder), Zen-like yoga and a deep belief in technology. One of the four founding beliefs: “Death is optional.”  The physical manifestation of this faith is a bodyless robot, named and modeled after Rothblatt’s second wife, Bina. The robot, Bina48, is just a head. It has a face made of frubber, wears a good-looking wig, has facial-scanning software in her “eyes,” so that when her head whirs and clicks, then locks on your face, she’s running your profile to see if she “knows” you. Bina48 lives on a desk in rural Vermont, awaiting the day when man and machine are one. Far-fetched? Hey, go ahead, yuk it up. Rothblatt is buddies with Larry Page and Ray Kurzweil, who sort of run a little company called Google. Kurzweil, the futurist and director of engineering at Google, is on United Therapeutics’ board of directors and thinks Bina48 is a glimpse of the future.  In the late 1980s, Rothblatt conceived of and created a crazy company devoted to the idea of worldwide satellite radio. Today that’s Sirius XM. It’s in your car’s dashboard, next to the satellite navigation device ... and she was president of Geostar, the first company to market that, too. Her college thesis became the first private satellite phone company.  “She has to my knowledge a perfect track record in making [her] visions real,” Kurzweil writes in an e-mail. Rothblatt dropped out of the satellite orbit because her and Bina’s daughter was diagnosed at 5 with what is now called pulmonary arterial hypertension, an incurable lung disease. It progressively narrows the lung’s arteries to the point of death. By 12, Jenesis would faint all the time, her life seeping away in intensive care units.  So Rothblatt sold out of Sirius, set to studying biology — the last such course she had taken was in 10th grade — and formed U.T.  Today, Jenesis is 30, in good health and does film-production work for the now-$6 billion firm. Martine led the company to developing a new FDA-approved pill for pulmonary arterial hypertension, Orenitram (“Martine Ro,” backward). The stock price soared, and so did her incentive package.  Amid all this, Martine and Bina have been married for 32 years, before and after Rothblatt’s gender surgery. They’re so joined at the hip that the kids refer to them as “Marbina.” Their younger son, Gabriel, just ran for Congress in Florida’s Eighth District (Democrat, lost, but a respectable debut). When Rothblatt set up a $225,000 super PAC to fund Gabriel’s campaign — without his knowledge, he says — she drew a rebuke from the New York Times editorial page for parental abuse of electoral process.  Let’s see ... what else? She flies airplanes. And helicopters. Kills on the piano. Runs half-triathlons. Has several houses and apartments and says she hasn’t stayed in one place more than a month in 20 years. During September and October, she and Bina touched down in Greece, Crete, Washington, Los Angeles, Bora Bora, back to Silver Spring, took the grandkids trick-or-treating in Melbourne Beach, Fla., while Gabriel was out campaigning, then flew to London and popped back to D.C.  Oh. She’s taller than you, too.          1 of 12       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                             Skip Ad   ×           The genius of Silver Spring      View Photos   Martine Rothblatt bends space, biomedicine and the mysteries of love    Caption   Martine Rothblatt bends space, biomedicine and the mysteries of love    Martine Rothblatt, 60, founded SiriusXM satellite radio, a religion and a biotech. André Chung/For The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.              You’ve heard this one a million times: Idealistic Young Lawyer Comes to Your Nation’s Capital to Make a Difference and Gets Kicked in the Teeth. With Rothblatt, it’s the real story.  She — he, then — joined Covington and Burling in 1981 as an entry-level policy wonk in telcom law. She was 27 and already on a second marriage with two kids and two more on the way. The young couple was scraping by, living in a one-bedroom flat near the National Zoo.   Idealistic Young Lawyer went nowhere at Covington. When I called the firm recently to chat with someone who remembered her work there ... no one did. “They wanted me to lobby for broadcasters against the beginnings of satellite radio,” Rothblatt offers, “and I was all for the other team.” She quit after 12 months and enrolled in the graduate astronomy program at the University of Maryland. Mom, Dad and the kids piled into married student housing. This slightly idealistic poverty was nothing new. Rothblatt was born in Chicago, raised in San Diego and Los Angeles, the grandchild of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Dad Harold worked as a dentist at a labor union, and mother Rosa Lee worked as a speech therapist.  Marty, as Rothblatt was called, and a sister, Janet, were the only children in a household that believed in faith, decency and hard work. “There was no cursing, not even ‘damn,’ and the children were expected to be courteous,” says Rosa Lee Rothblatt, now retired and living just outside Los Angeles in a house with Bina’s mom, Bertha. “They were to study, and they knew to volunteer their time to charitable causes.” (Rothblatt’s father is deceased; her sister politely declined to comment for this story.) The family was observantly Jewish — Marty played the theme from “Exodus” at the bar mitzvah — and lived on modest means.  Marty enrolled in UCLA but quit after a year to travel on the cheap with buddies. Van rides across Europe, selling the van in Turkey, teaching English in Iran, touring eastern Africa ... wound up living in a ratty house in the Seychelles Islands, which was supposed to be cool. It wasn’t.  While there, a buddy took Rothblatt to a U.S. satellite installation. There — right there — is where she says her mind took an exponential leap forward, imagining how close future worlds really were.  Marty went back to UCLA with a wild new energy and a family in tow. The marriage to a Kenyan woman soon collapsed, but Marty raised their son Eli on his own. Father and son lived in dire, if self-imposed, poverty while dad spent seven years going through undergrad, law and the MBA programs.  “Martine wanted to do things on her own,” her mom remembers.  “Literally the starving student,” remembers Paul Rosenthal, then chairman of the communications school. “I remember her wearing one checked shirt and pair of jeans every day. It may have been all she had.” Charlie Firestone remembers Marty clearly — “the most brilliant student I had in 13 years of teaching at UCLA law school. ... Just a fascinating mind.”   It was 1979 when Marty met Bina, a real estate agent, at a mixer in Hollywood. The two shared an instant attraction and mutual life circumstances: Bina was a single parent, too, of a young daughter named Sunee.  They soon married, moved to D.C., cross-adopted Eli and Sunee and eventually had Gabriel and Jenesis.  By the mid-1980s, Rothblatt was getting a reputation among the space law cognoscenti for brilliance and knowledge of FCC regulations and of the intricacies of broadcasting wavelengths.  “A conceptual genius,” says Tobey Marzouk, partner at Marzouk & Parry, who was legal partners with Rothblatt in the 1980s. “Her ideas were quantum leaps of the technology at the time.” Rothblatt was hired as a lobbyist for a fledgling concern called Geostar, initially a satellite tracking service for trucking companies.  Rothblatt worked insane hours — going to the office about 2 a.m. for a day’s research and planning before the doors opened seven hours later — but the family was tightknit. Bina had converted to Judaism and often worked as his de facto office manager. Bina’s mom, who had moved in with them, watched the kids. On Friday evenings, they would have “love night” at home. It began with a family song:   Love night, love night, love is all around   love night, love night, here love can be found   family is our source of our strength   forever we are one and the same    love night, love night, love is all around   “That was at the dinner table,” says Gabriel Rothblatt, 32, now a father of four and living in Melbourne Beach. “We’d all have dinner or go out to dinner, sitting around the table, bless the bread and light the candles. We’d go from oldest to youngest and everyone say what love meant to them this week. It was an opportunity for everybody to speak while everyone else is quiet, but it was also a session to reflect on the meaning of love during the previous week and how it affected you.”  By the early 1990s, Rothblatt had founded CD Satellite Radio, a forerunner of satellite worldwide radio, then changed the name to Sirius, for the brightest star in the sky. Rothblatt came out first to Bina, announcing an affinity for wearing dresses, and Bina said it was no big deal. The kids were not exactly thrilled — some friends stopped coming over, some people stared at Martin in a dress — but they told the kids not to worry. Martine was always going to be their dad, Bina was always going to be their mom, and stupid people were always going to be stupid. The gender switch led to Martine’s first manifesto-type book, “The Apartheid of Sex.” It argued that people come in vast ranges of sexualities and that two genders simply could not describe the reality.  The book got a $100,000 publishing contract. Sirius went to its IPO. Rothblatt earned millions.  She was 40 years old.     James Zhan, left, and specialist Sam Popa work on a lung being kept alive and restored in an incubator at United Therapeutics, which is pioneering new methods for lung transplant. (André Chung/For The Washington Post)    Psshhhttt, hsshhhttt. Pssshhttt, hssshhtttt. Most likely, you’ve never been in a room with a disembodied set of lungs, watching it breathe via a ventilator. It’s kind of creepy, the sides coming together, all wet and fleshy and fluffing back out again. ... We are in a high-tech lab of Lung Biotechnology, a subsidiary of U.T. We are checking in on Rothblatt’s clinical trial to reclaim marginal lungs not accepted for transplant.  The facility is just across from the company’s Spring Street headquarters. In a sealed room that looks like a surgical suite — tubes and air lines and flat screens displaying real-time medical data, everybody wearing paper overalls and masks and booties — are said lungs, in a circular glass incubator.  Yesterday, they were breathing in the chest of a 56-year-old man, a 30-year smoker and drug user. Last night, he died of a stroke.  This morning, they’re here. They’re big — huge, actually, because the lungs tend to expand when not compressed by the rib cage — and the clear plastic dome fogs with condensation.  The staff, led by Thomas Hartnett , has been running fluids and medication through the lungs to maintain and assess them while removing excess fluids. A broncoscope with a tiny camera runs through the main passageways, offering views of the interior. The data they’re picking up goes to the cloud, so any doctor on the system with Internet access — even a smartphone on a golf course — can determine if it might work for transplant.  Should the process be approved in the United States, it would significantly reshape the high-pressure ecosystem of lung transplants. About 8,000 lungs are donated each year. But on average over a decade, only 1,600 find continued life in someone else. There are six to eight hours to make the switch — a huge network of jets, helicopters, ambulances and surgeons are on call — yet more than two-thirds are not, in the final analysis, approved for transplant. Rothblatt’s project is to preserve those marginal donations — out of body for up to 24 hours — so that they might be maintained while a suitable recipient is found. The process is legal in Canada, and Rothblatt’s company is among a few trying to win FDA approval. It has worked on more than 40 lungs since May, practicing and documenting results. Once the process is approved, the company will start putting the lungs in patients on a trial basis.  “The idea is to get 40 or 50 donated lungs per week,” Hartnett says. “About 2,000 a year. That would double the number of transplants.” And, as he points out, that’s no small thing: Transplants are for end-stage lung disease. People who do not get them in time — and there’s a long waiting list — do not live. There are many diseases that can result in the need for a full or partial lung transplant. One of them is pulmonary arterial hypertension. Because it has no known cure, a lung transplant may someday be required for the very soul of the company.     Bina and Martine Rothblatt with daughter Jenesis, whose illness inspired the founding of United Therapeutics. (Photo courtesy of Jenesis Rothblatt/for The Washington Post)   Jenesis Rothblatt comes walking down a Bethesda sidewalk on a mid-autumn evening to meet for dinner. The impression is not of a lung patient. She’s tall, vibrant, angular, strikingly attractive, high cheek bones, bright smile.  “I haven’t fainted in 10, maybe 12 years,” she says, sitting down, ordering a glass of red.  She started getting short of breath at about 5, on family skiing trips. Later, the spells would come at random. “I’d start to hear something like the tinkling of fairy dust, if that makes any sense. Then I’d see little dark spots, going from the outside in, until it was one big black spot.” She’d faint, dropping as if shot. Bina, on the terror of the time: “I was doing her hair one time, just combing it out, and she just collapsed. Right through my hands, I couldn’t catch her. She was out.” The medication at the time was not particularly effective. There were I.V. pumps, her parents waking her in the night to give her medication. Rothblatt left Sirius, desperately trying to find better treatment. But the disease had about 3,000 patients in the United States — it was so rare and treatment so expensive that major pharmaceutical companies weren’t interested. Rothblatt pestered experts, set up a foundation and sent out requests for proposals. Then she and Bina took Jenesis traveling. “She was about 10 or 11, she was on oxygen, and we thought her life was about over,” Rothblatt said. “We thought, ‘Let’s just show her what we can of the world.’ ” They toured, seeing the Great Wall of China, and when they came back, Rothblatt was stunned to find several doctors had answered her requests.  She was impressed with James Crow, a just-retired research scientist who had done work on the condition, and got him to come on board. They eventually developed a key drug, Remodulin, that helped keep blood pathways open in the lungs, though it is delivered by injection or a pump. They developed Tyvaso, which is inhaled; and finally, Orenitram, a pill.  The medications can cost north of $100,000 per year, but as treatments improved, so did the number of patients able to benefit from them. Today, more than 30,000 patients are treated with these or similar drugs each year. “All of these are people just would not be alive without these medicines,” Rothblatt said at a recent conference.  Jenesis’s condition slowly improved. But she tired of the illness and the sheltered lifestyle it imposed. “I still wanted to be able to go out and do the things other kids my age were: sleepovers, roller coasters, staying up past 7 p.m.” So she rebelled. “I drank, I skipped class, I wouldn’t take my medication.” But then, as the pages on the calendar turned, she matured, studied audio engineering, then biochemistry. U.T. didn’t provide the only medication she took, but it was at the forefront of the field.  Today, she takes three pills per day (one made by U.T.) and feels lazy if she takes an elevator up a floor rather than hoofing it. She just moved to L.A., still working for the company, but a little glad to get out of the home office. “Because it was founded in my honor, there’s really no way I could be disassociated from it, whether I worked there or not,” she says. “On one hand, it’s very humbling. It’s so special. It’s kind of cool. But, sometimes, you’d like to be a little more anonymous.”     Martine and Bina Rothblatt at U.T. headquarters. A couple so close their children call them “Marbina.” (André Chung/For The Washington Post)   One of the first things you notice about Rothblatt is that she has a very offhand manner. Second, she’s almost comically upbeat. She effusively praises subordinates in meetings, compliments the waiter at lunch on the tea and praises Bina in all things — even if it’s her habit of rearranging furniture, unbidden, even if it’s the sitting room of a doctor’s office. “She’s got a natural sense of feng shui!”  Rothblatt is 6-foot-2, rangy, an athletic lope to her stride. She sometimes wears custom-made women’s suits (“women’s clothes don’t really fit me, men’s clothes don’t really fit me”), but mostly she knocks around in dark slacks and a pullover. On this particular recent evening, she has her hair flat-ironed, is wearing dark slacks, a turtleneck and a leather jacket. If she told you she was a yoga instructor, you’d totally go for it.  She, Bina and I were chatting in a sitting area on the sixth floor of U.T. headquarters. The cubed tables change colors every few seconds. It was after closing hours, and when a stray employee walked past, Rothblatt halts the conversation to call out, “Thanks for working late!” It grew late. As we were leaving, she pointed out the window, across the street. The lights were still on at the lab. “They’re sending our first lung to be transplanted tonight in Toronto,” she said. “See the ambulance?” The transplant was completed at 1 a.m. Eight hours later, she e-mailed me pictures, replete with time stamps. “Last night one fewer person died on the transplant list,” she wrote, exultant. “I feel confident that we’ll at minimum double # of transplants by end of 20teens.”  Roll your eyes? Sure, go ahead. Then go back up, near the beginning of this story, and, when betting against the future, reread the handicapping of Ray Kurzweil, generally regarded as one of the planet’s great minds, about the track record of Martine Rothblatt.

Soon they were living in the suburbs of Washington, in an apartment that was way too small. It was a hectic, happy time. The Rothblatts, now married, legally adopted each other’s children, and would soon have two more. Bina started her conversion to Judaism (her given name is actually Beverlee). In 1983, convinced that no one had quite yet realized the commercial possibilities of outer space, Martin left the big law firm that paid for his move cross-country and went out on his own, first launching Geostar, the pathbreaking car-navigation system, and then Sirius, the culmination, in a way, of his Seychelles vision. Martin imagined a world in which tiny satellite dishes might be attached to cars, allowing a driver to cover vast distances and never lose a radio signal. The traditional broadcasters saw Sirius as unwanted competition, but funded with millions from previous successes, Martin got improbable approval from the FCC. �She’s an outstanding conceptual salesperson,� says her friend and fellow futurist Ray Kurzweil. Martine has described her Sirius entrepreneurship more bluntly: �I was a tough-talking satellite engineer.� 
Bina was as surprised as anyone when her husband told her, in the early ’90s, of his desire to become a woman, and Martine has said she delayed broaching the subject until she was certain Bina would not leave. �I love you for your soul, not your skin� is how Bina responded. �I was so lucky,� Martine reflects now. �So, so lucky.� 
And so began the years of transition. There were hormones, of course, and endless hours of psychotherapy aimed at establishing that Martine’s urge was neither fleeting nor shallow. She began dressing as a woman in ever-widening circles�first out with Bina alone, then with friends, and finally on weekends with the kids and their friends. The children (I spoke to three out of four) agree it was an anguishing time. They were teased at school (�Who wears the pants in your family now?� ); neighbors moved away. 
In the conventional narrative about sex reassignment, a person is so sure from such a young age that he or she inhabits the wrong body that a surgically corrected self is a lifelong dream. Martine says the idea was in her mind from the time she was about 15 years old. �I idealized myself in my mind as female,� she says, even using the word �gay,� �in the sense of seeing myself as a woman, sexually attracted to women.� But this female self-image didn’t drive or define her, and it didn’t exclude other visions of herself. (�I loved my penis,� she told Howard Stern in a 2007 interview.) Her female identity was also invisible to those around her, and not just to Bina. �There is absolutely nothing that would indicate that this was his tendency or preference, absolutely nothing,� Rosa Lee told me. �She isn’t a woman, and neither am I,� added Martine’s friend Kate Bornstein, one of the founders of the transgender movement, who saw a special courage in Martine’s disinclination to fully embrace either gender at a time, during the mid-’90s, when �gender queer� had not yet become a familiar term.
Gabriel Rothblatt, the third of Martine and Bina’s children, remembers the day, when he was 11 years old, that Martine told him about her imminent surgery; they were at the mall. Now 31, Gabriel is a father of four and running for Congress as a Democrat in Florida’s Eighth District, with a platform whose first item is �Space.� 
�Will you still be my dad?� Gabriel asked. 
�I’ll still be your dad,� Martine answered. �I’m not changing. I’m only changing physically. I’m going to be like a butterfly.�
As adults, the siblings have hashed over Martine’s choice, Gabriel says. If genitalia aren’t defining, then why put yourself and the people you love through such a painful process? Gabriel says he long ago made peace with Martine’s decision: �She did what she felt was right, the right choice for her.� But he also sees that it may have sprung as much from her lifelong determination to cross all borders as from a compulsion that was bred in the bone. �Sometimes it’s necessary to be a living example,� Gabriel told me. �If the point was just rhetorical, if this was just some philosophical scrabbling, the message wouldn’t have been as strong.� Then he brings up what he calls the familiar joke about why the libertarian chicken crossed the road. �The libertarian chicken dreams of the day when no one asks them why they crossed the road. It’s your body. It’s your choice what you choose to do with it. It’s not even our place or our business to be judging them or asking them why.� 



Next: �Identify the corridors of indifference and run like hell down them.�

Thank you. Dr. Rothblatt, you may begin your conference.
Martine Rothblatt
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. I'm joined today by James Edgemond, our Chief Financial Officer. I will offer some brief introductory remarks and then turn over the call to questions that can be directed to James or myself.
This morning I would like to hit on four main topics: profits, products, pipeline and payers. First with regard to profits, we are once again in the 90%-plus range gross margin on our revenues, and in the past quarter those revenues hit $408 million. That keeps us well above the $1.5 billion per year revenue run rate that was our goal for 2016 and it keeps us right on track for our goal of $2 billion per year by the end of the decade. Profit comparisons with last year are a bit complicated by last year's extraordinary gain on the sale of our FDA voucher, but non-GAAP per diluted share profits are up 25% this year from the matching quarter last year.
I do expect substantial increases in R&D spending going forward as we have now grown our pipeline from one to six Phase III or registration design studies and have accelerated our drug device combination work in many ways. Nevertheless, even with this heightened R&D spending, I am confident we will remain strong profitability – we will maintain strong profitability.
Let me now turn to the second topic, products. Our treprostinil products – Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram – faired differentially from the matching quarter last year with Orenitram growing 18%, Tyvaso dropping 16%, and Remodulin inching up a percent. These results reflect the ability of patients to remain on one or another of the ever-increasing number of oral therapies longer than in the past, hence the normal 25% annual patient attrition that we have long experienced with Tyvaso due to disease progression is no longer fully compensated for in real time with new starts from patients failing oral therapies. Instead, patients failures on [indiscernible] for example, of about 15% a year per their label, they first go to Uptravi and then to Orenitram or vice versa before ending up on Tyvaso or Remodulin.

However, the more patients who are on oral drugs for a longer period of time ultimately just means that there will be even more patients on Tyvaso and Remodulin. The dip in Tyvaso revenues is also transient because we have two Phase III trials underway that will result in a substantial growth well beyond its current level of sales and beyond what will arise from the backlog of patients now cycling through oral therapy.
The first Phase III trial involving Tyvaso is BEAT, which is now over 80% enrolled and is designed to double the average time patients are on Tyvaso by combining it with Tysuberprost, which is the most adverse prostacyclin receptor-activating agent based on the in vitro studies.
The second Phase III trial is INCREASE, which is designed for the blue water market of WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension, which has some 35,000 patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.
So by keeping patients on Tyvaso much longer even after they fail oral therapies and by bringing tens of thousands of new patients to Tyvaso, we expect its peak revenues to rebound to well above current levels.
On top of the resources of Tyvaso growth, the growing backlog of Tyvaso patients who are now being managed on the oral drugs will almost all eventually end up on Tyvaso and/or Remodulin. So there is a big increase in Tyvaso patients coming.
Let me also mention that the IP situation on Tyvaso is very strong. We have patent protection out to the late 2020s – in fact 2028 in particular. While companies may try to attack these patents, I think they will have little chance of defeating multiple patents as well as a drug approval that is tied to a particular and quite unique device of which we are the only manufacturer.
Now let me turn to Orenitram. We also expect continued growth in Orenitram as patients fail ETRA and PDE-5 therapies, even before trying Uptravi or after failing Uptravi.
In addition, we expect this growth to be further accelerated with each of the four upcoming events. One, results of the FREEDOM-EV trial demonstrated morbidity, mortality benefits of Orenitram.
Two, results of the new [indiscernible] study demonstrating the benefit of Orenitram above and beyond tadalafil and ambrisentan. Three, results of the SOUTHPAW study demonstrating the benefits of Orenitram for Group 2 pulmonary hypertension patients.
And four, results of the IRONS study demonstrating the benefits for Orenitram for Group 5 pulmonary hypertension patients. These four Orenitram acceleration events will occur at the rate of one about every 12 to 24 months for the next five years of growth.
And as a further bonus, Orenitram is protected by nine Orange Book patents going out to 2031. Here is an interesting little factoid. The average number of patents that protect an approved drug is about three with the median being even lower, about two.
So Orenitram is about 3 times to 4 times the number of Orange Book patents protecting it as the average in our industry. But it only takes one patent to protect you. And I think of these nine Orange Book patents on Orenitram as the nine lives of Orenitram, and we are still on just our first life. Meanwhile, our non-prostacyclin product, Adcirca, continues to grow smartly, based on the results of the AMBITION morbidity/mortality study that showed ambrisentan when combined with our drug Adcirca produces the same kind of reduction of morbidity as does Uptravi, but at a much lower price.
We would expect more and more payers to require ambrisentan and Adcirca therapy before permitting patients to be reimbursed on more expensive therapies. This also has a temporary effect, by the way, of diminishing the flow of patients on to Tyvaso or Remodulin, as mentioned earlier. But as we have seen this quarter, the total volume of PAH patients ultimately needing Tyvaso and Remodulin remains the same.

They are just right-shifted in time as a swelling backflow of patients ultimately progress through their oral medications and the vast majority of these patients do, we expect them to – see them treated with Tyvaso and Remodulin as there are no alternatives with anything near the market share of Tyvaso and Remodulin. Indeed, with our planned Tysuberprost product in Phase III and our RemoSynch product queued for 2017 approval, the Tyvaso and Remodulin alternatives and follow-ons to oral therapies will be better than ever.
We've spoken quite a bit about our products. Now let me turn to our pipeline. We now have six products in our Phase III or registration study pipeline, plus several more in Phase II or earlier stages. The Phase III products not discussed earlier in my intro include OreniLeft for WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension, specifically [indiscernible] OreniCell for WHO Group 5 pulmonary hypertension, specifically pulmonary hypertension associated with sickle cell disease.
If our SOUTHPAW and IRONS studies for Group 2 and Group 5 pulmonary hypertension, respectfully, are successful, these would be the first two drugs ever approved for those indications. Next quarter, we will also commence enrollment of our SAPPHIRE study of eNOS gene therapy for Group 1 pulmonary hypertension, and we will commence enrollment of our accelerated approval study of dinutuximab for small cell lung cancer.
Following on the small cell lung cancer development in our pipeline will be registration studies of dinutuximab for several other poorly treated GD2-expressing cancers such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas.
Our pipeline also includes several novel drug device combination products such as the RemoSynch implantable pump systems, which now has a PDUFA countdown to April 10 of next year and the RemUnity disposable pump system, which is on schedule for 2018 approval.
We have also continued to rapidly progress our pain-free transdermal Remodulin prodrug system called RemoPro and remain on schedule to launch that product by the end of 2019.
Let me wrap-up the introduction with a word or two about payers. While we have long given our drugs for free to anyone who could not pay for them, the number of patients receiving our drugs for free does not exceed 5% of the total patient count.
We believe the reason for this is that we have excellent relations with payers and we expect this to carry over to the launch of generics in the coming years. For example, payers appreciate the fact that we have imposed no Remodulin price increases upon them at all for over five years, as compared to the generic companies that we have recently read about in the news who jack up their prices after offering initial discounts.
Payers have been well educated by physicians that there are numerous medically important reasons to reimburse Remodulin as prescribed for the fragile Class III and Class IV New York Heart Association patients for whom it is their last resort before lung transplant.
Hence, we remain confident that Remodulin, Tyvaso sales will continue to grow even if generic products are launched. Operator, you may please open the phone for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.
Evan Seigerman
Hi all, this is Evan Seigerman on for Geoff. Thanks for taking my question. My question focuses on the RemoSynch with the PDUFA in April. Is this PDUFA date specifically for your drug component of the device or is it the drug device component, and what have you been doing to prepare for the launch of this to make sure that patients are able to get it as soon as launched? Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Yes Evan, great question. So first of all that April 10 PDUFA date would be for that Medtronic catheter, which is necessary for the RemoSynch system to work and there are two possibilities in terms of what would be the approval date for the drug device combination, which would be our NDA would be a drug device combination and the FDA did specifically want it to be an NDA.

So the first possibility is, during the six-month review period of the Medtronic catheter, the FDA will ask us to allow us to complete the information that they requested in the complete response letter so that at the same day that they approve the Medtronic catheter, that at the same time we could get the approval of the NDA for the RemoSynch drug device combination.
And that would be the result of discussions between the FDA staff and our company. I have no insight into whether that pathway would be successful or not. It clearly has the advantage of simplicity reducing some drag on the FDA's time and simplicity for people and the patients being able to get the implantable pump sooner than otherwise.
However, if that pathway does not occur, then what ends up happening is we after the Medtronic PMA is approved on their catheter, then we have 60 days period for the FDA to review our resubmitted NDA with the benefit based on the approved PMA for Medtronic, and that doesn't require a whole six months PDUFA date.
That is a type of response. I'm sorry. I always get them mixed up whether it is type 1 or type 2, but it is one of those two type 1/type 2 things that suggest a 60-day turnaround. And so like the outset of planning dates for our launch of the RemoSynch system is June 10. And it is – I would say – maybe I will push that till the end of June because, if the Medtronic PMA is approved on April 10, then we would be a week or two to just wrap all that information into our resubmission of the NDA of the complete response information.
So maybe it would be 60 days from the end of April. But, in any event, it is looking stronger than ever and better than ever now for being able to launch the RemoSynch system in the first half of 2017.
Now, what we have done is we've – we've done a lot of interesting restructuring of our sales and marketing forces. You may recall previously we had two differently branded sales teams, a, one biotechnology sales team and United Therapeutics branded sales team.
Now we just have one single United Therapeutics branded sales team that provide physicians with a complete continuum of care package starting with Adcirca, Orenitram and then Tyvaso and Remodulin.
So by creating this much more streamlined comprehensive sales force we were also able to develop a kind of early entry sales team to prepare the market for our next products which are right around the corner.
As you heard in my opening remarks, we've got quite a number of products in our pipeline and we expect every 12 to 24 months there to be additional launches either of new labels or new products that will affect us.
So this team – this new team is specifically focused on preparing for rapid launches of all new products and they consist of some of the best and most experienced people we have. So there will be a very rapid launch on RemoSynch.
Now, I myself was, frankly, a little bit pleasantly surprised in speaking with physicians. I thought like if a patient – I thought it would be mostly like new patients going on RemoSynch and the ones that were already on the ex-vivo pump system that we have today would kind of stay with what they are because the patients are very fragile. I always hear so much that nobody wants to change the therapy. And anyway, you don't want to touch and mess around with what's not broken.
However, the way the physicians that I have all spoken with look at it is different for RemoSynch. They feel that, first of all, it's the exact same drug Remodulin and the safety record on RemoSynch is extraordinary. We beat our p-value on safety by more than the order of magnitude.
So the benefits to the patients are huge in terms of their quality of life and stuff like that. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, unfortunately pulmonary hypertension right now is an insidiously progressive disease. We're doing everything we can to come up with new cures like our gene therapy and whatnot. But right now, it is progressive.

And so when you are on your last line of therapy, you want that experience to be as good as possible, and the implantable experience is far and above superior to having a pump and a catheter dangling outside of your body. So their attitude is actually to call patients in and offer to transition them from the ex-vivo system to the implantable system.
And, in addition, the newly – the patients who are newly failing the oral therapies would – I thought that they would actually – first, that they would just go right to the RemoSynch, but actually they will start on Remodulin ex-vivo for a short period of time just to make sure that that patient has no intolerance to Remodulin as a drug and then after a period of maybe anywhere from a week to two months they would be moved onto the implantable system.
So the ex-vivo Remodulin system has a very important role to play as a bridge to the RemoSynch system, I think, for many years into the future. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Liana Moussatos of Wedbush. Your line is open.
Liana Moussatos
Thank you for taking my question. When we start seeing data from the new pipeline for dinutuximab and for the Groups 2, 3 and 5 pulmonary hypertension, data releases start in 2018 or 2019?
Martine Rothblatt
Yes, let me pull out my pipeline chart here to give you the answer to that, Liana. So I believe that the data on dinutuximab would start being visible in 2018 and we would likely begin having some sub-study and adapt the sub-group data available on SOUTHPAW on 2019. So I think you are correct.
Liana Moussatos
Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jessica Fye of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jessica Fye
Hey there, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess with lot of patients on oral prostacyclins for a longer period of time as you sort of indicated in your prepared remarks, is it possible that once they progress those patients could end up skipping Tyvaso and go straight on to Remodulin i.e., is that possible that that group you're describing as the Tyvaso backlog could be more of a Remodulin or RemoSynch kind of backlog and how should we think about the timeframe within which this backlog will start kind of flowing back through the numbers? Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Yes, very great question. So it's a diverse population, and every patient's got a diverse history with the disease. I think there will be patients that will skip over on – over Tyvaso and I think there will be other patients that will be – do everything they can to basically resist going on, quote-unquote, the [indiscernible], whether it's implacable or otherwise.
The backlog is large enough that it's going to forecast significant growth for both Tyvaso and for Remodulin. Historically, about half of the patients have gone from oral directly to Remodulin and about half of the patients have gone from oral to Tyvaso.
So now that you've got this baloney number of patients who are cycling through the oral, I think you're going to see the same experience of half of them going to one and half of them going to the other. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Scotti of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Regina Grebla
Hi, good morning. This is Regina Grebla for John. So I had a question here, your 10-Q now lists Phase III for treprostinil in liver transplant patients. Can you give us a little bit more color on this program and we know you're working on organ manufacturing, so should we assume that your Phase III now ties into your organ program? Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Yeah, very good question. We do have an additional Phase III development of treprostinil in liver transplant, and that's followed from Phase II study that we completed about year and half ago or so. That was a single standard study up at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. And the results were very encouraging with the role of prostacyclin being one that seems to mitigate against the reperfusion injury which is – which is frequently a cause of a worse outcome in liver transplant.

So our decision to move forward on R&D spending on that into the Phase III is indeed, as you said, justified by our growing footprint in transplant. I didn't mention it as one of the fixed Phase III trials upfront because we kind of break our work down to material and nonmaterial programs and because the patients who would use Remodulin in a transplant setting will use it transiently, maybe like a week of drugs, something like that, it's not going to end up being a material contributor to revenues as an indication per se. But what it does do is it further expands the United Therapeutics' footprint in the transplant groups at each of the major medical centers who are also very much the same groups that we work with for our ex-vivo lung perfusion products where we are able to take lungs and through our strategic investment in TransMedics kidneys and hearts as well and provide marginal organs that are not immediately transplantable with a period of ex-vivo perfusion.
And then the data has shown and been peer-reviewed published that with just four hours of ex-vivo perfusion, about half the time organs that are not good enough for transplant are good enough for transplant. And the one year of survival data on those patients has been indistinguishable from organs that do not go through ex-vivo perfusion. So, yes, it is all part of this strategic placement of resources of United Therapeutics into the transplantation stage, which we would hope to be a material revenue contributor in the 2020s. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Chris Shibutani
Thank you. Three quick questions, if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about R&D expenses. Obviously, we have kind of pushes and pulls with the FREEDOM-EV study continuing but expected to wrap up, but then many of the pipeline efforts. Can you give us some sense for the scale in the step-up that you are describing?
Second question would be on the pump itself, recognizing that Medtronic's pump business is currently under consent decree. Can you confirm that this consent decree would need to be released in order for the implantable pump to become commercially available or not? Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Okay. So let's see if I got it all. Let me go in reverse order. So, first of all, the consent decree does not need to be released in order for the implantable pump to be approved and for our RemoSynch product. So unambiguous does not. Pretty much one thing has nothing to do with the other. And it simply relates to procedures within Medtronic for releasing of pumps to patients, but does not affect the regulatory approval process at all. I think the next question was, if I could give you some kind of gauge of the increase in R&D spending based on the...
Chris Shibutani
Magnitude and trajectory, yeah, the R&D based upon everything you described at Science Day and pushes and pulls with FREEDOM-EV ramping up.
Martine Rothblatt
Yes, I appreciate the question, but I'm going to kind of stick with my introductory remarks that R&D spending is going to increase. We have gone from one Phase III study to six Phase III studies. And we have gone kind of from one drug device development to multiple drug device combination developments being accelerated in different ways. But I am absolutely positive that the increase in R&D spending will not impact upon United Therapeutics being a very, very profitable company. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Samir Siddhanti
This is Samir on for Terence. Thanks very much for taking the question. Just one question from the 10-Q. Can you offer any additional details on why you think the launch of SteadyMed's Trevyent could prevent you from launching RemUnity or RemoSynch, or did we incorrectly interpret that language? Thanks so much.

Martine Rothblatt
Yeah. Well, I think you probably read it in the risk factors where pretty much every possibility in the world is listed. But there is a point of view – and I will just call it a point of view, it's not one that I subscribe to – that the SteadyMed product, if approved by the FDA, because of its orphan drug designation status, would impede our ability to offer the RemUnity product.
But so that's a point of view, so we have got to disclose it in the risk factors. I personally think it makes no sense that the two technologies are extremely different, I mean different like day and night. At the Science Day, you heard – I think you and I met each other there. You heard some of the scientific presentations on why we are very skeptical that the SteadyMed product will offer any relief from pain associated with the transdermal pain associated with the treprostinil molecule. There is one technology that SteadyMed uses for their device.
The RemUnity product uses an entirely different technology. The acoustic wave sensing technology is a fundamental breakthrough in continuous drug delivery technology by the genius Dean Kamen, who has been investing in this field since auto-eject in the 1980s and the MiniMed technology and then the Medtronic and now this next quantum leap with the acoustic wave sensing technology.
So I think that the therapeutic and clinical advantages of the two technologies and their side effect profile are so different – as different as night and day – that this is not at all what the Orphan Drug Act was intended to block. What the Orphan Drug Act was intended to block is basically a generic company coming in with a copy of something that an innovator worked very hard to get approved for an orphan population.
And that if it did not stop somebody else coming in with a different drug, even a slightly different drug, even a slightly different delivered version of the same drug for that same orphan indication. So the Orphan Drug Act is a ramp-up. It's not a blockade, and I think it would be very odd and highly unlikely for it to be used as a blockade in this case. We have time, operator, for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Participant
This is Edwin [ph] on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you please share some details of the FDA CIO? You received response on implantable Remodulin. Anything else do you need to address other than the pump approval? Maybe you'll respond the NDA after April 2017, is that right? And similarly, how about the development and timeline of DEKA, what's the differentiation from the implantable pumps from Medtronic? Thank you.
Martine Rothblatt
Thank you for your questions. So the answer to the first question is that there is nothing else that will be needed for full approval and commercial launch of the RemoSynch product. following on the April PDUFA of the PMA from Medtronic on the catheter and then the drug device combination NDA approval for United Therapeutics, which simply involves responding to the complete response letter, the main point of which was that first they had to approve the Medtronic catheter before they could approve our drug in combination with the catheter.
That would be a Type 2 response, which is just 60 days after April. So pretty much the outside date we are looking at is the end of June, and there is kind of a best case that we could get everything approved at the same time in middle of April. But that's it. No other approval is needed for RemoSynch.
With regard to the DEKA technology, we – I mentioned in my last call that we have accelerated the number of different elements of that. And without delving into sort of proprietary details, I will say that we are doing everything necessary to secure a launch of that product in 2018. And I think we have multiple parallel avenues to ensure that has the highest probability of occurring launching after 2018.

And then, just so people don't get confused, there has been a next-generation version of that DEKA pump with a next-generation version of the treprostinil molecule, which we call RemoPro. And this is a version of the treprostinil molecule that impedes the portions of the molecule that causes pain in the transdermal tissue.
And then those additional atoms that we wrap around parts of the molecule that blocks the pain activation, they are then rapidly metabolized in the serum. So once that molecule gets into the bloodstream, it looks just like plain old fashioned treprostinil. And we feel confident that we will be able to work that approval out on the basis of a pharmacokinetic bioequivalent just as we got approval for intravenous Remodulin and the bioequivalence through compared to the subcutaneous Remodulin.
And that program is on track for 2019 approval. So there is – drug device approvals that we are looking at every year 2017, 2018, 2019, each one welcoming more and more patients than from this large backlog of patients we expect to be failing the oral therapies.
Martine Rothblatt
All right, everybody. Well, thank you very much for participating in our conference call this morning. James and I will be – next healthcare conference will be at JPMorgan, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. Operator, you can wrap up the call.

Time to Wake Up to Cyberconscious Robots


Entrepreneur and medical ethicist Martine Rothblatt discusses the future of artificial consciousness.






 By Martine Rothblatt


Martine Rothblatt is a lawyer, entrepreneur, medical ethicist, and the author of Virtually Human: The Promise--and the Peril--of Digital Immortality.

In the book Virtually Human: The Promise--and the Peril--of Digital Immortality, Martine Rothblatt explores the scientific and ethical consequences of artificial consciousness. In the following edited excerpt, she outlines how biotech companies are producing empathetic robots to take the place of human assistants.
Biotechnology companies are well aware that over 90 percent of an average person's lifetime medical expenditures are spent during the very last portion of their life. Lives are priceless, and hence we deploy the best technology we can to mechanically keep people alive. Medical cyberconscious mind support is the next logical step in our efforts to keep end-stage patients alive. The potential profits from such technology (health insurance would pay for it just like any other form of medically necessary equipment) are an irresistible enticement for companies to allocate top people to the effort. Consequently, brain-mapping projects are among the largest joint government-industry biotech projects in both Europe and the United States.

Health-care needs for older people are also driving efforts to develop the empathetic branch of cyberconsciousness. There are not enough people to provide caring attention to the growing legion of senior citizens. As countries grow wealthy their people live longer, their birthrates decline below the replacement rate, and, consequently, their senior citizens compose an ever-larger percentage of the population. Today there are five younger people to care for each older person, whereas in four decades there will be just two workers to care for each older person. There is a huge health-care industry motivation to develop empathetic robots, because a minority of young people actually want to take care of older people.
The seniors won't want to be manhandled, nor will their offspring want to be guilt-ridden. Other than importing help from developing countries--which only postpones the issue briefly, as those countries have gestating dependency ratio problems of their own--there is no solution but for the empathetic, autonomous robot. Grandma and Grandpa need--and deserve--an attentive, caring, interesting person with whom to interact. The only such persons that can be summoned into existence to meet this demand are manufactured software persons with robotic bodies, i.e., empathetic, autonomous robots with a physicality that mimics a flesh-and-blood person. Companies are putting expression-filled faces on their robots, and filling their code with the art of conversation.
There is much debate over whether the expression-filled faces of digital health-care assistants should be humanlike. Dueling robot scientists from Japan have taken opposing positions on the "uncanny valley" hypothesis. The uncanny valley is a posited sociopsychological threshold: People like expression-filled robots until they look too human, and then they freak people out. Masahiro Mori believes that "when they get too close to lifelike without attaining it, what was endearing becomes repellent, fast." Whereas Hiroshi Ishiguro "is interested in pushing not just technological envelopes but philosophical ones as well. His androids are cognitive trial balloons, imperfect mirrors designed to reveal what is fundamentally human by creating ever more accurate approximations, observing how we react to them, and exploiting that response to fashion something even more convincing." My experience leads me to believe that the uncanny valley is a myth. I have not seen anyone repelled by the verisimilitude of BINA48 [the humanoid robot based on my wife, Bina Aspen, after hours of interviews].
The information-technology industry itself is working on cyber-consciousness. IBM is sponsoring the Blue Brain project of Henry Markram, which is using supercomputer resources to create functional digital simulacra of portions of animal and human brains. The mantra of IT is "user-friendly," and there is nothing friendlier than a person. A cyberconscious house that we could speak to ("Prepare something I'd like for dinner," "Turn on a movie I'd like") is a product people would be willing to pay a lot of money for. It's getting closer: The Nest Protect is a smoke and carbon-monoxide alarm that talks to you in a calm human voice to warn of smoke or carbon dioxide in a room before sounding a loud alarm. Users can't talk back yet, but they can wave their hand to silence the alarm if it's simply a matter of burning the roast. A personal digital assistant that is smart, self-aware, and servile will outcompete in the marketplace PDAs that are deaf, dumb, and demanding. In short, IT companies have immense financial incentives to make software as personable as possible. They are responding to these incentives by allocating floors of programmers to the cyberconsciousness task. That's one reason why, in December 2012 Google hired, wisely in my opinion, master inventor Ray Kurzweil, the author of How to Create a Mind, as its director of engineering. In 2012, the company bought Boston Dynamics, a major player in the robotics industry, and in Janaury 2014 Google acquired British artificial-intelligence company DeepMind for about $500 million.
Note how rapidly programmers have arrogated into their programs the human pronoun "I." Until cyberconsciousness began emerging, no one but humans and fictional characters could call themselves "I." Suddenly, bits and building blocks of vitology are saying, "How may I help you?," "I'm sorry you're having difficulty," "I'll transfer you to a human operator right away." The programmers will have succeeded in birthing cyberconsciousness when they figure out how to make the human operator totally unnecessary. From their progress to date, this seems to be the goal. Add to this Darwinian code, and conscious vitology has arrived.
A sixth and perhaps ultimate group devoting itself to creating conscious vitology is the "maker movement." A grassroots movement of people devoted to bridging the gap between software and physical objects arose in the early years of the twenty-first century. They call themselves "makers" and come together annually in different cities around the world at annual Maker Faires and related local gatherings. BINA48 attends the Vermont Maker Faire, where she is one of the most popular exhibitors, conversing with all who stroll by amid a veritable sea of homemade robots and 3D-printed objects of every sort.
Empowered by twenty-dollar computer boards called Arduinos that can be simply programmed to do almost anything (e.g., a plant can tweet via an Arduino in its soil when it needs water), the makers are passionate about building bridges between the virtual and real worlds. Dramatically dropping prices for 3D printers enable makers to envision printing bodies for minds, and a culture of open-source software lets the makers rapidly share and improve their mindware. There is nothing cooler to make than a person, and nothing happens faster than when countless thousands of people crowdsource solutions. It is perhaps unsurprising that The Economist has called the maker movement the harbinger of a "new industrial revolution" not unlike the "original industrial revolution grew out of piecework done at home, and look what became of the clunky computers of the 1970s."
Excerpted from Virtually Human: The Promise--and the Peril--of Digital Immortality by Martine Rothblatt (2014, St. Martin's Press.)

In May this year, Forbes released its list of the 50 Richest Self-Made Women. The 35th richest woman on the list, Martine Rothblatt, pulls in a net worth of $390 million dollars with her beginnings as founder of Sirius Satellite Radio in 1990 after graduating from UCLA with a joint MBA/PhD degree in 1981. When Jenesis, one of her four daughters, developed the rare disease pulmonary arterial hypertension, she left Sirius to become founder, Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics Corporation to help find treatments. Since then, she has remained with the biotech firm, which now sells four drugs and has approximately $1.3 billion in sales. Rothblatt was interviewed by TED's Chris Anderson earlier in March to talk about her work in technology and pharmaceuticals, as well as about her life. Martine Rothblatt's journey is one of success and hard work, and her success is well-deserved. Her impact is profound and tangible. But there is something else that makes her an even more incredible force in the corporate world.
Martine Rothblatt is transgender.
However, Rothblatt's gender identity is not her only defining characteristic. Now, over ten years after her sex-reassignment surgery in 1994, Rothblatt considers herself more of a transhumanist, which was described as "a particular kind of futurist who believes that technology can liberate humans from the limits of their biology—including infertility, disease, and decay, but also, incredibly, death" in a 2014 interview with New York Magazine, after she was named the top-earning American female CEO in 2014. Her passion for technology resulted in the robot Bina48, owned by Rothblatt's Terasem Movement, in 2010. The robot, named after Rothblatt's wife of over 30 years, Bina Rothblatt, is an artificial intelligence robot that has the memories, beliefs, and feelings of Bina herself uploaded to the robot's artificial intelligence database, and is even capable of holding some conversations.

Top AnswerI recommend paying cash for the cabs! They tend to add a surcharge if you're paying with credit card. Also, there's this amazing low-key place that sells amazing pan roast (lobster is my favorite!) called Oyster Bar. It's 24/7 but only allows a bar seating for up to 13 people at a time (so it's a pretty long wait). I think the best, money-saving trip to have is to grab a fat tuesday and walk down the strip at night! Catch the water show at the Bellagio, play some penny slots at Caesar's Palace, and grab a slice of "Secret Pizza" at the Cosmopolitan. Hope you two have fun! :)

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]




(L-R) United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt, OC Helicopters Pilot Ric Webb, Tier 1 Engineering President Glen Dromgoole, United Therapeutics Executive Vice President Paul Mahon before a flight test at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.


In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

Early life and education[edit]
Rothblatt was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1954 to Rosa Lee and Hal Rothblatt, a dentist.[3] Originally named Martin,[7] she was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.[8][9]
Rothblatt left college after two years and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey, Iran, Kenya, and the Seychelles. It was at the NASA tracking station in the Seychelles, during the summer of 1974, that she had her epiphany to unite the world via satellite communications. She then returned to University of California, Los Angeles, graduating summa cum laude in communication studies in 1977, with a thesis on international direct-broadcast satellites.
As an undergraduate, she became a convert to Gerard K. O'Neill's "High Frontier" plan for space colonization after analyzing his 1974 Physics Today cover story on the concept as a project for Professor Harland Epps' Topics in Modern Astronomy seminar. Rothblatt subsequently became an active member of the L5 Society and its Southern California affiliate, Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization and Settlement (OASIS).
During her four-year law-MBA program, also at UCLA, she published five articles on the law of satellite communications and prepared a business plan for the Hughes Space and Communications Group titled PanAmSat about how satellite spot beam technology could be used to provide communication service to multiple Latin American countries. She also became a regular contributor on legal aspects of space colonization to the OASIS newsletter.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Upon graduating from UCLA in 1981 with a joint MBA/JD degree, Rothblatt was hired by the Washington, D.C., law firm[10] of Covington & Burling to represent the television broadcasting industry before the Federal Communications Commission in the areas of direct broadcast satellites and spread spectrum communication. In 1982, she left to study astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but was soon retained by NASA to obtain FCC approval for the IEEE C band system on its tracking and data relay satellites and by the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies to safeguard before the FCC radio astronomy quiet bands used for deep space research. Later that year she was also retained as Vice President by Gerard K. O'Neill to handle business and regulatory matters for his newly invented satellite navigation technology, known as the Geostar System.[11]
Rothblatt is a regulatory attorney.[12] She also served as a member of the Space Studies Institute (SSI) Board of Trustees.[13]
In 1984, she was retained by Rene Anselmo, founder of Spanish International Network, to implement her PanAmSat MBA thesis as a new company that would compete with the global telecommunications satellite monopoly, Intelsat. In 1986, she discontinued her astronomy studies and consulting work to become the full-time CEO of Geostar Corporation, under William E. Simon as Chairman. She left Geostar in 1990 to create both WorldSpace and Sirius Satellite Radio. She left Sirius in 1992 and WorldSpace in 1997 to become the full-time Chairwoman and CEO of United Therapeutics.[14]
Rothblatt is responsible for launching several communications satellite companies, including the first private international spacecom project (PanAmSat, 1984), the first global satellite radio network (WorldSpace, 1990), and the first non-geostationary satellite-to-car broadcasting system (Sirius Satellite Radio, 1990).[15] Rothblatt helped pioneer airship internet services with her Sky Station project in 1997, together with Alexander Haig.[16] [17] She then successfully led the effort to get the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate frequencies for airship-based internet services.[18]
As an attorney-entrepreneur, Rothblatt was also responsible for leading the efforts to obtain worldwide approval, via new international treaties, of satellite orbit/spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services (1987) and for direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions (1992). She also led the International Bar Association's biopolitical project to develop a draft Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights for the United Nations (whose final version was adopted by the UNESCO on November 11, 1997, and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1998).[5] [19]
Rothblatt is a well-known voice for medical and pharmaceutical innovation. In 1994, motivated by her daughter being diagnosed with life-threatening pulmonary hypertension,[20] Rothblatt entered the world of the life sciences by first creating the PPH Cure Foundation and later by founding a medical biotechnology company (United Therapeutics, 1996).[14] At that time she also began studying for a Ph.D. in medical ethics at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London. The degree was granted in June 2001 based upon her dissertation on the conflict between private and public interests in xenotransplantation. This thesis, defended before England's leading bioethicist John Harris, was later published by Ashgate House under the title Your Life or Mine.[21] In 2013, Rothblatt was the highest-paid female CEO in America, earning $38 million.[22] Rothblatt received a total compensation of $31,581,896 in 2014. On May 11, 2010 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Ben Gurion University of the Negev in recognition of her accomplishments in satellite communications and biotechnology.[23] In April 2008, Rothblatt was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society.[24]
Aviation[edit]

In September 2016, the world's first electric-powered full-size helicopter took flight at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[25] This historic flight was conceived and mathematically demonstrated by Martine Rothblatt, President of Lung Biotechnology PBC, specified and implemented by Glen Dromgoole of Tier 1 Engineering and piloted by Ric Webb of OC Helicopters.[26] The helicopter, a modified Robinson R44 weighed 2500 pounds with its test pilot, flew for five minutes, attained 400 feet and exceeded 80 knots airspeed, all completely powered by rechargeable batteries. Design and development partners in the project include Rinehart Motion Systems and Brammo, Inc.. The project which was sponsored by Lung Biotechnology PBC is the first phase in the development and production of an Electrically-Powered Semi-Autonomous Rotorcraft for Organ Delivery (EPSAROD). Lung Biotechnology PBC intends to apply the EPSAROD technology to distributing manufactured organs for transplantation to major hospitals with much less noise and carbon footprint than current technology.[27]
On February 16, 2017, Rothblatt’s electric helicopter established new world records of a 30 minute duration flight and a 800 foot altitude at Los Alamitos Army Airfield.[28] At the end of the flight, the 2500 pound helicopter still had 8% state of charge remaining in its Brammo batteries. On March 4, 2017, Rothblatt and Ric Webb set a world speed record for electric helicopters of 100 knots at Los Alamitos Army Airfield under an FAA Experimental permit for tail number N3115T. This was also the first-ever flight of two people in a battery-powered helicopter.[29]
Rothblatt is an airplane and helicopter pilot with night-vision goggle (NVG) certification. She generally pilots a Pilatus PC-12NG and a Bell 429WLG. Her other achievements in aviation include providing current weather information to all XM radio-equipped North American aircraft via her SiriusXM satellite system, and pioneering Aircraft Geolocation Tracking via her Geostar Satellite System.[30]
Personal life[edit]
In 1982, Rothblatt married Bina Aspen, a realtor from Compton, California.[2][3][4][31][32] They have four children together. Rothblatt and Aspen legally adopted one another's children.[33][34]
In 1994, at age 40, she came out as transgender[35] and changed her name to Martine Aliana Rothblatt. She has since become a vocal advocate for transgender rights.
Social activism[edit]
In 2004, Rothblatt launched the Terasem Movement, a transhumanist school of thought focused on promoting joy, diversity, and the prospect of technological immortality via mind uploading and geoethical nanotechnology. Through a charitable foundation, leaders of this school convene publicly accessible symposia, publish explanatory analyses, conduct demonstration projects, issue grants, and encourage public awareness and adherence to Terasem values and goals. The movement maintains a "Terasem Island" on the Internet-based virtual world Second Life, which is currently composed of two sims,[36] which was constructed by the E-Spaces company.
Rothblatt is an advocate for LGBTQ rights and an outspoken opponent of North Carolina's controversial HB-2 law.[37]
Through her blog Mindfiles, Mindware and Mindclones, she writes about “the coming age of our own cyberconsciousness and techno-immortality“ and started a vlog together with Ulrike Reinhard on the same topic. She also created Lifenaut.com as a place where thousands of people could go to backup their minds.
Rothblatt contributed $258,000 to SpacePAC, a super PAC that supported her son, Gabriel, who was running as a Democrat in Florida's 8th congressional district[38] but lost.[39] Gabriel is a pastor for the Terasem Movement.[40][41][42][43]
Reception[edit]
In a January 4, 2008 blog post titled Marketing Transhumanism, lawyer and bioethicist Wesley J. Smith ridiculed the feasibility of the Terasem Movement Foundation's claims to offer a free service that can "preserve one's individual consciousness so that it remains viable for possible uploading with consciousness software into a cellular regenerated or bionanotechnological body by future medicine and technology". Smith facetiously questioned whether this offer would be followed by the sale of "longevity products".[44]
In an August 16, 2009 blog post titled The "Imagination" of a Robot Cultist, rhetorician and technocritic Dale Carrico harshly criticized Rothblatt's writings for promoting what he argues to be the pseudoscience of mind uploading and the techno-utopianism of the Californian Ideology.[45] In a February 28, 2010 blog post titled More Serious Futurology from Transhumanist Martine Rothblatt, Carrico criticized Rothblatt's claims about digital technology and "mindclones" as being nothing more than wishful thinking.[46] In a June 5, 2010 blog post titled Rothblatt's Artificial Imbecillence, Carrico criticized Rothblatt for caring more about rights of "virtual, uploaded persons"—who he argues are neither real nor possible—more than the rights of actual human persons and some nonhuman persons, such as great apes and dolphins.[47]
In a July 4, 2010 New York Times article titled Making Friends with a Robot Named Bina48, journalist Amy Harmon described as frustrating but occasionally thrilling her conversation with one of "humanity's first cybernetic companions," BINA48, created by Rothblatt and Hanson Robotics. She concluded it was "not that different from interviewing certain flesh and blood subjects."[48]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
