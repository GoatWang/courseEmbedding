You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

LLC FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Limited Liability Companies | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

The Registered Agent will be there for the life of your company, so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable. Agents and Corporations (IncNow) has been a Delaware Registered Agent since 1974, and at the same office since 1982. IncNow is family operated by Delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate law.Delaware Certificate of Formation RequirementsOur office will sign as the authorized person (also known as an organizer) and file a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State’s Division of Corporations to form the Delaware LLC on public record. Your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you. Other states refer to this document as Articles of Organization, but Delaware does not use that term.A Certificate of Formation must include:The name of the LLCThe name and address of the registered agentThe signature of an authorized individualOf special note, if the Delaware LLC is a Series LLC, which protects assets of parts of the LLC from the liabilities of other parts of the LLC, then this must be indicated on the Certificate of Formation (more information on the Series LLC may be found elsewhere on this site). Many optional provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Formation. Upon special request, we can include the names of members and/or managers on the Certificate of Formation.Delaware LLC Operating AgreementWith our complete package, we draft an Operating Agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures. Delaware requires that LLCs have an Operating Agreement that will govern it; however, Delaware does not require that the Operating Agreement be filed with the state, or even be in writing.It is recommended that you have a written, signed agreement. Even in a single-member Delaware LLC, the Operating Agreement is important because it provides a decision-making structure that will benefit the LLC when dealing with other entities, increase protection, and increase credibility for financial transactions. The Operating Agreement will include provisions such as liability, ownership, dissolution, and transfer of interest, among others.Many incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems. A well-crafted Delaware Operating Agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different direction.Signing the LLC Operating AgreementOnce the Delaware Operating Agreement has been drafted and approved, all members should execute it. Most Delaware LLCs, as a practical matter, will not draft and finalize the Operating Agreement until after formation. Many formal requirements of corporations, such as those related to voting and annual meetings, are not required by LLCs.  To this extent, many well-crafted Operating Agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operations.While an Operating Agreement can be enforceable unsigned, it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned Operating Agreement was agreed upon by all members. In multi-member LLCs, it is especially important to have a signed Operating Agreement. Should you change the agreement or ownership structure, an amended and restated LLC Operating Agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes.    Top 10 Reasons to Form an LLC in Delaware1. Delaware LLCs offer the most protection for you and your business with two-way protectionBy forming a Delaware LLC, you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities. This means that, if the business itself cannot pay a creditor, then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets, such as your house, car and other personal possessions.Delaware explicitly makes the “Charging Order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of LLC members. This prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company. Creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the LLC’s distributions to that member, not a control interest or a right to liquidate the LLC.2. Delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any stateDelaware governs the internal affairs of your company, including its liability shield. The corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the Delaware LLC Act, which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business, is thicker than any protection offered in any other state.3. Delaware LLCs can operate in almost any State or CountryYou can form a Delaware LLC no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the United States. Outside the United States, there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a Delaware LLC, and a Delaware LLC does not need to have a bank account or office in Delaware. A Registered Agent, such as IncNow, maintains a physical address in Delaware required to forward court and Delaware government notices to you.4. Delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businessWhen entering into a Delaware LLC, it is flexible in ownership and management structure. One individual can serve as both the owner and manager. An LLC is governed by its Operating Agreement, allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written. Since the LLC is a contractual entity, it is important that the Delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written. Furthermore, there is no required annual general meeting, and there is much less administrative paperwork in general, compared to a corporation.5. Managers are protected from lawsuitsThe LLC Agreement in Delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties. This allows business managers and controlling, managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors, provided such actions are not in bad faith. Even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced, business managers have the freedom to make business decisions, even if losses result without manager liability, provided the decisions are not self-dealing. Even self-dealing is not entirely prohibited; instead, self-dealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members.6. No Delaware income tax if your operations are in other states (and other business tax loopholes)There is no Delaware tax return to file for LLCs that are formed in Delaware, provided they conduct no business in Delaware.As with LLCs in other states, profits are taxed personally at the member level, but not at the LLC level. An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership, unless it elects S-Corporation or C-Corporation tax status.Having an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation can save thousands in self-employment taxes because your income can be split 50/50 between self-employment income and “S-Dividend” income. The S-Dividend can reduce your taxes by thousands. For example, splitting $200,000 of income would save the S-electing LLC member more than $4,000 in social security and Medicare taxes. Learn more about these advantages in our LLC tax tips section.7. Delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsThe Delaware Secretary of State’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour.8. You can use a Delaware LLC to own and manage almost anythingThe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multi-million dollar commercial properties. It may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets, like real estate or intellectual property.Most common uses include:To hold real property, such as personal or business real estateTo operate a service businessTo hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes, automobiles, boats and patents9. Delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks, not yearsDelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes, the Court of Chancery. Its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases, and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not. There are no jury trials in the Court of Chancery, so Court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the Court.The Delaware court system can act very quickly. Sometimes, the whole process, from start to finish (discovery and motions to trial decisions), can be over in two months. Written decisions from the Court of Chancery are the standard, and are often 100 pages long. This well-reasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes. Even appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court can be expedited. The Delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials.10. Delaware has the most pro-business laws of any US stateDelaware’s law is generally thought to be pro-business, and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses. Because of the maturity of Delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by Delaware’s judicial system, there is predictability in outcomes.This means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your LLC, there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome, which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate. Even when judges change, it is not a favoritism or political system. Judges in Delaware make reasoned, non-political decisions.

Eight out of ten entity filings at IncNow are for LLCs.When initially drafted, members have the power to craft their own LLC operating agreements. An LLC operating agreement is flexible for business needs and adaptable to any business application. The LLC also has fewer business formalities than any other business entity. The LLC is very easy to set up and operate. The LLC provides all the protection of a corporation and arguably more because it can keep creditors of members from becoming owners. The LLC also limits the right of creditors to a charging order remedy, and not a liquidation or sale of a business interest. A creditor can only become a passive lien holder, not an owner with voting rights.An LLC will be taxed as a partnership/sole proprietorship or the LLC can make a federal tax election to be taxed as an S-Corporation or C-Corporation with the IRS. This “3-way” tax flexibility is not available to a corporation and makes the LLC unique and desirable. That is called the “check the box” tax election.For simplicity, flexibility, protection and tax advantages, most people choose an LLC.

This is demonstrated by a US Chamber of Commerce study of state liability systems that has rated Delaware #1 in all eight studies it has conducted on all 50 states. A few examples of Delaware’s benefits include:Easy and ReliableDelaware law has been tested and provides predictability.Delaware regularly updates its laws to remain the leading state for incorporation.Delaware has a separate Court of Chancery that handles Corporation law cases quickly and competently.Lower CostsThe Delaware Corporation minimum annual franchise tax is $175 and the filing fee is $50.The Delaware LLC annual fee is $300, regardless of capitalization.Delaware does not tax intangible property such as leases or royalties (the “Delaware loophole”).ProtectionPiercing the corporate veil, or making individuals personally liable for claims against their business, is very unlikely in Delaware.Delaware explicitly makes the charging order the sole and exclusive remedy of creditors of LLC members, meaning that creditors of members can only receive distributions from the LLC, and not control foreclosure, or liquidation.

What is a Corporation, and what does Incorporating mean?A Corporation is a legal entity or legal “person” that exists completely separate from natural persons, and is typically composed of natural persons that hold stock in the corporation.Incorporating is the act of filing a new corporation.When incorporating, you have the ability to select the state of incorporation, which is the state where the initial paperwork is filed and the state that will govern the internal affairs of your business (relationship between decision makers and owners).Delaware General Corporation Law will protect your corporation only if you select to incorporate in the State of Delaware.Delaware has the most desirable legislature, statutes, case law and court system for corporate governance. Starting in Delaware is an easy choice that some business owners overlook in the haste to get started, but may regret later. Rarely is the state in which you reside as favorable as where the owners reside. After comparing all 50 states, business owners frequently decide to incorporate in Delaware.    Why Should I Incorporate in Delaware?Delaware has a reputation as the forerunner in corporate law in the United States. Industry leading companies, from credit cards (Discover, Bank of America) to technology (Google, Apple) to restaurants (McDonald’s, Chipotle) are incorporated in Delaware. So why should you join them and incorporate your business in Delaware?1. Delaware has the strongest Corporate Shield of any StateThe main reason to incorporate in Delaware is to protect personal assets from your business’s liability. This protection is referred to as the “corporate veil” or “shield”, and is especially strong in Delaware.2. Business-Friendly Government Services Many of the businesses that chose to organize in Delaware have done so because of the business-friendly government in Delaware. Delaware’s Court of Chancery is a specialized business court. With its established body of case law, the Delaware courts are experts at resolving business conflicts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has ranked Delaware’s litigation system the best in the country for fairness every year.3. Ability to Operate a Delaware Corporation in every State or almost any CountryWith a Delaware corporation, you have the ability to conduct business in every state and almost every country. Delaware corporations do not need a bank account or business address in Delaware, they need only a Registered Agent to forward Delaware annual notices and legal notices.4. Predictability in Ownership and Management StructureDelaware’s predictable laws on ownership and management allow you to structure your business with confidence. You can even have the protection of a corporation for a one-person business. For example, one individual can be sole Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the sole shareholder.5. Directors and Officers are protected from lawsuitsBusiness officers and Directors have the ability to take risks and make routine business decisions without fear of having those decisions second guessed by stockholders. Even if losses result, as long as the decisions were not self-dealing, the officers and directors should be protected from personal liability.6. No Delaware income tax returns  for Corporations operating outside of DelawareDelaware corporations do not have to file Delaware tax returns if they do not conduct business in Delaware.7. Tax AdvantagesA corporation is taxed as a C-Corporation unless it elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation. If the stockholders are eligible and timely elect to be taxed as an S-Corporation with the IRS, it can save the stockholders thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes by splitting income 50/50 between self-employment income and an “S-Dividend”.8. Delaware offers speedy document approval and filings The Secretary of State’s office in Delaware maintains extended hours for filing and can approve documents in as little as one hour for additional fees.9. A Delaware Corporation can be used to manage almost anythingCorporations can range from a one personal consulting company to a multi-million dollar technology business. Corporations are not recommended for holding passive assets, like real estate.10. Delaware has the fairest courts and laws of any stateThe United States Chamber of Commerce has recognized Delaware’s business dispute and incorporation climate by ranking Delaware’s litigation system #1 over the past 9 years. The advantage of having so many business disputes resolved in Delaware is that previous conflicts have established an extensive body of case law.    How to Start a Delaware Corporation1. Choose a NameChoose a unique corporate name that is not registered with the Delaware Secretary of State. The name must include a corporate ending or abbreviation thereof (ex. “Inc.”, “Incorporated”, “Company”, “Co..”, “Corporation”, “Corp.”, “Association”, etc.) You can always file a name amendment in the future. For example, when we incorporated “Pinterest,” the original name was “Cold Brew Labs.”2. Find a Registered AgentEvery Delaware corporation is required to have a registered agent in Delaware. The registered agent will forward lawsuits and correspondence from the Delaware Secretary of State to you.You do not need to visit or have an office or any other connection to Delaware to incorporate a corporation in Delaware. Select Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) to act as your registered agent.3. Draft a Certificate of IncorporationThe Certificate of Incorporation officially brings the corporation into existence in the public record. IncNow will prepare a Certificate of Incorporation that includes:Name of the corporationName and address of the Registered Agent of the corporationStatement of the type of business that the corporation will engage inNumber of shares of authorized stock that the corporation will issuePar value of each shareName and signature of the incorporatorIndemnification clause for breaches of Duty of CareAllowance for Director Amended BylawsThe standard form from the Secretary of State leaves off recommended provisions, such as the director amended bylaws and relaxed director liability. These provisions must be included in the Certificate of Incorporation and cannot be enforced if included only in the bylaws or elsewhere.4. Annual Taxes and FeesSimilar to most states, Delaware corporations pay a “franchise tax”, or annual fee. This fee is based either on the shares authorized by the corporation on its Certificate of Incorporation, or any Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that change the number of shares of stock the corporation is allowed to issue.We recommend incorporating with 1500 shares of voting stock to minimize both filing and annual fees. If additional shares of restricted or non-voting stock are desired or required in the future, the authorized number of shares can be amended.5. Stockholder AgreementIf your corporation has more than one stockholder, it should have a Stockholder Agreement.Stockholder agreements are optional, but recommended.They set out the powers and rights of stockholders, as well as their relationship with the corporation and must be executed by all stockholders.A stockholder agreement can place restrictions on transferring stock.Delaware law specifically allows certain restrictions on the rights of stockholders to sell their shares.In closely held corporations with very few stockholders, these agreements are especially important because they will govern the relationship between the stockholders.Notice of the stockholder agreement must also be on the stock certificates to provide notice to possible assignees of the restrictions.Any corporation with more than one stockholder should have a Stockholder Agreement to minimize future problems of valuation, buyback, and unwanted third parties owning stock as transfers or assignees.6. Stockholder Agreement ServiceTo the surprise of many business owners, bylaws do not include provisions for rights of first refusal or buy-out provisions for stockholders. Corporation stockholders should consider a Stockholder Agreement — an important additional service to protect their stockholders’ expectations.We offer a standard Delaware Stockholder Agreement for $199.A Delaware attorney developed this Stockholder Agreement in the course of practice.It has been modified for our customers to provide extra rights and protection for stockholders to prevent outsiders from becoming unwanted stockholders in their company in the event of a sale of stock or death of a shareholder.This document gives you a running start to future planning for your Corporation.    C-Corporations vs. S-CorporationsThe “C” vs. “S” discussion should not impact your pre-incorporation decision. While corporations are C-Corporations by default when they are incorporated, it is very easy to change classifications between C-Corporations and S-Corporations.There is no distinction between the Certificate of Incorporation for a C-Corporation and that for an S-Corporation. Every Corporation filed with any of the 50 US States starts out simply as a general Corporation.    ConclusionDelaware’s pro-business climate, makes it the location of choice for anyone seeking to incorporate their business. Whether large or small, your business can reap the benefits of incorporating in Delaware.

Important Information You Need to Know               Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > Delaware Series LLC Easy, Fast & ProfessionalDelaware Series LLCWhat is a Delaware Series LLC?The Delaware Series LLC is similar to a traditional LLC with divisions. Each series designated by the company may have assets associated with it that are not associated with other series therein. This provides for internal asset segregation. As a result, one series within the LLC may be insulated from the debts and liabilities of all other series of the LLC. It is no more expensive than a traditional LLC to maintain because it is filed as one entity and requires just one franchise tax payment in the state of Delaware. All of the series are created through a private operating agreement, not required to be listed with the Division of Corporations. Private record keeping is essential to maintain this asset segregation.How to Form a Delaware Series LLCTo form a Delaware Series LLC, it only requires (1) the $90 payment to the Delaware Division of Corporations and (2) filing of the standard one-page Certificate of Formation naming the registered agent with (3) an extra paragraph in the Certificate of Formation to notice others that the LLC has the right to create series.Regardless of how many protected business units (i.e., series) you would like to have as part of the LLC, no additional filing fees are required in Delaware. The names of the protected business units below the series LLC organization are only created by private operating agreement, not on the states’ records. Also, the names of the members of the Series LLC and the members of its protected business units are not filed with the Delaware Division of Corporations. Upon filing the Certificate of Formation, it is very important to sign a detailed Operating Agreement especially drafted to be used for the Series LLC.    Series LLC Definition & OriginSeries LLC DefinitionWhile different states will have different precise definitions of a series LLC, there is an overarching, general definition that they all share. It is a hybrid of 1) an LLC with internal divisions and 2) multiple LLC subsidiaries owned by a common parent LLC. It has features of each. Often it is set up to be a ‘mothership’ LLC that has the option of setting up as many ‘daughter’ series as the members see fit. While these materials will refer to the separate divisions of the series LLC as ‘series’ (both singular and plural), they are also often referred to as ‘cell(s)’.First the Series LLC is like a single LLC with divisions, because the enabling legislation for the series LLC does not say whether it is one or more entities under state law, therefore many consider it is only one ‘entity’ under state law. In the traditional LLC context a division of an LLC is a glorified ‘doing business as’ or d/b/a within an LLC. With divisions, each separate division is legally connected to the entity without any liability separation. Although the operations are conducted through different ‘departments’, each is just an extension of the traditional LLC. In a series LLC, each series is part of the LLC, not a separately filed LLC. The series LLC therefore does not need to register individual cells or ‘qualify’ the cells in foreign states after qualifying the Series LLC as a whole. Only the series LLC as a whole is on the official public record. However, this does not apply to Illinois, where each series must file a Certificate of Designation that sets forth the series name and its managers or members. This is also different in Missouri, where the Articles of Organization must contain information on every series and must be amended if a series is added or removed, and Montana, which requires inclusion of series operating agreements in the Articles of Organization. When the series LLC or cells therein do business or when it takes title to properties, the name is listed as ‘ABC Capital LLC, series 1’. It never loses the name of the LLC filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. Additionally, the series LLC has only one Delaware ‘annual report fee’ regardless of how many series it contains. Interestingly, the series LLC does not have its own chapter in the Delaware code, like limited partnerships, instead, most of the provisions are packed in just one ‘magical’ section of the Delaware LLC Act, 6 Del. C. Section 18-215. Therefore at its core all of the other Delaware LLC Act provisions apply to the series, but there are a number of innovations that allow this entity to multiply internally to have an unlimited number of tentacles, each with a separate purpose and separate assets and liabilities. This is like a blank check from the Secretary of State, empowering you to create as many entity-like cells under this one umbrella without any additional state filings.Second the series LLC organizational structure can be like a parent with wholly-owned-subsidiaries, because each cell is allowed to contract in its own name, sue and be sued in its own name, obtain separate tax ID numbers, and even make separate tax elections (‘Check the box’ elections on IRS form 8832 or 2553), so one cell could be a partnership, another an s-corp, and another a c-corp.There is also another way a series LLC is unlike either of the two above, which is what makes it so compelling to some who cannot afford to pay and maintain multiple LLCs. The Delaware series LLC enables operations to be managed under one roof. It enables new series to be opened without additional filings or fees with the Delaware Secretary of State. The founding members associated with the parent company can generally designate members associated with one or more cells and membership interests to only apply to a particular cell. Therefore to use a simple example, ABC Capital LLC can be a one member LLC with Able Adams as a member. It could have Ben Burns be a single member on ABC Capital LLC, series 1; with Christopher Curtis as the member on series 2; David Downing on series 3; and Elizabeth Emery as the member of series 4. Therefore that example is NOT a parent-child relationship, because it is more akin to 5 separately filed LLC’s under one roof. For various reasons, we do not suggest this diversity of ownership, because it is unwieldy and runs a high potential for conflict.The above example is extreme, but it illustrates that the cell members typically own not only a founding membership interest in the company, but also a membership interest in the cells. Therefore in the ‘cascade of power’ the power does not necessarily flow down from the top. Instead each cell is in many respects autonomous, depending how the series LLC agreement and cell operating agreements are written.Series LLC OriginTo understand the unique purpose of a series LLC and its advantages compared to a traditional LLC, corporation, or partnership, it is important to understand the context in which the series LLC was developed. It was started as special interest legislation of the mutual fund industry, which wanted to have protections and benefits of multiple LLCs contained in a single entity. The SEC securities attorneys for the mutual fund industry are largely responsible for the enactment of the series LLC. The mutual fund industry was tired of having the expense and hassle of filing separate SEC filings for each class of funds under the mutual fund company’s umbrella. Their solution was to create an LLC that would be like a potential cell company which could have daughter funds all within one SEC filing. However these companies were concerned about liability separateness and the right of each fund to be managed independently. Their solution was to add provisions which allow each class of funds to sue and be sued in their own name and to contract in the name of each fund. This concept was not foreign to the law, since the statutory trust already had the ‘series’ feature. Around the same time, since some funds were run as limited partnerships, the series language was also added to that section of the code.Since few people use statutory trust series or limited partnerships series for small businesses, those series sections have garnered little attention. They are still used mainly for the investment and asset holding community. However the LLC has grown significantly in popularity, eclipsing the traditional corporation as the business structure of choice for small business owners. The business community has become comfortable with the ‘traditional LLC’ (which is the term I use to call an LLC without the ‘series’ feature), so much so that there is a demand for many LLCs simply to hold particular assets or business operations. Sometimes the administrative burdens and incremented costs of maintaining separate entities becomes too much. When the entrepreneur needs a solution to reduce costs the series LLC is one vehicle that has multiple self-contained entity-like series within it. This helps to control costs and streamline some administrative burdens.     Basic Series LLC Agreement StructureOperating AgreementsThe Delaware LLC Act provides for “maximum flexibility” and “freedom of contract” with regard to the LLC Operating Agreement. In the majority of series LLC Operating Agreements, the Agreement provides for a top-level membership known as “Founders” and a second tier of members called “separate series members” for the purpose of this information we are referring to these as separate cell members. We suggest that these top-level founding members be the same people as the second tier members for a “mirror-image” of ownership to prevent problems with rogue members owning slivers of interest of one cell, but not others, who may be more prone to litigating against the other members and therefore tying up all the assets of the LLC in a litigation that should be limited to particular assets. While it is theoretically possible to remove the unrelated series from the lawsuit if they are not properly tied to the dispute, as a practical matter, even the cost of such a motion is burdensome and the outcome is uncertain.AmendmentsIn a traditional LLC, as well as a series LLC, any changes to the Operating Agreement are accomplished through amendments. While these are usually in writing and executed by every member of an LLC, it is possible that the cell Operating Agreement contains different provisions for amendment by supermajority of founders plus members associated with a cell or it can require unanimous consent. Some agreements also provide for simple majority. Delaware’s maximum deference to freedom of contract given to the series LLC Operating Agreements provides LLCs with the flexibility to choose whatever amendment procedure they believe is best at the outset.Members Associated with Company or SeriesOne of the primary benefits of having a series LLC is the ability to have different members for different series, and the possibility of having members who are only associated with the company generally and not the cells, or members that are only associated with a cell and not the company generally. This flexibility of membership can be used for a variety of purposes, although a more simple structure may be advisable in most cases (see Section II.A)    Series LLC EvolutionDifferent ApplicationsIn Delaware, and the handful of other states that have series LLC statutes, these internal liability shields will most likely be respected, as they will be supported by both Delaware case law and the Delaware statutes themselves. Exporting the cells to a non-series jurisdiction is prone to a risk that the non-series state court would not regard the separate series and impute joint and several liabilities. An out-of-state judge may decide not to import Delaware law for matters that are outside the scope of the ‘internal affairs doctrine’. Based on conflict of laws principles, the judge could decide that empowering members of the series LLC to establish cell protections without new additional filings with the secretary of state is a violation of public policy in that state and decide not to follow it, even though the U.S. Constitutional precedents suggest the cell protection should be honored, based on a whole host of doctrines such as full faith and credit, equal protection, substantive due process, and the personhood status granted to entities.In any case, the odds of being ‘the first patient on the table’ are low, like playing the lottery, and will likely also give the vast majority of series LLC owners the opportunity to transfer property out of a series if there is a wave of negative case law from non-series states. The trend at the moment is in favor of the series LLC. A few states have adopted series LLC acts recently. Many view the California Franchise Tax Board (‘FTB’) ruling as a positive development (requiring a franchise tax from each series within an LLC as though it were a separate LLC). While the FTB ruling in California may impose additional fees, the ruling also recognizes the series as though they were separate LLCs (at least for tax purposes). This would make it easier for a defendant to make the argument that separate series should also be separate for liability reasons; otherwise, California is taxing a privilege it is not affording. Additionally, the Uniform Law Committee is now drafting series provisions to add to the Uniform LLC Act.Finally, an important point to keep in mind when thinking about possible taxation and legal issues of the series LLC is that many of these decisions rely on the different series being completely separate from each other. This means that each series would have separate records and an objective method to determine which assets and liabilities are in which series. Creating this visible separation is vital to being able to have the different series be considered as distinct legal entities.CourtsCurrently, it is unclear how some court systems will handle series LLCs. In states where the series is, by statute, a separate legal entity, it seems obvious that the state court system would recognize it as such. In other state courts or in Federal Court, this would lead to an uncertain outcome because they would not have series LLC provisions as part of the law that they are applying. However, the series LLC does present an interesting question about service of process. If a series is to be sued, is it necessary to serve the series itself, or is serving the parent LLC sufficient, or required? Additionally, is service on a cell enough to satisfy service on the parent LLC, or is it necessary to serve the parent itself? Currently, the whole series LLC has one Registered Agent, which is listed on the series LLC Certificate of Formation, meaning that there is only one Agent to receive service. The series LLC still has a few kinks to iron out with respect to the courts, although it is likely that future rulings of the Delaware Chancery Court will begin to set precedent as the series LLC becomes a more widespread entity structure.IRSIn 2010, after a number of states had already adopted series LLC provisions, the IRS noticed that it posed a problem for taxpayers. While it had already been settled that the traditional LLC could elect to be taxed in a variety of ways through ‘check the box’ regulations, it was uncertain whether the series would qualify as distinct legal entities who could elect their treatment for tax purposes, or if they would have to assume the tax classification of the company generally and be taxed as an individual entity or if the whole series LLC, including the cells and the company, would be taxed as a single entity. Consequently, the IRS issued a private letter ruling, which states that different cells are allowed to choose their own treatment for tax purposes, based on their individual businesses and membership structures (disregarded entity, partnership, C-Corp, or S-Corp). Thus, a cell can elect how it is to be treated for Federal Income Tax as a business entity that is distinct from the other cells of the same LLC.In 2010, the IRS circulated a proposed revenue rule to provide taxpayers guidance on the series LLC (2010-22793). In it the IRS said it deemed the separate series to be separate taxable entities. This gave the series LLC a great deal more certainty about how to file returns. However, this may require filing an additional partnership tax return (1065) for each additional series. Some considered an advantage of the series to be the ability to file a single consolidated return. However, it appears now that this is not the preferred method, to date the IRS still has not finalized that proposed revenue ruling.BankruptcyIn the case where a single series is insolvent, would the company generally need to be associated with the petition for bankruptcy or can individual cells file for protection? So far, only one Delaware series LLC, Dominion Ventures LLC, has been in bankruptcy court where the company and all of its series filed for Chapter 11 and the Court appointed a trustee by consent of all parties. This case started in the Court of Chancery. Going through court-ordered arbitration resulted in no liability except the requirement to produce books and records. Because this business was investing in mobile home parks and could not get more investors or more loans, and because of litigation costs, it has to file for protection. This test ‘case’ shows the competency of the court to handle the unique issues presented by the series LLC. The Court of Chancery mediation was appealed by the company and is currently stayed pending a final determination by the bankruptcy court.These questions are currently being considered by the Uniform Laws Committee. While Delaware’s statute does provide that dissolution of a cell does not affect other cells or the company and that the winding up and dissolution of the company requires the winding up and dissolution of all cells under that company, there still would have to be a consistent precedent for Bankruptcy Court to follow.The Bankruptcy Court has ruled that ‘[An LLC] is a form of legal entity that has attributes of both a corporation and a partnership…corporations and partnerships are allowed to be debtors, and because an LLC draws its character from both of those…an LLC is similar enough to those entities that it may be a debtor under this code’. Combining the fact that a cell is arguably a legal entity and has characteristics similar to existing entities that are allowed to be debtors (such as LLCs themselves), it would appear that a cell could be a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code. Provided the cell and company as a whole were not cross-collateralizing assets but were treating each other at arm’s length with separate records, than the cell should be regarded and not consolidated into a single bankruptcy estate.    Series LLC TodaySeries LLC in Delaware Versus Other StatesThe Delaware series LLC is the most cutting-edge entity on the market. The series LLC is a product of the Delaware legislature, the most highly regarded body for drafting corporate laws. When forming a company, business formers have a choice of jurisdictions. Many knowledgeable entrepreneurs and real estate investors have chosen Delaware because of its low costs, business-friendly courts, innovative laws, developed legal precedent from the Chancery Court, and dependable liability protection.Keeping beneficial owners’ and managers’ names off of public filings is another benefit of the Delaware series LLC. Only the name of the LLC and the Registered Agent’s name are listed with the State of Delaware (not the member’s name). Only the Registered Agent’s information will be filed with the Secretary of State. This provides owners and managers with a large degree of comfort. Only the registered agent must maintain a contract name, email, phone, and address on a contact person for each LLC. However, other states such as Illinois require that each separate cell file a Certificate of Designation naming members or managers, which becomes public record.Another one of the main advantages that the Delaware series LLC has over that series LLCs filed elsewhere is the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is a dedicated equity court. Only two other states in the U.S.A. have dedicated equity courts (Tennessee and Mississippi), with a third, New Jersey, having equity divisions in its municipal court system. This has given Delaware one of the highest volumes of precedent for decisions about business disputes. With Delaware’s highly developed case law about LLCs, it is likely that court opinions around the country on the series LLC will be based on cases decided in Delaware.Finally, Delaware series LLCs only have to pay one franchise tax for the whole LLC every year, rather than having to pay a separate fee for each cell. This will lower the overhead costs of a series LLC compared to opening multiple LLCs. Additionally, Incnow as well as a few other registered agent services, will only charge a single yearly registered agent fee for a series LLC, rather than multiple fees for multiple traditional LLCs.Names of Managers, Members, and "Cells"Each cell should draft and execute its own Operating Agreement, which is separate from that of the company generally. While the company’s Operating Agreement can set out names of cells by creating them and some basic provisions, the cells will have their names and purposes in their own Addendums to the company agreement. Each Addendum Agreement will also set out the members and managers of the cell, as it is likely that they will be different from the company generally. However, most states require that the name of the cells contain the name of the company generally, although it is possible that each series could file a separate d/b/a.Membership Interests - Admission of Members, Creating New Interests, Transfer/Disposition of InterestsLike a traditional LLC, the requirements and procedure for admission of new members, creating new interests in the LLC, and transferring or assigning interests will be set forth in the Operating Agreement of a series LLC.It is unusual to have different provisions for adding members or transferring their interest within the same series LLC. Frequently the series LLC Operating Agreement requires that all members of the company generally and their particular series approve of any new members. In the absence of a provision requiring pre-approval of new members, such interests are freely transferrable. Other transfers are subject to a right of first refusal by the company first, and the series members and company members second. Many series agreements contain a “supremacy clause” where in the event of a conflict between the series agreement and the company agreement, the company agreement controls.Distribution of Profits and LossesBecause the company and each cell could have different members and ownership structure, each one could have a different plan for distribution of profits and losses set forth in the Operating Agreement. Many LLCs and cells would default to distribution of profits and losses in proportion to ownership or capital contribution; however, for one reason or another, some LLCs would like different allocations.Dispute ResolutionThe Operating Agreement often contains a provision that requires series or the parent to submit to binding arbitration governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association in the event of a dispute. Regardless, providing a dispute resolution process in the Operating Agreements for a series LLC could save hassle in the event of disputes. One disadvantage of the alternate dispute resolution clauses is that they have probably led to fewer reported cases on the series LLC.Liability and Fiduciary DutiesUnder the Delaware LLC Act, members are not liable for the liabilities of either a series or an LLC. However, Delaware and most other states do allow for a member to be designated as liable for the liabilities of the LLC in either the Certificate of Formation or the Operating Agreement, although almost no LLCs choose to do this. Additionally, as the Delaware LLC Act provides, the company generally is not liable for the liabilities incurred by its cells, and series are not liable for liabilities incurred by other cells therein, or the company generally. When the rubber hits the road and there is a problem, it is possible that bad facts may make bad law. In the event of fraud, or other limited circumstances, it is possible for a judge to get creative and allow a creditor recourse against all LLC assets. To avoid problems, it is best to keep your LLC free of unscrupulous activities or any activity that may be a lightning rod for liability. The series in general is better suited to “cold assets” that are passive and unlikely to result in injury to a third party. It is also wise and advisable to have (1) a well-crafted Operating Agreement, (2) a history of booking transactions into separate series records, and (3) documentation of Agreements between series for transactions conducted between series.Regarding the fiduciary duties that members and managers owe to both the LLC and each other, Delaware allows for fiduciary duties to be reduced or heightened in the Operating Agreement. However, members of a cell are subject to the same default fiduciary duties in series LLCs as they would be in regular LLCs. It should also be noted that it is possible that a majority of controlling members of one cell may owe duties not only to the minority members of that cell, but possibly other cells, depending on how the series is organized. There may be separate cross duties of loyalty and care between cells to look out for. For example, a manager of a series LLC may wear many hats as manager of each individual cell and should be aware of conflicts that could arise.    Series LLCs Doing Business in "Non-series" StatesWhen cells do business in non-series states, it is best that they limit their activity and exposure. A majority of cells surveyed are using their cells in more than one state. One idea is to establish a cell of the LLC in each state where you do business and be particularly careful when you use multiple LLCs in any particular state without series provisions with the understanding that should there be a lawsuit, you will need to explain the series concept to a judge that is likely unfamiliar with the concept.    Series LLCs TomorrowModel Series ProvisionsCurrently, the Uniform Law Commission has a Uniform LLC Act, which every state has adopted in some form. This Uniform LLC Act has no series provisions. However, the Uniform Laws Committee does currently have a “Series of Unincorporated Business Entities” Committee, which “will draft series provisions that can be added to some or all of the uniform unincorporated business organization acts other than the Uniform Statutory Trust Act”, as well as adding series provisions to the USTEA.50 StatesOnce a Uniform series LLC Act is created and endorsed by the Commission, it is likely that more states will start adopting the series LLC. Many states have been waiting for just this endorsement. Other states that are rich in oil and gas reserves have already adopted the legislation because it is a favored method to develop natural gas exploration projects, where each project or different phase of a project is designated into a particular cell.The states have adopted two approaches to the series. In the Delaware model, only one entity is filed. No series needs to be specifically filed or designated with the State of formation. In the Illinois model, each cell must file a certificate of designation and pay a fee for each additional series. All other states with the series LLC have followed the Delaware model except for Illinois, Missouri, and Montana, yet many states have modified it slightly. Therefore if you form a series LLC, it is best to do so in Delaware.InternationalDelaware is not only exporting its series LLCs to other states, but also around the world. In a recent poll of 1,000 series LLCs, 20 percent of the respondents were using their series LLCs outside the United States. Reviewing the names on some series, they appear to be used in solar farms, wind turbines, gas development and primarily by the energy sector. Many are also using the series LLC for global real estate investments.

	CFSELTI. The Financed Student Loans are to be serviced by Collegiate Funding
	Master Servicing, L.L.C. (the "Master Servicer") pursuant to a Servicing
	Agreement, to be dated as of July 1, 2005 (as amended and supplemented from time

	Agreement, to be dated as of July 1, 2005 (as amended and supplemented from time
	to time, the "Sub-Servicing Agreement"), with CFS-SunTech Servicing LLC
	("CFS-SunTech" or, in its capacity as sub-servicer, the "Sub-Servicer") pursuant
	to which the Sub-Servicer will service all of the Financed Student Loans on

	are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Registration Statements," and
	the prospectus included in such Registration Statements, as supplemented to
	reflect the terms of the Notes as first filed with the Commission after the date
	of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b), are
	hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus," a "preliminary
	prospectus" means any form of prospectus, including any prospectus supplement,
	relating to the Notes used prior to the date of this Agreement that is subject
	to completion; the "Base Prospectus" means the base prospectus to be dated on or
	about June 23, 2005, included in the Prospectus; the "Prospectus Supplement"
	means the prospectus supplement to be dated on or about July 13, 2005, included
	in the Prospectus.


	          (b) On the effective
	date of each Registration Statement, the respective Registration Statement and
	the Prospectus conformed in all respects to the requirements of the Act, the
	Rules and Regulations and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
	"Trust Indenture Act"), and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, and, except
	with respect to information omitted pursuant to Rule 430A of the Act, did not
	include any untrue statement of a material fact or, in the case of the
	Registration Statements, omit to state any material fact required to be stated
	therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and, in the
	case of the Prospectus, omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
	statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
	made, not misleading, and on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date,
	the Registration Statements and the Prospectus will conform in all respects to
	the requirements of the Act, the Rules and Regulations and the Trust Indenture
	Act, and none of such documents included or will include any untrue statement of
	a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
	or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however,
	that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from the
	Registration Statements or the Prospectus based upon written information
	furnished by the Underwriters (as described in Section 7(b) hereof),
	specifically for use therein.


	          (c) The Notes are
	"asset backed securities" within the meaning of, and satisfy the requirements
	for use of, Form S-3 under the Act, as set forth in the General Instructions to
	Form S-3, and the conditions of Rule 415 of the Act have been satisfied with
	respect to the Registration Statements. The Commission has not issued and, to
	the best knowledge of the Sponsor, is not threatening to issue any order
	preventing or suspending the use of the Registration Statements.


	          (d) The documents
	incorporated by reference in the Registration Statements and Prospectus, when
	they become effective or hereafter become effective, or at the time they were or
	hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all
	material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules
	and Regulations thereunder and none of such documents contained an untrue
	statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
	stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

	material adverse affect on Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the
	Master Servicer or the Administrator, as applicable, or on its ability to
	perform its obligations under the Basic Documents.


	          (f) This Agreement
	and each of the other Basic Documents to which Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor,

	constitute a valid and binding agreement of Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the
	Sellers, the Master Servicer and the Administrator, respectively, enforceable
	against Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer and
	the Administrator, respectively, in accordance with its terms, subject as to the
	enforcement of remedies (i) to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
	reorganization, moratorium, and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
	generally; (ii) to general principles of equity (regardless of and whether the
	enforcement of such remedies is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
	and (iii) with respect to rights of indemnity under this Agreement, to
	limitations of public policy under applicable securities laws.


	          (g) None of
	Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the
	Administrator is in breach or violation of (i) its organizational documents or
	(ii) any indenture, mortgage, deed or trust, lease, credit or security agreement
	or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its
	properties may be bound, or in violation of any applicable law, statute,
	regulation or ordinance or any governmental body having jurisdiction over it,
	except where such breach or violation would not have a material adverse affect
	on Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the
	Administrator, as applicable, or in its ability to perform its obligations under
	the Basic Documents.


	          (h) Other than as
	contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed in the Prospectus, there is no
	broker, finder or other party that is entitled to receive from the Sponsor, or
	any affiliate thereof or the Underwriters, any brokerage or finder's fee or
	other fee or commission as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
	this Agreement.


	          (i) Neither the
	Sponsor nor any of its affiliates has entered into, nor will it enter into, any
	contractual arrangement with respect to the distribution of the Notes, except
	for this Agreement.


	          (j) The Trust is not
	an "investment company" and is not required to be registered as an "investment
	company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
	amended (the "Investment Company Act").


	          (k) As of the
	Closing Date (as defined below), the representations and warranties of
	Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer and the
	Administrator, in each of their respective capacities under each of the Basic
	Documents to which they are a party, will be true and correct in all material
	respects as of the date of such representation or warranty was given and each
	such representation and warranty is so incorporated herein by this reference.


	          (l) The Trust's
	assignment of the Collateral to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture
	will vest in the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders, a first
	priority perfected security interest therein, subject to no other outstanding
	Lien.


	          (m) The Notes have
	been duly authorized on behalf of the Trust. The Notes, when duly and validly
	executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the Indenture, and
	delivered and paid for pursuant hereto, will constitute legally valid and
	binding obligations of the Trust, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and
	enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject as to enforceability to the
	effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
	conveyance, moratorium and similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
	creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (whether
	in a proceeding at law or in equity).


	          (n) Neither the
	execution, delivery or performance of any of the Basic Documents by Collegiate
	Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the Administrator, nor
	the issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes, nor the fulfillment of the terms
	of the Notes, will conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or
	acceleration of, or constitute a default under, any term or provision of the
	formation documents of Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master
	Servicer or the Administrator, any material indenture or other material
	agreement or instrument to which Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers,
	the Master Servicer or the Administrator is a party or by which any of them or
	their properties is bound or result in a violation of or contravene the terms of
	any statute, order or regulation applicable to Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor,
	the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the Administrator of any court, regulatory
	body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction
	over Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the
	Administrator, or will result in the creation of any lien upon any material
	property or assets of Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master
	Servicer or the Administrator (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents).


	          (o) Other than as
	disclosed in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings
	pending to which Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master
	Servicer or the Administrator is a party or of which any of its properties is
	the subject, which, if determined adversely to Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor,
	the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the Administrator, would individually or in
	the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
	shareholders' equity or results of operations of any of them; and, to the best
	of Collegiate Funding's and the Sponsor's knowledge, no such proceedings are
	threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or others.


	          (p) No consent,
	license, approval, authorization or order of or declaration or filing with any
	governmental authority is required for the issuance of the Notes or sale of the
	Notes or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this
	Agreement or the other Basic Documents, except for state securities or Blue Sky
	laws and except such as have been or will have been prior to the Closing Date
	duly made or obtained.


	          (q) Since the
	respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statements
	and the Prospectus, as amended prior to the date hereof, there has not been any
	material adverse change, or any development which could reasonably be expected
	to result in a material adverse change, in or affecting the financial position,
	shareholders' equity or results of operations of Collegiate Funding, the
	Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer or the Administrator, or Collegiate
	Funding's, the Sponsor's, the Sellers', the Servicer's or the Administrator's
	ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
	Basic Documents to which it is a party.


	          (r) Any taxes, fees
	and other governmental charges owed by Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the
	Sellers, the Master Servicer, the Administrator or the Trust due on or prior to
	the Closing Date (including, without limitation, sales taxes) in connection with
	the execution, delivery and issuance of this Agreement, the other Basic
	Documents and the Notes have been or will have been paid at or prior to the
	Closing Date, except for taxes, fees and other governmental charges in respect
	of which the validity thereof will be contested in good faith by appropriate
	proceedings.


	          (s) Under generally
	accepted accounting principles, (i) each Seller will report its transfer of the
	Financed Student Loans transferred by it to the Sponsor pursuant to its Seller
	Student Loan Purchase Agreement as a sale of the Financed Student Loans for
	financial accounting purposes and (ii) the Sponsor will report its transfer of
	the Financed Student Loans to the Trust pursuant to the Sponsor Student Loan
	Purchase Agreement as a sale of the Financed Student Loans for financial
	accounting purposes (it being understood, however, that the sales described in
	clauses (i) and (ii) may not be recognized for accounting purposes due to the
	application of consolidated financial reporting).


	          (t) Immediately
	prior to the transfer thereof by each Seller to the Sponsor, each Seller will be
	the sole owner of all right, title and interest in, and will have good and
	marketable title to, the Financed Student Loans to be transferred to the
	Sponsor. Pursuant to the Seller Student Loan Purchase Agreements, each Seller
	will transfer to the Sponsor ownership of the Financed Student Loans.
	Immediately prior to the transfer thereof to the Trust, the Sponsor will be the
	sole owner of all right, title and interest in, and will have good and
	marketable title to, the Financed Student Loans. The assignment of the Financed
	Student Loans, all documents and instruments relating thereto and all proceeds
	thereof to the Trust, pursuant to the Sponsor Student Loan Purchase Agreement,
	vests in the Indenture Trustee and the Eligible Lender Trustee, as appropriate,
	on behalf of the Trust all interests which are purported to be conveyed thereby,
	free and clear of any liens, security interests or encumbrances, other than
	those contemplated by the Basic Documents.


	          (u) Immediately upon
	the transfer of Financed Student Loans by the Sellers to the Sponsor pursuant to
	the Seller Student Loan Purchase Agreements, the Sponsor's interest in such
	Financed Student Loans and the proceeds thereof shall be perfected by the filing
	of UCC-1 financing statements naming each Seller and its eligible lender
	trustee, as debtors, the Sponsor and its eligible lender trustee, as secured
	parties, and the Indenture Trustee, as assignee (the "Seller Financing
	Statements") in the offices specified in Schedule I and there shall be no
	unreleased UCC financing statements filed against the Sellers or their eligible
	lender trustees in such Financed Student Loans other than the Seller Financing
	Statements. If a court concludes that the transfer of such Financed Student
	Loans from the Sellers to the Sponsor is a sale, the interest of the Sponsor in
	the Financed Student Loans and the proceeds thereof will be perfected upon
	filing of the Seller Financing Statements in the offices specified in Schedule
	I. If a court concludes that such transfer is not a sale, the Seller Student
	Loan Purchase Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby shall
	constitute a grant by the Sellers to the Sponsor of a valid security interest in
	the Financed Student Loans and the proceeds thereof, which security interest
	will be perfected upon filing of the Seller Financing Statements in the offices
	specified in Schedule I. No filing or other action, other than the filing of the
	Seller Financing Statements in the offices specified in Schedule I and any
	related continuation statements, is necessary to perfect and maintain the
	interest or the security interest of the Sponsor in the Financed Student Loans
	and the proceeds thereof against third parties.


	          (v) Immediately upon
	the transfer of the Financed Student Loans by the Sponsor to the Trust pursuant
	to the Sponsor Student Loan Purchase Agreement, the Trust's interest in the
	Financed Student Loans and the proceeds thereof shall be perfected by the filing
	of UCC-1 Financing Statements naming the Sponsor and its eligible lender
	trustee, as debtors, the Trust and the Eligible Lender Trustee, as secured
	parties, and the Indenture Trustee, as assignee (the "Sponsor Financing
	Statements") in the offices specified in Schedule I and there shall be no
	unreleased UCC financing statements filed against the Sponsor or its eligible
	lender trustee in the Financed Student Loans other than the Sponsor Financing
	Statements. If a court concludes that the transfer of the Financed Student Loans
	from the Sponsor to the Trust is a sale, the interest of the Trust in the
	Financed Student Loans and the proceeds thereof will be perfected upon filing of
	the Seller Financing Statements in the offices specified in Schedule I. If a
	court concludes that such transfer is not a sale, the Sponsor Student Loan
	Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby constitute a grant
	by the Sponsor to the Trust of a valid security interest in the Financed Student
	Loans and the proceeds thereof, which security interest will be perfected upon
	the filing of the Sponsor Financing Statements in the offices specified in
	Schedule I. No filing or other action, other than the filing of the Sponsor
	Financing Statements in the offices specified in Schedule I and any related
	continuation statements, is necessary to perfect and maintain the interest or
	the security interest of the Trust in the Financed Student Loans and the
	proceeds thereof against third parties.


	          (w) The Indenture
	and the transactions contemplated thereby constitute a grant by the Trust and
	the Eligible Lender Trustee to the Indenture Trustee of a valid security
	interest in the Collateral and the proceeds thereof, which security interest
	will be perfected upon the filing of UCC-1 Financing Statements naming the Trust
	and the Eligible Lender Trustee, as debtors, and the Indenture Trustee, as
	secured party (the "Trust Financing Statements"), in the offices specified in
	Schedule I and there shall be no unreleased UCC financing statements filed
	against the Trust or the Eligible Lender Trustee in the Collateral other than
	the Trust Financing Statements. No filing or other action, other than the filing
	of the Trust Financing Statements and any related continuation statements, is
	necessary to perfect and maintain the interest or the security interest of the
	Indenture Trustee in the Collateral and the proceeds thereof against third
	parties.


	          (x) The Trust
	Agreement need not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.


	          (y) The Indenture
	has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.


	          (z) The Sponsor and
	Collegiate Funding acknowledge and agree that the Underwriters are acting solely
	in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Sponsor and
	Collegiate Funding with respect to the offering of the Notes contemplated hereby
	(including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as
	a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Sponsor, Collegiate
	Funding or any other person. Additionally, none of the Underwriters is advising
	the Sponsor, Collegiate Funding or any other person as to any legal, tax,
	investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Sponsor
	and Collegiate Funding shall consult with their own advisors concerning such
	matters and shall be responsible for making their own independent investigation
	and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters
	shall have no responsibility or liability to the Sponsor or Collegiate Funding
	with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Sponsor or
	Collegiate Funding, the transaction contemplated hereby or other matters
	relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the
	Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Sponsor or Collegiate
	Funding.






	          
	3.

	Purchase, Sale and Delivery of the Notes.

	On the basis of the
	representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, but subject to the
	terms and conditions herein set forth, the Sponsor agrees to cause the Trust to
	sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agree, severally and not jointly,
	to purchase from the Trust, the principal amount of each class of Notes set
	forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on Schedule II hereto at a purchase
	price equal to the product of the "Price %" as specified on Schedule III hereto
	for such class of Notes and the principal amount of each class of Notes set
	forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on Schedule II hereto. The Notes
	shall mature on the dates, and shall bear interest at the respective rates,
	described in the Prospectus Supplement.




	          The
	Sponsor will deliver the Notes to the Underwriters, against payment of the
	purchase price to or upon the order of the Sponsor by wire transfer in federal
	(same day) funds, at the office of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan
	LLP, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038, at 10:00 a.m.,
	New York time on July 20, 2005, or at such other time not later than
	seven full business days thereafter as the Underwriters and the Sponsor agree in
	writing, such time being herein referred to as the Closing Date. The
	Notes to be so delivered will be initially represented by one or more Notes
	registered in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC. The interests
	of beneficial owners of the Notes will be represented by book entries on the
	records of DTC and participating members thereof. Definitive Notes will be
	available only under the limited circumstances specified in the Basic Documents.




	          
	4.

	Offering by Underwriters.

	It is understood that the Underwriters propose to
	offer the Notes for sale to the public (which may include selected dealers) on
	the terms set forth in the Prospectus.




	          
	5.

	Covenants of the Sponsor.

	The Sponsor covenants and agrees with the
	Underwriters that:







	          (a)
	The Sponsor will file the Prospectus in a form approved by the Underwriters with
	the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with subparagraph (2) (or, if
	applicable and if consented to by the Underwriters, subparagraph (5)) of Rule
	424(b) no later than the second business day following the execution and
	delivery of this Agreement. The Sponsor will advise the Underwriters promptly of
	any such filing pursuant to Rule 424(b).


	          (b) The Sponsor will
	advise the Underwriters promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement either
	Registration Statement or the Prospectus in connection with the offering of the
	Notes and will not effect such amendment or supplementation without the consent
	of the Underwriters, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
	delayed; and the Sponsor will advise the Underwriters promptly of any amendment
	or supplementation of either Registration Statement or the Prospectus in
	connection with the offering of the Notes and of the institution by the
	Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of either Registration
	Statement and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop
	order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.


	          (c) If, at any time
	when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered by an
	Underwriter or dealer, either (i) any event occurs as a result of which the
	Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of
	a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
	the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
	made, not misleading, or (ii) for any other reason it shall be necessary to
	amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Sponsor promptly
	will notify the Underwriters of such event and promptly will prepare, at its own
	expense, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or
	omission. Neither the Underwriters' consent to, nor the Underwriters'
	distribution of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall constitute a
	waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof.


	          (d) The Sponsor
	will, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an underwriter or dealer is
	required by the Act, furnish to the Underwriters copies of any preliminary
	prospectus, the Prospectus, the Registration Statements and all amendments and
	supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such
	quantities as the Underwriters reasonably request.


	          (e) The Sponsor will
	take all actions which are necessary to arrange for the qualification of the
	Notes for offering and sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the
	Underwriters designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long
	as required under such laws for the distribution of the Notes; provided,
	however, that in no event shall the Sponsor be obligated to qualify as a foreign
	corporation or to execute a general or unlimited consent or take any action that
	would subject it to service of process in any such jurisdiction.


	          (f) The Sponsor
	shall, at all times upon request of the Underwriters or their advisors, or both,
	from the date hereof through the Closing Date, (i) make available to the
	Underwriters or its advisors, or both, prior to acceptance of its purchase, such
	information (in addition to that contained in the Registration Statements and
	the Prospectus) concerning the offering, the Sponsor and any other relevant
	matters as they possess or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense,
	including any and all documentation requested in connection with its due
	diligence efforts regarding information in the Registration Statements and the
	Prospectus and in order to evidence the accuracy or completeness of any of the
	conditions contained in this Agreement and (ii) provide the Underwriters or its
	advisors, or both, prior to acceptance of its subscription, the reasonable
	opportunity to ask questions of Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Seller, the
	Master Servicer and the Administrator with respect to such matters.


	          (g) Until the
	retirement of the Notes, the Sponsor will deliver to the Underwriters the annual
	statements of compliance and the annual independent certified public
	accountants' reports furnished to the Indenture Trustee or the Eligible Lender
	Trustee pursuant to the Basic Documents, as soon as such statements and reports
	are furnished to the Indenture Trustee or the Eligible Lender Trustee.


	          (h) So long as any
	of the Notes are outstanding, the Sponsor will furnish to the Underwriters as
	soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal year, all documents required to
	be distributed to Noteholders or filed with the Commission on behalf of the
	Sponsor pursuant to the Exchange Act, or any order of the Commission thereunder.


	          (i) On or before the
	Closing Date (or, in the case of Financed Student Loans to be acquired after by
	the Trust from the Sponsor pursuant to the Sponsor Student Loan Purchase
	Agreement after the Closing Date, on or before the date of such acquisition),
	the Sponsor shall cause the computer records of the Sponsor, the Sellers, the
	Master Servicer, the Sub-Servicer, the Custodian, the Originating Agent and the
	Administrator relating to the Financed Student Loans to show the ownership by
	the Eligible Lender Trustee on behalf of the Trust of the Financed Student
	Loans, and from and after the Closing Date (or such later date of acquisition)
	none of the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer, the Sub-Servicer, the
	Custodian, the Originating Agent or the Administrator shall take any action
	inconsistent with the ownership by the Eligible Lender Trustee on behalf of the
	Trust of such Financed Student Loans, other than as permitted by the Master
	Servicing Agreement.


	          (j) To the extent,
	if any, that any of the ratings provided with respect to the Notes by the rating
	agency or agencies that initially rate any of the Notes are conditioned upon the
	furnishing of documents or the taking of any other actions by the Sponsor, the
	Sellers, the Master Servicer, the Sub-Servicer, the Custodian, the Originating
	Agent or the Administrator on or prior to the Closing Date, the Sponsor shall or
	shall cause the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer, the Sub-Servicer, the
	Custodian, the Originating Agent or the Administrator, as applicable, to furnish
	such documents and take any such other actions. A copy of any such documents
	shall be provided to the Underwriters at the time it is delivered to the rating
	agencies.


	          (k) The Sponsor will
	cause the Trust to pay from amounts deposited into the Acquisition Fund on the
	Closing Date, or to the extent such amounts are not sufficient, the Sponsor will
	pay, all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this
	Agreement, including, with limitation, (i) the printing and filing of the
	documents (including the Registration Statements and the Prospectus); (ii) the
	preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters; (iii) the
	fees and disbursements of Collegiate Funding's, the Sponsor's, the Sellers', the
	Master Servicer's and the Administrator's counsel (including without limitation,
	local counsel) and accountants; (iv) the qualification of the Notes under state
	securities laws, including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of counsel
	for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the
	preparation of any blue sky or legal investment survey, if any is requested; (v)
	the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Registration
	Statements and the Prospectus and each amendment thereto; (vi) the reasonable
	expenses of the Underwriters (other than its counsel); (vii) the fees and
	reasonable expenses of counsel to the Underwriters, (viii) any fees charged by
	rating agencies for the rating of the Notes, (ix) the fees and expenses of the
	Trust and its counsel; and (x) the fees and expenses of the Delaware Trustee,
	the Indenture Trustee and the Eligible Lender Trustee, and each of their
	counsel.


	          (l) The Sponsor will
	cause the Trust to make generally available to holders of Notes, as soon as
	practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective
	date of the Registration Statements (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act),
	an earnings statement of the Trust (which need not be audited) complying with
	Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Sponsor, Rule 158).


	          (m) The Sponsor will
	cooperate with the Underwriters and with their counsel in connection with the
	qualification of, or procurement of exemptions with respect to, the Notes for
	offering and sale by the Underwriters and by dealers under the securities or
	Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will
	file such consents to service of process or other documents necessary or
	appropriate in order to effect such qualification or exemptions; provided that
	in no event shall the Sponsor be obligated to qualify to do business in any
	jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would
	subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the
	offering or sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so
	subject.


	          (n) The Sponsor
	consents to the use, in accordance with the securities or Blue Sky laws of such
	jurisdictions in which the Notes are offered by the Underwriters and by dealers,
	of the Prospectus furnished by the Sponsor.


	          (o) The net proceeds
	from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be applied substantially in accordance
	with the description set forth in the Prospectus.


	          (p) Except as stated
	in this Agreement and in the Prospectus, the Sponsor has not taken, nor will it
	take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that might reasonably be
	expected to cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of the
	Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.


	          (q) For the period
	beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending 90 days hereafter, none of
	the Sponsor, Collegiate Funding or any entity affiliated, directly or
	indirectly, with the Sponsor or Collegiate Funding will, without prior written
	notice to the Underwriters, offer to sell or sell notes (other than the Notes)
	collateralized by student loans; provided, however, that this shall not be
	construed to prevent the sale of student loan applications or student loans by
	Collegiate Funding.


	          (r) If, at the time
	either Registration Statement became effective, any information shall have been
	omitted therefrom in reliance upon Rule 430A under the Act, then, immediately
	following the execution of this Agreement, the Sponsor will prepare, and file or
	transmit for filing with the Commission in accordance with such Rule 430A and
	Rule 424(b) under the Act, copies of an amended Prospectus containing all
	information so omitted.


	          (s) The Sponsor will
	cooperate with the Underwriters in listing and maintaining the Class A-2 Notes,
	the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange.

	          (b) The Prospectus

	the Financed Student Loans or particularly the business or properties of the

	in the sole discretion of the Underwriters, materially impairs the investment
	quality of the Notes; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any securities of
	Collegiate Funding, the Sponsor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer, the
	Sub-Servicer, the Custodian or the Originating Agent, by any "nationally

	the date hereof; (vi) a material disruption has occurred in securities
	settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (vii) any event or

	and their counsel or the Underwriters and their counsel, requires the filing of
	any amendment to or change in the Registration Statements or Prospectus in order
	to state a material fact required by any law to be stated therein or necessary
	in order to make the statements therein not misleading, if amending or
	supplementing the Registration Statements or Prospectus to reflect such event or

	right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies
	with respect to, the property of the Trust except in accordance with the terms
	of the Trust Agreement.


	          (vii) Under the
	Trust Act, the Trust is a separate legal entity and, assuming that the Sponsor
	Student Loan Purchase Agreement conveys good title to the Trust property to the
	Trust as a true sale and not as a security arrangement, the Trust rather than
	the Certificateholders will hold whatever title to the Trust property as may be
	conveyed to it from time to time pursuant to the Sponsor Student Loan Purchase
	Agreement, except to the extent that the Trust has taken action to dispose of or
	otherwise transfer or encumber any part of the Trust property.


	          (viii) Underss.
	3805(c) of the Trust Act, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Trust
	Agreement, a Certificateholder (including the Sponsor in its capacity as such)
	has no interest in specific Trust property.


	          (ix) Underss.
	3808(a) and (b) of the Trust Act, the Trust may not be terminated or revoked by
	any Certificateholder, and the dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of any
	Certificateholder shall not result in the termination or dissolution of the
	Trust, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement.









	          (q)
	The Underwriters shall have received an opinion of counsel to CFS-SunTech, dated
	the Closing Date and satisfactory in form and substance to the Underwriters and
	counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect that:









	          (i)
	CFS-SunTech has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability
	company in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization,
	with full power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business,
	and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
	jurisdiction in which its failure to qualify would have a material adverse
	effect upon transactions contemplated by the Basic Documents and its business or
	the ownership of their property.


	          (ii) The
	Sub-Servicing Agreement, the Custodian Agreements and the Origination Agreement
	have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by CFS-SunTech.


	          (iii) The
	Sub-Servicing Agreement, the Custodian Agreements and the Origination Agreement
	are the legal, valid and binding obligations of CFS-SunTech enforceable against
	CFS-SunTech in accordance with their terms.


	          (iv) Neither the
	execution, delivery and performance by CFS-SunTech of the Sub-Servicing
	Agreement, the Custodian Agreements or the Origination Agreement, nor the
	consummation by CFS-SunTech of the transactions contemplated thereby, will
	conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or
	constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien,
	charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of CFS-SunTech,
	pursuant to the terms of the formation documents of CFS-SunTech or any statute,
	rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body, or any court
	having jurisdiction over CFS-SunTech or its properties, or any agreement or
	instrument known to such counsel after due investigation to which CFS-SunTech is
	a party or by which CFS-SunTech or any of its properties is bound.


	          (v) No
	authorization, license, approval, consent or order of, or filing with, any court
	or governmental agency or authority is necessary in connection with the
	execution, delivery and performance of the Sub-Servicing Agreement, the
	Custodian Agreements or the Origination Agreement.


	          (vi) There are no
	legal or governmental proceedings known to such counsel to be pending to which
	CFS-SunTech is a party or of which any property of CFS-SunTech is the subject,
	nor are any such proceedings known to such counsel to be threatened or
	contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others (i) asserting
	the invalidity of all or any part of the Sub-Servicing Agreement, the Custodian
	Agreements or the Origination Agreement or (ii) that could materially adversely
	affect the ability of CFS-SunTech to perform its obligations under the
	Sub-Servicing Agreement, the Custodian Agreements or the Origination
	Agreement.

	customary in opinions of this type and are reasonably acceptable to counsel to
	the Underwriters.

	7.

	Indemnification and Contribution.








	          (a)
	The Sponsor and Collegiate Funding, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify
	and hold harmless the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls the
	Underwriters within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
	Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the respective affiliates, officers,
	directors and employees of the Underwriters and each such person, against any
	losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the
	Underwriters or such controlling person and the respective affiliates, officers,
	directors and employees of the Underwriters and each such person may become
	subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
	claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
	based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
	contained in the Registration Statements, any Preliminary Prospectus or the
	Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based
	upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary
	to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
	were made, not misleading; except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
	liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
	untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriters
	furnished to the Sponsor in writing by the Underwriters expressly for use
	therein; provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this paragraph
	7(a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit
	of an Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling an Underwriter)
	on account of any such loss, claim, damage or liability arising from the sale of
	the of Notes by an Underwriter to any person if the untrue statement or alleged
	untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in
	such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and such Underwriter
	sold Notes to that person without sending or giving at or prior to the written
	confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or
	supplemented but excluding documents incorporated by reference therein) if
	Collegiate Funding has previously furnished sufficient copies thereof to such
	Underwriter at a time reasonably prior to the date such Notes are sold to such
	person.


	          (b) Each
	Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
	the Sponsor and Collegiate Funding and their directors, officers and each
	Person, if any, who controls the Sponsor or Collegiate Funding within the
	meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
	Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Sponsor to the
	Underwriters set forth in paragraph 7(a) above, but only with reference to
	information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Sponsor in writing by
	such Underwriter expressly for use in any Preliminary Prospectus or the
	Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. The written information
	furnished by the Underwriters to the Sponsor consists solely of the information
	set forth in the second paragraph (excluding the first sentence thereof), the
	first sentence of the fifth paragraph and the eighth paragraph under the heading
	"Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus Supplement (the "Underwriters'
	Information").


	          (c) In case any
	proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted
	involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
	Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly
	notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying
	Party") in writing; provided, however, that the failure to notify the
	Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
	which it may have under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above except to the extent that it
	has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the
	failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
	Party from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise
	than under this Section 7(a) or 7(b) above. The Indemnifying Party, upon request
	of the Indemnified Party, shall retain counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified
	Party to represent the Indemnified Party and any others the Indemnifying Party
	may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and
	disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
	proceeding, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel,
	but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
	Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
	shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named
	parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
	the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both
	parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
	differing interests between them, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
	retain counsel as provided in the preceding sentence. It is understood that the
	Indemnifying Party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any
	Indemnified Party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in
	the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
	separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Indemnified
	Parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are
	incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters, in the
	case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) above, and by the Sponsor
	or Collegiate Funding, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section
	7(b) above. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
	proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
	consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying
	Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or
	liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall,
	without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any
	settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
	Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
	sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (i) does not
	include a statement as to or admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to
	act by or on behalf of any such Indemnified Party, and (ii) includes an
	unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims
	that are the subject matter of such proceeding.


	          (d) To the extent
	the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above is unavailable to
	an Indemnified Party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims,
	damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Party under
	such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall
	contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
	of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is
	appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Sponsor and
	Collegiate Funding on the one hand and an Underwriter on the other hand from the
	offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above
	is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
	reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but
	also the relative fault of the Sponsor or Collegiate Funding on the one hand and
	of an Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or
	omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well
	as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received
	by the Sponsor and Collegiate Funding on the one hand and an Underwriter on the
	other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in
	the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the
	Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Sponsor and the total
	discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter, in each case as set
	forth in the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Notes. The
	relative fault of the Sponsor and Collegiate Funding on the one hand and of an
	Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other
	things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
	omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
	supplied by the Sponsor, Collegiate Funding or by an Underwriter and the
	parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
	correct or prevent such statement or omission.


	          (e) The Sponsor,
	Collegiate Funding and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or
	equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata
	allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
	the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d) above. The amount paid
	or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages
	and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject
	to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably
	incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending
	any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no
	Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
	of its underwriting compensation. No Person guilty of fraudulent
	misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be
	entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
	misrepresentation.






	          
	8.

	Default of Underwriter.

	If, at the Closing, any one or more of the
	Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have
	agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of
	Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or
	refused to purchase is ten percent or less of the aggregate principal amount of
	Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters may make arrangements
	satisfactory to the Underwriters for the purchase of such Notes by other persons
	(who may include one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters), but if no such
	arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be
	obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Notes set
	forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II hereto bears to the
	aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such
	non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters
	may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or
	Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, at the
	Closing, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes
	and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default
	occurs is more than ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be
	purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Sponsor for
	the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this
	Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
	Underwriter or the Sponsor, except as provided in Section 10. In any such case,
	either the Underwriters or the Sponsor shall have the right to postpone the
	Closing, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required
	changes, if any, in the Registration Statements and in the Prospectus or in any
	other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the
	term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this
	Section 8. Any action taken under this Section 8 shall not relieve any
	defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such
	Underwriter under this Agreement.




	          
	9.

	Computational Materials.








	          (a) It
	is understood that the Underwriters may prepare and provide to prospective
	investors certain Computational Materials (as defined below) in connection with
	the offering of the Notes, subject to the following conditions:









	          (i)
	The Underwriters shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in
	connection with the use of Computational Materials including the No-Action
	Letter of May 20, 1994 issued by the Commission to Kidder, Peabody Acceptance
	Corporation I, Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated and Kidder Structured Asset
	Corporation, as made applicable to other issuers and underwriters by the
	Commission in response to the request of the Public Securities Association dated
	May 24, 1994, and the No-Action Letter of February 17, 1995 issued by the
	Commission to the Public Securities Association (collectively, the "Kidder/PSA
	Letters").


	          (ii) As used herein,
	"Computational Materials" and the term "ABS Term Sheets" shall have the meanings
	given such terms in the Kidder/PSA Letters, but shall include only those
	Computational Materials that have been prepared or delivered to prospective
	investors by or at the direction of an Underwriter.


	          (iii) Each
	Underwriter shall provide the Sponsor with representative forms of all
	Computational Materials prior to their first use, to the extent such forms have
	not previously been approved by the Sponsor for use by such Underwriter. Each
	Underwriter shall provide to the Sponsor, for filing on Form 8-K as provided in
	Section 9(b), copies of all Computational Materials that are to be filed with
	the Commission pursuant to the Kidder/PSA Letters. Each Underwriter may provide
	copies of the foregoing in a consolidated or aggregated form. All Computational
	Materials described in this subsection (a)(iii) must be provided to the Sponsor
	not later than 10:00 a.m., New York time, one business day before filing thereof
	is required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.


	          (iv) If an
	Underwriter does not provide the Computational Materials to the Sponsor pursuant
	to subsection (a)(iii) above, such Underwriter shall be deemed to have
	represented, as of the applicable Closing Date, that it did not provide any
	prospective investors with any information in written or electronic form in
	connection with the offering of the Notes that is required to be filed with the
	Commission in accordance with the Kidder/PSA Letters.


	          (v) In the event of
	any delay in the delivery by an Underwriter to the Sponsor of all Computational
	Materials required to be delivered in accordance with subsection (a)(iii) above,
	the Sponsor shall have the right to delay the release of the Prospectus to
	investors or to such Underwriter, to delay the Closing Date and to take other
	appropriate actions in each case as necessary in order to allow the Sponsor to
	comply with its agreement set forth in Section 9(b) to file the Computational
	Materials by the time specified therein.









	          (b)
	The Sponsor shall file the Computational Materials (if any) provided to it by
	the Underwriter under Section 9(a)(iii) with the Commission pursuant to a
	Current Report on Form 8-K no later than 5:30 p.m., New York time, on the date
	required pursuant to the Kidder/PSA Letters.






	          
	10.

	Survival of Representations and Obligations.

	The respective indemnities,
	agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Sponsor and
	Collegiate Funding and their respective officers and of the Underwriters set
	forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or contained in certificates of
	officers of the Sponsor or Collegiate Funding submitted pursuant hereto shall
	remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
	or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the
	Underwriters, the Sponsor, Collegiate Funding or any of their respective
	representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will
	survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. If for any reason the purchase of
	the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Sponsor shall remain
	responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by the Sponsor pursuant to
	Section 5(k) hereof and the respective obligations of the Sponsor, Collegiate
	Funding and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If
	for any reason the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated
	(other than because of a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in items
	(iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 6(c) or a default by the Underwriters pursuant to
	Section 8), the Sponsor will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket
	expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with the offering of the Notes.

COLLEGIATE FUNDING OF DELAWARE LLC - S-3/A - 20070212 - BUSINESS






	THE STUDENT LOAN FINANCING BUSINESS OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK





	JPMorgan Chase Bank and its affiliates are engaged in the student loan financing business.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, directly or through its affiliates, originates and services student loans insured under various federally sponsored programs for itself, as well as, to a lesser extent, for unaffiliated third parties.  


	Appendix AFederal Family Education Loan Program

	 to this prospectus describes these federally sponsored programs and is hereby incorporated into this prospectus.






	Loan Originations





	JPMorgan Chase Entities are currently eligible to make FFELP loans, all of which are insured by guarantors and reinsured by the Department of Education, including: the subsidized federal Stafford Loans, unsubsidized federal Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and federal consolidation loans.  Subsidized federal Stafford Loans are generally made to students who pass certain need criteria.  Unsubsidized federal Stafford Loans are not need based.  They are designed for students who do not qualify for subsidized federal Stafford Loans,


	who qualify for less than the maximum federal subsidized Stafford Loan,

	or whose need exceeds the basic subsidized Stafford Loan limit.  PLUS Loans are made to parents of students who are dependents and, since July 2006, to qualifying graduate and professional students.  The federal consolidation loan program allows multiple federal loans, including those of both FFELP and FDLP, to be combined into one single aggregate insured loan.  Consolidation loans may include government-guaranteed loans formerly held by other lenders.  Prior to consolidation, any loan balances that are not already owned by a JPMorgan Chase Entity are repaid, and the principal amount of the repaid loan is added to the consolidation loan.  A consolidation loan is allowed an extended repayment term of up to 30 years, depending on the student loan balance.


	The student loan volume of JPMorgan Chase Entities primarily results from their marketing efforts, repeat borrowers and third party referral/affinity arrangements.





	44








	A student must attend an eligible educational institution in order to participate in FFELP.  Eligible educational institutions can be divided into three categories: four-year colleges and universities, two-year institutions and proprietary (vocational) schools.  In addition to other criteria, school eligibility is determined by the default rate on guaranteed loans to its students.  Under the Higher Education Act, eligible lenders, subject to certain restrictions, may choose not to make loans to students attending certain schools, defined by school type, geographic location or default experience.






	Origination Process





	The Higher Education Act specifies rules regarding loan origination practices, which lenders must comply with in order for their loans to be guaranteed and to be eligible to receive federal interest subsidies or other federal assistance.  Lenders are prohibited from offering points, premiums, payments or other inducements, directly or indirectly, to any educational institution, guarantor or individual in order to obtain loan applicants, and no lender may conduct unsolicited mailings of student loan applications to students who have not previously received student loans from that lender, or to parents of such students.



	With respect to Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, the borrower completes a master promissory note and the school completes an associated loan certification.  Master promissory notes and school certifications are sent either to JPMorgan Chase Bank, another JPMorgan Chase Entity or to a processing agent acting on the lenders behalf, which may be a subservicer, guarantor, or other loan processing entity.  The student loan application process is either completed online through the website of the lender or of a processing agent acting on the lenders behalf, or through submission of a paper application to JPMorgan Chase Bank, another JPMorgan Chase Entity or a processing agent acting on the lenders behalf.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, the relevant JPMorgan Chase Entity or its agent reviews each master promissory note to confirm its completeness, that the applicant is an eligible student and that such student loan complies with certain other conditions of FFELP.  Both the guarantor (whether it is acting as a processing agent or not) and JPMorgan Chase Bank or the relevant JPMorgan Chase Entity must approve the student loan request.  Upon the guarantors approval, the guarantor sends a notice of guarantee to JPMorgan Chase Bank, the relevant JPMorgan Chase Entity or a processing agent acting on the lenders behalf (if different than the guarantor).  After receiving the notice of guarantee, JPMorgan Chase Bank or the relevant JPMorgan Chase Entity causes the proceeds of the student loan to be disbursed directly to the school and sends a disclosure statement to the borrower confirming the terms of the student loan.  JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities also originate student loans under blanket guarantee agreements with certain guarantors, under which JPMorgan Chase Bank or the relevant JPMorgan Chase Entity is eligible to secure and retain guarantees on certain loan originations without having to obtain guarantor approval on each individual loan prior to loan funding.


	For consolidation loans, the borrower completes a combined application/promissory note and sends it either to JPMorgan Chase Bank, another JPMorgan Chase Entity or its processing agent.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, such other JPMorgan Chase Entity or its processing agent obtains certifications from the lenders of the student loans to be consolidated.  After the application/promissory note and certifications are reviewed to confirm that the borrower is eligible for a consolidation loan, the student loan is approved and JPMorgan Chase Bank or such





	45








	other JPMorgan Chase Entity causes the proceeds of such consolidation loan to be disbursed to each lender of the student loans being consolidated in amounts sufficient to retire each of such student loans.  JPMorgan Chase Bank or such other JPMorgan Chase Entity also causes a disclosure to be sent to the borrower confirming the terms of the consolidation loan.  JPMorgan Chase Bank or other JPMorgan Chase Entities originate consolidation loans through comprehensive certificates of insurance with guarantors, under which JPMorgan Chase Bank or another JPMorgan Chase Entity is eligible to secure and retain guarantees on such student loans without having to obtain guarantor approval on each individual loan.






	Loan Purchase





	From time to time, JPMorgan Chase Bank or other JPMorgan Chase Entities may purchase FFELP loans on a spot basis from an unrelated entity that qualifies as an eligible lender under FFELP.  In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank may purchase student loans over a specified period of time pursuant to commitment contracts with other lenders.  In conjunction with commitment contracts, JPMorgan Chase Bank may provide the other lenders with operational support in the form of its student loan origination and interim servicing system.







	Servicing





	Once student loans are originated or acquired, they are serviced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, other JPMorgan Chase Entities or third party servicers.  All servicing by third party servicers is performed under contractual agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities.



	The Department of Education and the various guarantors prescribe rules and regulations which govern the servicing of federally insured student loans.  These rules and regulations include specific procedures for contacting delinquent borrowers, locating borrowers who can no longer be contacted at their documented address or telephone number, and filing claims for reimbursement on student loans in default.  Payments under a guarantors guarantee agreement require strict adherence to these stated due diligence and collection procedures.


	Regulations require that collection efforts commence within 15 days of any delinquency and continue for the period of delinquency until the student loan is deemed to be in default status.  During the delinquency period, the holder of the student loan must diligently attempt to contact the borrower, in writing and by telephone, at specified intervals.  Most FFELP loans are considered to be in default when they are more than 270 days delinquent.


	A guarantor may reject any claim for payment under a guarantee agreement if the specified due diligence and collection procedures required by that guarantee agreement have not been strictly followed and documented or if the claim is not timely filed.  Minor errors in due diligence may result in the imposition of interest penalties, rather than a complete loss of the guarantee.  In instances in which a claim for payment under a guarantee agreement is denied due to servicing or claim-filing errors, the guaranteed status of the affected student loans may be reinstated by following specified procedures, called curing the defect.  Interest penalties are commonly incurred on loans that are cured.





	46








	The internal procedures of JPMorgan Chase Bank, on its own behalf and on behalf of other JPMorgan Chase Entities, support compliance with existing Department of Education and guarantor regulations and reporting requirements, and provide high quality service to borrowers.  JPMorgan Chase Bank also requires its third party servicers to maintain operating procedures which comply with applicable Department of Education and guarantor regulations and reporting requirements, and periodically reviews certain operations for compliance.






	Consolidation/Repayment Programs





	Consolidation and repayment programs made available by JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities to student loan borrowers will continue to be made available to borrowers with trust student loans.  JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities currently participate in the consolidation loan program.  Therefore, the transfer and servicing agreements will permit the related seller to purchase student loans from the issuing entity to effect consolidations at the request of borrowers.  See 


	Appendix AFederal Family Education Loan ProgramConsolidation Loan Program

	 in this prospectus.


	In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities may offer some borrowers loan repayment terms that do not provide for level payments over the repayment term of the student loan.  For example, under a typical graduated repayment program, some student loans provide for an interest-only period.  During this interest-only period, the borrower is required to make payment of accrued interest only.  No payment of the principal of the student loan is required.  At the conclusion of the interest-only period, the student loan must be amortized through level payments over the remaining term.


	In other cases, JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities offer borrowers a graduated phased-in amortization of the principal of the student loans.  For these loans, a greater portion of the principal amortization of the student loan occurs in the later stages of the student loan than would be the case if amortization were on a level payment basis.


	JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities may also offer various income-sensitive repayment plans under which repayments are adjusted annually based on the borrowers income.  Under these plans, ultimate repayment may be delayed up to an additional five years due to the granting of forbearance.






	Incentive Programs





	JPMorgan Chase Bank and other JPMorgan Chase Entities have offered, and intend to continue to offer, various incentive programs to student loan borrowers.  Some of the programs that may apply to student loans owned by the issuing entities are:




	·




	Interest rate reductions after a borrower makes a given number of consecutive on-time payments.




	·




	Money back or a reduction in principal after a borrower makes a given number of consecutive on-time payments.






	47









	·




	Interest rate reductions for use of auto debit by a borrower to make his or her student loan payments.



	It is uncertain how many borrowers will participate in these programs.  These programs may be modified from time to time. More specific details, if any, with respect to incentive programs and borrower benefits applicable to the trust student loans will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.






	TRANSFER AND SERVICING AGREEMENTS





	The following is a summary of the material terms of the transfer agreements under which the issuing entities will acquire student loans from the depositor and the purchase agreements under which the depositor will acquire the trust student loans from the sellers specified in the related prospectus supplement.  Forms of the transfer agreement and purchase agreements have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.  The purchase agreements, the transfer agreement, the master servicing agreement, the subservicing agreements and the administration agreement for an issuing entity are sometimes referred to in this prospectus collectively as the 


	transfer and servicing agreements

	.  This summary does not cover every detail of these agreements, and it is subject to all of the provisions of the transfer and servicing agreements.  






	Purchase of Student Loans by the Depositor; Representations and Warranties of the Sellers





	On the closing date, each seller will sell to the depositor, without recourse, its entire interest in the trust student loans and all collections received after the cutoff date specified in the related prospectus supplement.  Each trust student loan purchased under each such purchase agreement will be identified in an exhibit to the relevant purchase agreement.



	In each purchase agreement, each seller will make representations and warranties concerning the trust student loans being sold by it.  These include, among other things, that:



	·




	each trust student loan is in full force and effect and free and clear of all security interests and other encumbrances and no offsets, defenses or counterclaims have been asserted or threatened by the respective obligor;




	·




	the information provided by the seller about the trust student loans is true and correct as of the cutoff date;




	·




	each trust student loan complies in all material respects with applicable federal and state laws and applicable restrictions imposed by FFELP or under any guarantee agreement; and




	·




	each trust student loan is guaranteed by the applicable guarantor.



	Upon notice of a breach of any representation or warranty made by a seller that has a material adverse effect on the depositor or the issuing entity, such seller will reacquire the affected trust student loan unless the breach is cured within the applicable cure period specified in the related prospectus supplement. However, any breach that relates to compliance with the





	48








	Higher Education Act or the requirements of the applicable guarantor that does not affect that guarantors obligation to guarantee payment of a trust student loan will not be considered to have a material adverse effect.  Alternatively, rather than reacquiring the trust student loan, the affected seller may substitute Qualified Substitute Student Loans for that loan. In addition, the affected seller will have an obligation to reimburse the depositor:



	·




	for any shortfall between:




	·




	the Purchase Amount of the Qualified Substitute Student Loans, and




	·




	the Purchase Amount of the trust student loan being replaced thereby; plus




	·




	for any accrued interest amounts not guaranteed by, or that are required to be refunded to, a guarantor and any interest subsidy payments or special allowance payments lost as a result of the breach.



	Any required reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement will occur on the last day of the next collection period ending after the applicable cure period has expired.


	The reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations of each seller constitute the sole remedy available to the depositor for any uncured breach.  The reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations of each seller are contractual obligations that the depositor or issuing entity may enforce against the relevant seller but the breach of these obligations will not constitute an event of default under the indenture.  In cases where the obligations which the depositor or the issuing entity is seeking to enforce are based on a violation of the Higher Education Act, a final and binding determination by the Department of Education that the Higher Education Act has been violated or that a student loan is no longer insured because of a violation of the Higher Education Act may be required prior to the depositor or the issuing entitys being able to enforce the reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations of such seller.






	Transfer of Student Loans to the Issuing Entity; Representations and Warranties of the Depositor





	On the closing date, the depositor will contribute or sell to the eligible lender trustee, on behalf of the issuing entity, without recourse, its entire interest in the trust student loans acquired by the depositor from the sellers.  Each trust student loan acquired by the issuing entity will be identified in an exhibit to the relevant transfer agreement.  Concurrently with that contribution or sale, the issuing entity will issue the notes and the certificates, if any.  The issuing entity will transfer the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the certificates, if any, to the depositor.



	In each transfer agreement, the depositor will make representations and warranties concerning the trust student loans to the related issuing entity that are substantially the same as those made by each seller to the depositor.


	Upon notice of a breach of any representation or warranty made by the depositor that has a material adverse effect on the issuing entity, the depositor will have reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations that are substantially the same as those of the sellers.





	49








	The reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations of the depositor will constitute the sole remedy available to the securityholders for any uncured breach.  The depositors reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations are contractual obligations that the issuing entity may enforce against the depositor, but the breach of these obligations will not constitute an event of default under the indenture.  In cases where the obligations which the issuing entity is seeking to enforce are based on a violation of the Higher Education Act, a final and binding determination by the Department of Education that the Higher Education Act has been violated or that a loan is no longer insured because of a violation of the Higher Education Act may be required prior to the issuing entitys being able to enforce the reacquisition or substitution and reimbursement obligations of the depositor.






	Additional Fundings






	Prefunding.


	 The related prospectus supplement will indicate whether a prefunding account will exist for a particular issuing entity.  The related prospectus supplement will also indicate:



	·




	the amount in the prefunding account on the closing date, which will not exceed 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of securities; provided, however, that to the extent that a supplemental purchase account, prefunding account and/or consolidation loan add-on account have been established with respect to a series of securities, the aggregate amounts on deposit in such accounts will not be greater than 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of securities,




	·




	the length of the prefunding period, which will not extend for more than one year from the date of issuance of the related series of securities, and




	·




	the uses to which the funds in the prefunding account may be applied and the conditions to the application of those funds.



	If the prefunding amount has not been fully applied to purchase additional student loans by the last day of the prefunding period, the securityholders will receive any remaining amounts.


	The requisite underwriting criteria related to the additional student loans in the prefunding period are in all cases prescribed by the provisions of the Higher Education Act.  Information with respect to the additional student loans eligible to be acquired by the related issuing entity in the prefunding period, including any differences from the criteria used to select the trust student loans acquired on the closing date, will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.



	Supplemental Purchase Period.

	 The related prospectus supplement will indicate whether a supplemental purchase account will exist for a particular issuing entity.


	The related prospectus supplement will also indicate:



	·




	the amount in the supplemental purchase account on the closing date, which will not exceed 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of






	50








	securities; provided, however, that to the extent that a supplemental purchase account, prefunding account and/or consolidation loan add-on account have been established with respect to a series of securities, the aggregate amounts on deposit in such accounts will not be greater than 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of securities,  



	·




	the length of the supplemental purchase period, and




	·




	the uses to which the funds in the supplemental purchase account may be applied and the conditions to the application of those funds.



	During the supplemental purchase period, the issuing entity will use amounts on deposit in the supplemental purchase account to purchase additional student loans so that the total amount of trust student loans, after giving effect to the additional student loans purchased during the supplemental purchase period, will be approximately equal to the amount of trust student loans on the statistical cutoff date.


	The requisite underwriting criteria related to the additional student loans in the supplemental purchase period are in all cases prescribed by the provisions of the Higher Education Act.  Information with respect to the additional student loans eligible to be acquired by the related issuing entity in the supplemental purchase period, including any differences from the criteria used to select the trust student loans acquired on the closing date, will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.



	Revolving Period.  

	The related prospectus supplement will indicate whether there is a revolving period for a particular issuing entity to acquire additional student loans with the cash flows from the related pool of trust student loans.  The related prospectus supplement will also indicate:



	·




	the length of the revolving period, which will not extend for more than three years from the date of issuance of the related series,




	·




	the maximum amount of additional assets that may be acquired during the revolving period,




	·




	the percentage of the asset pool represented by the amount of additional assets acquired during the revolving period, and




	·




	the use to which such cash flows may be applied and the conditions to the application of those cash flows.



	The requisite underwriting criteria related to the additional student loans in the revolving period are in all cases prescribed by the provisions of the Higher Education Act.  Information with respect to the additional student loans eligible to be acquired by the related issuing entity in the revolving period, including any differences from the criteria used to select the trust student loans acquired on the closing date, will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.





	51









	Consolidation Loan Add-on Period.

	 With respect to issuing entities where the trust student loans contain consolidation loans, the related prospectus supplement will indicate whether a consolidation loan add-on account will exist for that particular issuing entity.  The related prospectus supplement will also indicate:



	·




	the amount in the consolidation loan add-on account on the closing date, which will not exceed 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of securities; provided, however, that to the extent that a supplemental purchase account, prefunding account and/or consolidation loan add-on account have been established with respect to a series of securities, the aggregate amounts on deposit in such accounts will not be greater than 50% of the net proceeds of the offering of the related series of securities,




	·




	the length of the prefunding period (not to exceed the lesser of (A) the maximum number of days from the closing date during which borrowers may add additional student loans to an existing consolidation loan pursuant to the terms of the Higher Education Act, or (B) the maximum permitted prefunding period), and




	·




	the uses to which the funds in the consolidation loan add-on account may be applied and the conditions to the application of those funds.







	Custodian of Promissory Notes





	To ensure uniform quality in servicing and to reduce administrative costs, the master servicer will act, directly or through the subservicers or third party sub-custodians on behalf of the master servicer for the benefit of the issuing entity and the indenture trustee, as custodian of the promissory notes, in physical or electronic form, through its own, the subservicers or the third party sub-custodians facilities, representing the trust student loans, and in the case of a subservicer, the student loans that it is servicing, and any other related documents; provided, however, that in the case of electronically signed promissory notes, a custodian may not be utilized if custody is not necessary for perfection of a security interest in the notes under the UCC.



	The records of the depositor, the master servicer and the subservicers will reflect the sale and transfer by the sellers of the trust student loans to the depositor and their subsequent assignment by the depositor to the issuing entity.  UCC financing statements reflecting the assignments will be filed.  The depositor or the master servicer (or the related subservicer on its behalf) will be responsible for maintaining such perfected security interest through the filing of continuation statements or amended financing statements, as applicable.






	Amendments to Transfer and Servicing Agreements





	Except as otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement, the parties to the transfer and servicing agreements (other than the subservicing agreements) may amend them without the consent of the noteholders or the certificateholders, but with prior written notice to the rating agencies, for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correcting or supplementing any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision in any such agreement (other






	52








	than a subservicing agreement), this prospectus, the related prospectus supplement and/or any other Transaction Document, (ii) complying with applicable law or regulation, or (iii) adding any other provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions in any such agreement (other than a subservicing agreement) or modifying in any manner the rights of the noteholders or the certificateholders other than any amendment described in the second paragraph of this section; provided, however, that no such amendment described in any of clauses (i) through (iii) above may materially adversely affect the interests of the noteholders or the certificateholders.  An amendment will be deemed not to materially adversely affect the interests of any noteholder or any certificateholder if the party requesting the amendment obtains and delivers to the other parties to such agreement an opinion of counsel to that effect.


	Except as otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement, any of the transfer and servicing agreements may also be amended from time to time by the parties thereto, with the consent of noteholders of at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Controlling Class and with prior written notice to the rating agencies, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of such agreement (other than a subservicing agreement) or modifying in any manner the rights of the noteholders or the certificateholders.  However, no such amendment shall:



	·




	increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, or change the allocation or priority of, collections of payments on or in respect of the trust student loans or distributions which are required to be made for the benefit of the noteholders or the certificateholders, or change the rate of interest of any note; or




	·




	reduce the percentage of the aggregate outstanding amount of any class of notes or certificates, the consent of the holders of which is required for any amendments to such agreement;



	without the consent of the holder of each note or certificate affected by that change.


	Any amendment to the transfer and servicing agreements (other than the subservicing agreements) to amend, supplement or modify the permitted activities of the issuing entity would require the consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the notes and a majority of the outstanding certificates.


	Except as otherwise provided in the related prospectus supplement, the parties to any subservicing agreements may amend such provisions without notice to or consent of the securityholders, rating agencies, indenture trustee, the eligible lender trustee or the owner trustee.








	Non-Petition and True Sale





	Each transfer and servicing agreement will also contain non-petition covenants to prevent the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against the depositor and/or the issuing entity, as applicable, by any of the transaction parties or by the securityholders.






	53








	The transactions described in this prospectus have been structured to ensure that the transfer of the trust student loans by the sellers to the depositor constitutes a true sale of the trust student loans.  If the transfer constitutes a true sale, the trust student loans and related proceeds would not be property of the applicable seller should such seller become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency law.  Although each seller and the depositor will express its intent to treat the conveyance of the related trust student loans as a sale, each seller and the depositor will also grant to the eligible lender trustee, on behalf of the issuing entity, a security interest in the related trust student loans.  This security interest is intended to protect the interests of the securityholders if a bankruptcy court or the FDIC (as conservator or receiver for JPMorgan Chase Bank), as applicable, were to characterize a sellers or the depositors transfer of the trust student loans as a borrowing by such seller or the depositor secured by a pledge of the trust student loans.  In the event that a bankruptcy court or the FDIC were to characterize the transaction as a borrowing by a seller or the depositor, that borrowing would be secured by the trust student loans in which such seller or the depositor granted a security interest to the eligible lender trustee.  Each seller and the depositor has agreed to take those actions that are necessary to maintain the security interest granted to the eligible lender trustee, as a first priority perfected security interest in the trust student loans, including the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, if necessary.


	The depositor will also represent and warrant that each contribution or sale of trust student loans by the depositor to the issuing entity is a valid assignment of an ownership interest in those loans.  In addition, the depositor, the eligible lender trustee and the issuing entity will treat the conveyance of the trust student loans as an assignment of an ownership interest.  The depositor and each seller will be required to take all actions that are required so the eligible lender trustee will be treated as the legal owner of the related trust student loans.






	SERVICING AND ADMINISTRATION





	The following is a summary of the material terms of (a) the master servicing agreement, under which the master servicer will be responsible for causing the subservicers to service the trust student loans and (b) the administration agreement, under which the administrator will undertake administrative duties for an issuing entity and its trust student loans.  Forms of the master servicing agreement and the administration agreement have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.  In the event any subservicer is responsible for servicing 10% or more of the trust student loans, the material terms of the subservicing agreement will be described in the related prospectus supplement.  The master servicing agreement and the subservicing agreements are sometimes referred to in this prospectus as 


	servicing agreements

	.  This summary does not cover every detail of the master servicing agreement or administration agreement, and it is subject to all provisions of the master servicing agreement and the administration agreement.






	Trust Accounts





	For each issuing entity, the administrator will establish one or more collection accounts in the name of the indenture trustee into which all payments on the related trust student loans will be deposited.  As specified in the related prospectus supplement, trust accounts established for an issuing entity may include a collection account, any reserve account, any prefunding account,






	54








	any capitalized interest account, any cash capitalization account, any cash collateral account, any supplemental purchase account, any supplemental interest account, any investment reserve account, any currency account, any remarketing fee account, any accumulation account, any investment premium purchase account and/or any consolidation loan add-on account.


	For any series of securities, the administrator will invest funds in the trust accounts in Eligible Investments as provided in the indenture.


	Each trust account will be either:



	·




	a segregated deposit account maintained with an Eligible Institution meeting the requirements of clause (i) of the definition of Eligible Institution; or




	·




	a segregated trust account maintained with a trust department of an Eligible Institution meeting the requirements of clause (ii) of the definition of Eligible Institution.



	Each issuing entity may invest sums on deposit in trust accounts in Eligible Investments.  The Eligible Investments will mature on the dates specified in the related prospectus supplement.


	Unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement, there is no independent verification of the administrators reports concerning the trust accounts or the transaction activity therein.






	Servicing Procedures





	Under each master servicing agreement, the master servicer will agree to service (or to cause the subservicers to service) all of the trust student loans.  Each of the master servicer and the subservicers is required to perform all services and duties customary to the servicing of student loans, including all collection practices.  Each master servicer and subservicer must use the same standard of care as used to service similar student loans owned by JPMorgan Chase Bank, and in compliance with the Higher Education Act, the guarantee agreements and all other applicable federal and state laws.  The master servicer has entered into certain subservicing agreements with the subservicers in respect of the servicing of its student loans.  However, the master servicer may designate additional subservicers to perform some or all of the duties listed below under certain subservicing agreements; provided that the master servicer will not be relieved of its responsibilities and obligations under the master servicing agreement.  



	The duties of the master servicer (any or all of which have been delegated or may be delegated by the master servicer to the subservicers) include the following:



	·




	collecting and remitting to the administrator or, if specified in the related prospectus supplement, depositing into the collection account, all payments on the trust student loans, including claiming and obtaining any Program Payments;




	·




	responding to inquiries from borrowers;




	·




	attempting to collect delinquent payments; and






	55









	·




	sending out statements and payment coupons to borrowers.



	In addition, the master servicer will (or will cause each subservicer to) keep ongoing records on the trust student loans and its collection activities, and furnish periodic statements to the indenture trustee, the owner trustee and the securityholders, in accordance with the customary practices of the master servicer or the relevant subservicer, as applicable, and as specifically required in the master servicing agreement.  In addition, each subservicer will be required to maintain its eligibility as a third-party servicer under the Higher Education Act.  A subservicer may be required to purchase trust student loans from the issuing entity if it fails to comply with the terms and provisions of the subservicing agreement.  






	Payments on Student Loans





	The master servicer and the subservicers are required to deposit all payments on the trust student loans collected during each collection period into the related collection account within two business days of receipt of the payments, or if the payment is not readily identifiable as a payment on trust student loan, within two business days of being so identified.  





	However, if specified in the related prospectus supplement and for so long as no administrator default has occurred and is continuing, and any other condition to making deposits less frequently than daily as may be specified by the rating agencies or set forth in the related prospectus supplement is satisfied, the master servicer and each subservicer will remit these amounts to the administrator within two business days of receipt, and the administrator will be required to deposit these amounts in the collection account by the business day preceding each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement.  


	Pending deposit into the collection account by the administrator, collections may be invested by the administrator at its own risk and for its own benefit and will not be segregated from its own funds.  To the extent set forth in the related prospectus supplement, the administrator may, in order to satisfy the requirements described above, obtain a letter of credit or other security for the benefit of the related issuing entity to secure timely remittances of collections on the trust student loans.


	No servicing agreement will require the master servicer or any subservicer to make advances to any issuing entity and no such advances have been made by the master servicer or any subservicer with respect to any trust student loans.






	Payment of Notes





	Upon the payment in full of all outstanding notes of a given series, the owner trustee will succeed to all of the rights of the indenture trustee, and the certificateholders will succeed to all of the rights of the noteholders under the related transfer agreement.







	Termination





	For each issuing entity, the obligations of the master servicer, the depositor, the administrator, the eligible lender trustee, the owner trustee and the indenture trustee under the transfer and servicing agreements will terminate upon:






	56









	·




	the maturity or liquidation of the last trust student loan and the disposition of any amount received upon the maturity or liquidation of the last trust student loan;




	·




	the payment to the securityholders of all amounts required to be paid to them; and




	·




	the payment of other amounts required to be paid to other persons, as specified in the related prospectus supplement.



	The master servicer or another entity specified in the related prospectus supplement, at its option, may repurchase or arrange for the purchase of all remaining trust student loans on any Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement when the pool balance reduces to a percentage as specified in the related prospectus supplement or less of the sum of the initial pool balance, plus the aggregate initial principal balances of all trust student loans acquired during any applicable prefunding period, plus accrued interest to be capitalized as of the applicable cutoff dates plus any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.  The purchase price will equal the aggregate Purchase Amounts for the trust student loans as of the last day of the related collection period.  It will not be less than the minimum Purchase Amount specified in the related prospectus supplement.  These amounts will be used to retire the related notes and certificates, if any.  Upon termination of an issuing entity, any remaining assets of that issuing entity, after giving effect to final distributions to the securityholders, will be transferred to the reserve account and paid as provided in the related prospectus supplement.


	If specified in the related prospectus supplement, the indenture trustee will try to auction any trust student loans remaining in the issuing entity at the last day of the collection period preceding the applicable trust auction dates specified in the related prospectus supplement.  None of JPMorgan Chase Bank or its affiliates will make bids to purchase these trust student loans on any trust auction date.  The minimum purchase price for the issuing entitys assets and any other conditions to sale will be specified in the related prospectus supplement.






	Master Servicer Covenants





	For each issuing entity, the master servicer will agree that:




	·




	it will (or will cause each subservicer to) satisfy all of its obligations relating to the trust student loans, maintain in effect all qualifications required in order to service the trust student loans and comply in all material respects with all requirements of law if a failure to comply would have a material adverse effect on the interest of the issuing entity;




	·




	it will not permit (nor will it allow any subservicer to permit) any rescission or cancellation of a trust student loan except as ordered by a court or other governmental authority or as consented to by the eligible lender trustee and the indenture trustee, except that it may write off any delinquent loan if the remaining balance of the borrower’s account is less than $50; and




	·




	it will not (nor will it permit any subservicer to) reschedule, revise, defer or otherwise compromise payments due on any trust student loan except during any






	57








	applicable interest-only, deferment or forbearance periods or otherwise in accordance with the same standards it uses for similar student loans owned by the master servicer and its affiliates in compliance with the applicable guarantee agreements and all other applicable federal and state laws, including, if applicable, the Higher Education Act.


	Upon notice of a breach of any covenant made by the master servicer that has a material adverse effect on the interest of the related issuing entity, the master servicer will purchase that trust student loan unless the breach is cured within the applicable cure period specified on the related prospectus supplement.  However, any breach that relates to compliance with the Higher Education Act or the requirements of the applicable guarantor that does not affect that guarantors obligation to guarantee payment of a trust student loan will not be considered to have a material adverse effect.  The related issuing entitys interest in that purchased trust student loan will be assigned to the master servicer or its designee.


	Any required purchase and reimbursement will occur on the last day of the next collection period ending after the applicable cure period has expired.


	The purchase and reimbursement obligations of the master servicer will constitute the sole remedy available to the issuing entity for any uncured breach.  The master servicers purchase and reimbursement obligations are contractual obligations that the issuing entity may enforce, but the breach of these obligations will not constitute an event of default under the indenture.  In cases where the obligations which the issuing entity is seeking to enforce are based on a violation of the Higher Education Act, a final and binding determination by the Department of Education that the Higher Education Act has been violated or that a student loan is no longer insured because of a violation of the Higher Education Act may be required prior to the issuing entitys being able to enforce the purchase and reimbursement obligations of the master servicer.






	Servicing Compensation





	For each issuing entity, the master servicer will receive a master servicing fee for each period in an amount specified in the related prospectus supplement.  The master servicer will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities set forth under the master servicing agreement, including fees and disbursements of independent accountants, taxes imposed on the master servicer and expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports to the administrator, but excluding expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation of a trust student loan, provided, however, that the master servicer may, at its option, and to the extent permissible under the Higher Education Act and other applicable law, collect certain fees from the borrowers such as fees in connection with sending payment histories and amortization schedules to borrowers, faxing documents to borrowers, providing credit reference letters to borrowers, providing a speed pay payment option to borrowers and for other similar optional services requested by a borrower and may retain such fees.  The master servicer may also, at its option (or at the direction of the master servicer, the applicable subservicer may), collect fees from borrowers for returned check processing or other insufficient fund transactions and may assess such fees from the borrower’s trust student loan payment and retain such fees.



	The master servicing fee may consist of either one or any combination of:





	58









	·




	a specified annual percentage of the pool balance; or




	·




	a unit amount based on the number of accounts or borrowers and other activity- or event-related fees; or




	·




	any other formulation described in the related prospectus supplement.



	The master servicing fee may also include specified amounts payable to the master servicer for tasks it performs.  The master servicing fee may be subject to a maximum monthly amount.  If that is the case, the related prospectus supplement will state the maximum together with any conditions to its application.  The master servicing fee, including any unpaid amounts from prior Distribution Dates, will have a payment priority over the securities, to the extent specified in the related prospectus supplement.  The related prospectus supplement will specify whether the monthly fees of the subservicers will be paid solely by the master servicer under the terms of the applicable subservicing agreements or whether these fees will be paid from the assets of the issuing entity.


	The master servicing fee compensates the master servicer for performing (or causing the subservicers to perform) the functions of a third party servicer of student loans.






	Net Deposits





	As an administrative convenience and if specified in the related prospectus supplement, unless the master servicer and the subservicers must remit collections daily to the collection account, the administrator may deposit collections for any collection period net of servicing and administration fees for the same period into the collection account.  The administrator may make a single, net transfer to the collection account on the business day preceding each applicable Distribution Date.  The administrator, however, will account to the indenture trustee, the owner trustee, the noteholders and the certificateholders as if all deposits, distributions and transfers were made separately.







	Certain Matters Regarding The Master Servicer





	The master servicing agreement will provide that the master servicer is an independent contractor and that, except for the services to be performed under the master servicing agreement, it will not hold itself out as an agent of the issuing entities.



	The master servicer may not resign, except:



	·




	upon a determination that the performance of the master servicer’s duties is no longer permissible under applicable law; or  




	·




	if a successor master servicer is appointed, the rating agencies confirm that this will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings then applicable to the notes and certificates.  



	The master servicers resignation will not become effective until the related indenture trustee or a successor master servicer has assumed the master servicing responsibilities and





	59








	obligations.  The indenture trustee will not be obligated to act as the successor master servicer unless the master servicer resigns because the performance of its duties as servicer is no longer permissible under applicable law.


	The master servicer may not transfer or assign all, or a portion of, its rights, obligations and duties as master servicer, except in connection with a merger or consolidation or sale of servicing operations of JPMorgan Chase Bank, unless:



	·




	the rating agencies confirm that this will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings then applicable to the notes and certificates; or  




	·




	consent is obtained from holders of securities evidencing a majority of the voting interests (or the Controlling Class).  



	The master servicer cannot effect a transfer or assignment of all of its rights, obligations and duties as master servicer until a successor servicer has assumed those rights, obligations and duties.


	The master servicer may, in the ordinary course of its business, delegate any of its duties as master servicer to a third party.  The master servicer will be obligated to pay the compensation payable to that third party from its own funds.  No other entity will be liable for that third partys compensation. Any delegation of duties by the master servicer will not relieve the master servicer of liability and responsibility for the performance of those duties.


	See 

	Rights upon Master Servicer Default

	 in this prospectus for more information regarding removal and replacement of the master servicer.


	Each master servicing agreement will further provide that neither the master servicer nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents will have any liability to the issuing entity or to the securityholders for taking or not taking any action under the related master servicing agreement, or for errors in judgment.  However, the master servicer will not be protected against:



	·




	its obligation to purchase trust student loans from an issuing entity as required in the related master servicing agreement or to pay to the issuing entity the amount of any Program Payment which a guarantor or the Department of Education refuses to pay, or requires the issuing entity to refund, as a result of the master servicer’s breach, or




	·




	any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of the master servicers duties or because of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties.



	In addition, each master servicing agreement will provide that the master servicer is under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action where it is not named as a party.





	60












	Master Servicer Default





	A master servicer default under each master servicing agreement will consist of:




	·




	the master servicer’s failure to deliver to the administrator:  




	·




	the monthly report for any collection period, or  




	·




	for deposit in the collection account or other trust account, any amounts required to be deposited in those accounts under the terms of the securities issued by the related issuing entity or the related Transaction Documents,  



	which failure continues unremedied for five business days after notice; and



	·




	the master servicer’s failure to duly observe or perform in any material respect any other term, covenant or agreement in the related Transaction Documents which failure materially and adversely affects the rights of the related issuing entity or the securityholders, which determination will be made without regard to whether funds are available to the securityholders pursuant to any related enhancement, and continues unremedied for 60 days after notice of the failure; and




	·




	the occurrence of certain Insolvency Events specified in the Transaction Documents in respect of the master servicer; and




	·




	any failure by the master servicer to comply with any requirements under the Higher Education Act resulting in a loss of its eligibility as a third party servicer (or the failure of the master servicer to replace promptly any subservicer that has lost its eligibility as a third party servicer).



	For purposes of a master servicer default, notice means



	·




	written notice to the master servicer by the indenture trustee; or




	·




	written notice to the master servicer and the indenture trustee by holders of at least 25% of the notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) or certificates (or subordinate notes, if applicable).



	A master servicer default does not include any failure of the master servicer to service a student loan in accordance with the Higher Education Act so long as the master servicer is in compliance with its obligations under the master servicing agreement to purchase the related trust student loan and reimburse for any shortfall in the value of the related trust student loan.






	Rights upon Master Servicer Default





	As long as a master servicer default has not been remedied, the indenture trustee or holders of a majority of the outstanding notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the master servicer.  Only the indenture trustee or






	61








	the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) and not the owner trustee or the certificateholders (or the subordinate noteholders, if applicable) will have the ability to remove the master servicer if a master servicer default occurs while the notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) are outstanding.  Following a termination, a successor master servicer appointed by the indenture trustee or the indenture trustee itself will assume all of the obligations and succeed to all of the rights of the master servicer under the master servicing agreement and will be entitled to similar compensation arrangements.  The compensation may not be greater than the servicing compensation to the predecessor master servicer under that master servicing agreement, unless the compensation arrangements will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the then-current ratings of the notes and certificates.  The successor master servicer will assume all of the obligations and succeed to all of the rights of the predecessor master servicer under each related subservicing agreement and, if there has been a breach of any such subservicing agreement that entitles the master servicer to terminate such subservicing agreement, the master servicer may terminate such subservicing agreement and enter into one or more new subservicing agreements with one or more new or existing subservicers.  All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with transferring the trust student loan files to the successor master servicer and amending the master servicing agreement and any other Transaction Documents to reflect such succession as master servicer will be paid by the predecessor master servicer upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses.  If the indenture trustee is unwilling or unable to act as successor master servicer, it may appoint, or petition a court for the appointment of, a successor whose regular business includes the servicing of student loans.  






	Waiver of Past Defaults





	For each issuing entity, the holders of a majority of the outstanding notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) or a majority of the outstanding certificates (or subordinate notes, if applicable) in the case of any master servicer default which does not adversely affect the indenture trustee or the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) may, on behalf of all noteholders and certificateholders, waive any default by the master servicer, except a default in making any required deposits to or payments from any of the trust accounts or a default in making any required remittance to the administrator, as applicable, which defaults may be waived in writing by all noteholders.  Therefore, the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) have the ability, except as noted, to waive defaults by the master servicer which could materially and adversely affect the certificateholders (or the subordinate noteholders, if applicable).  No waiver will impair the noteholders or certificateholders rights as to subsequent defaults.







	Administration Agreement





	JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrator, will enter into an administration agreement with each issuing entity, the depositor, the eligible lender trustee, the master servicer, the owner trustee and the indenture trustee.  Under the administration agreement, the administrator will agree to provide various notices and to perform other administrative obligations required by the indenture, trust agreement and transfer agreement.  These services include:






	62









	·




	if applicable and specified in the related prospectus supplement, depositing payments on the trust student loans received from the master servicer or the subservicers into the collection account by the business day preceding each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement;




	·




	directing the paying agent to make the required distributions to the securityholders on each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement;




	·




	preparing, based on periodic data received from the master servicer and/or the subservicers, and providing quarterly distribution statements to the owner trustee and the indenture trustee; and




	·




	providing the notices and performing other administrative obligations required by the indenture, the trust agreement and the transfer agreement.



	As compensation, the administrator will receive an administration fee as specified in the related prospectus supplement.


	The administrator may not resign, except:



	·




	upon a determination that the performance of the administrator’s duties is no longer permissible under applicable law; or  




	·




	if a successor administrator is appointed, the rating agencies confirm that this will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings then applicable to the notes and certificates.  



	The administrator’s resignation will not become effective until the related indenture trustee or a successor administrator has assumed the administrators responsibilities and obligations under the administration agreement.  The indenture trustee will not be obligated to act as the successor administrator unless the administrator resigns because the performance of the administrators duties is no longer permissible under applicable law.


	The administrator may not transfer or assign all, or a portion of, its rights, obligations and duties as administrator, except in connection with a merger or consolidation or sale of certain business operations of JPMorgan Chase Bank, unless:



	·




	the rating agencies confirm that this will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings then applicable to the notes and certificates; or  




	·




	consent is obtained from holders of securities evidencing a majority of the voting interests (or the Controlling Class).  



	The administrator cannot effect a transfer or assignment of all of its rights, obligations and duties as administrator until a successor administrator has assumed those rights, obligations and duties.





	63








	All expenses related to the resignation and removal for cause of the administrator will be paid solely by the administrator being replaced.






	Administrator Default





	An administrator default under the administration agreement will consist of:




	·




	any failure by the administrator to deliver or deposit any required payment or amount as described in such administration agreement, if the failure continues unremedied for five business days after notice or discovery;




	·




	any failure by the administrator to direct the paying agent to make any required distributions from any of the trust accounts on any Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement, if the failure continues unremedied for five business days after notice or discovery;




	·




	any failure by the administrator to observe or perform in any material respect any other term, covenant or agreement in such administration agreement or a related agreement that materially and adversely affects the rights of noteholders or certificateholders and continues unremedied for 60 days after notice of the failure; and




	·




	the occurrence of certain Insolvency Events specified in the Transaction Documents in respect of the administrator.



	For purposes of an administrator default, notice means



	·




	written notice to the administrator by the indenture trustee or the owner trustee; or




	·




	written notice to the administrator and the indenture trustee by holders of at least 25% of the notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable), or, certificates (or subordinate notes, if applicable).







	Rights upon Administrator Default





	As long as any administrator default has not been remedied, the indenture trustee or holders of a majority of the outstanding notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the administrator.  Only the indenture trustee or the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) and not the owner trustee or the certificateholders (or the subordinate noteholders, if applicable) may remove the administrator if an administrator default occurs while the notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) are outstanding.  Following the termination of the administrator, a successor administrator appointed by the indenture trustee or the indenture trustee itself will assume all of the obligations and succeed to all of the rights of the predecessor administrator under the administration agreement.  All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with amending the administration agreement to reflect such succession as administrator will be paid by the predecessor administrator upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses.  The successor administrator will be entitled to an






	64








	amount agreed by such successor administrator (which will not exceed the administration fee of the predecessor administrator unless such compensation arrangements will not result in a downgrade or withdrawal of any existing rating on the securities by the rating agencies).  If the indenture trustee is unwilling or unable to act as successor administrator, it may appoint, or petition a court for the appointment of, a successor administrator whose regular business includes the servicing or administration of student loans.






	Waiver of Past Defaults





	For each issuing entity, the holders of a majority of the outstanding notes (or the Controlling Class, if applicable) or a majority of the outstanding certificates (or subordinate notes, if applicable) in the case of any administrator default which does not adversely affect the indenture trustee or the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) may, on behalf of all noteholders and certificateholders, waive any default by the administrator, except a default in making any required deposits to or payments from any of the trust accounts, which default may be waived in writing by all noteholders.  Therefore, the noteholders (or the holders of the Controlling Class, if applicable) have the ability, except as noted, to waive defaults by the administrator which could materially and adversely affect the certificateholders (or the subordinate noteholders, if applicable).  No waiver will impair the noteholders or certificateholders rights as to subsequent defaults.







	Statements to Indenture Trustee, Paying Agent and Owner Trustee





	Before each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement, the administrator will prepare and provide a statement to the indenture trustee, the paying agent and the owner trustee as of the last day of the preceding collection period.  The statement will include:




	·




	the amount of principal distributions allocable to each class of the notes;




	·




	the amount of interest distribution allocable to each class of the notes and the applicable interest rate for each class of the notes;




	·




	the pool balance as of the close of business on the first day and the last day of the related collection period;




	·




	the outstanding principal amount and the Note Pool Factor for each class of the notes and the certificate balance and the Certificate Pool Factor for each class of the certificates (after giving effect to payments allocated to principal) for that Distribution Date;




	·




	the amount of the primary servicing fee and/or any carryover servicing fee paid to the master servicer on the related Distribution Date(s) and the administration fee paid to the administrator on the related Distribution Date(s);




	·




	the amount of any aggregate realized losses for that collection period;






	65









	·




	the amount of any principal or interest shortfall, if applicable, for each class of notes and certificates, and any changes in these amounts from the preceding statement;




	·




	the amount of any note and certificate interest carryover for each class of securities, and any changes in these amounts from the preceding statement;




	·




	the aggregate Purchase Amounts for any trust student loans reacquired by the depositor, repurchased by a seller or purchased by the master servicer from the issuing entity in that collection period;




	·




	the balance of trust student loans that are delinquent in each delinquency period as of the last day of that collection period;




	·




	the balance of all trust accounts, after giving effect to changes in the balance on that Distribution Date;




	·




	any amounts paid to any credit enhancement provider or derivative counterparty, if applicable;




	·




	any amount of available credit enhancement drawn upon with respect to that Distribution Date, if applicable;




	·




	any material modifications, extensions or waivers to the terms of the trust student loans, fees, penalties or payments during the related collection period or that cumulatively become material over time;




	·




	any material breaches of representations and warranties regarding the trust student loans or if any applicable triggers or asset tests are then in effect;




	·




	if applicable, the amount of trust student loans added during any prefunding period (including any add-on consolidation loans or revolving period), and the amount of any required purchases, repurchases, reacquistions or substitutions of trust student loans, to the extent material; and




	·




	amounts distributed to the holders of the certificates and the uses of available funds to the extent not otherwise set forth above.



	The administrator may make available on each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement, to any interested party, the periodic statement to securityholders via the administrators website.  The administrators website will be located at www.[               ].  Parties that are unable to use the above distribution option are entitled to have a paper copy mailed to them via first class mail by notifying the administrator at the following address: [         ], Attention: [         ].  The administrator will have the right to change the way such reports are distributed in order to make such distributions more convenient and/or such reports more accessible, and the administrator will provide timely and adequate notification to such parties regarding any such changes.





	66












	Evidence as to Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria and Attestation





	The transfer and servicing agreements provide that on or before a specified date in each year, each party participating in the servicing function of the issuing entity provide a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 of Regulation AB.  Together with the assessment of compliance, a firm of independent public accountants will be required to furnish an attestation report compliant with Item 1122 of Regulation AB on the partys assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as an exhibit.





	The administration agreement also provides for the delivery by the administrator to the indenture trustee and the depositor, on or before a specified date in each year, of an annual officers certificate of the administrator to the effect that the administrator has fulfilled its obligations under the administration agreement throughout the preceding year.






	TRADING INFORMATION





	The weighted average lives of the notes and the certificates of any series generally will depend on the rate at which the principal balances of the related trust student loans are paid.  Payments may be in the form of scheduled amortization or prepayments, including prepayments resulting from financing alternatives offered through third parties or JPMorgan Chase Bank and its affiliates, including various loan consolidation programs.  For this purpose, prepayments include borrower prepayments in full or in part, including the discharge of trust student loans by consolidation loans or as a result of:




	·




	a borrower default, or death, disability, discharge in bankruptcy of the borrower or the crime of identity theft;




	·




	the closing of the borrower’s school;




	·




	the false certification of the borrower’s eligibility;




	·




	the liquidation of the trust student loan or collection of the related guarantee payments; and




	·




	the reacquisition of a trust student loan by a seller or the depositor or the purchase of a trust student loan by the master servicer.



	All of the trust student loans are prepayable at any time without penalty.


	A variety of economic, social and other factors, including the factors described below, influence the rate at which student loans prepay.  In general, the rate of prepayments may tend to increase when cheaper alternative financing becomes available.  However, because many non-consolidation trust student loans bear interest at a rate that is either actually or effectively floating, it is impossible to predict whether changes in prevailing interest rates will correspond to changes in the interest rates on student loans.


	On the other hand, scheduled payments on the trust student loans, as well as their maturities, may be extended due to applicable grace, deferment and forbearance periods, or for





	67








	other reasons.  The rate of defaults resulting in losses on student loans, as well as the severity and timing of those losses, may affect the principal payments and yield on the securities.  The rate of default also may affect the ability of the guarantors to make guarantee payments.


	Some of the terms of payment that a lender offers to borrowers may extend principal payments on the securities.  A lender may offer some borrowers loan payment terms which provide for an interest-only period, when no principal payments are required, or graduated phased-in amortization of the principal, in which case a greater portion of the principal amortization of the loan occurs in the later stages of the student loan than if amortization were on a level payment basis.  A lender may also offer income-sensitive repayment plans authorized by the Department of Education, under which repayments are based on the borrowers income.  Under these plans, ultimate repayment may be delayed up to five years because forbearance is required to be granted in cases where the effect of decreased installment amounts would result in a loan not being repaid within the maximum repayment term.  If trust student loans have these payment terms, principal payments on the related securities could be affected.  In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank and its affiliates may offer consolidation loans to borrowers of trust student loans.  The making of consolidation loans could increase or decrease the average lives of the notes and certificates and reduce the effective yield on the trust student loans.


	Various incentive programs and repayment programs may be made available from time to time to borrowers of the trust student loans.  See 

	Risk FactorsIncentive Programs May Reduce Payments on Trust Student Loans,

	 

	The Student Loan Financing Business of JPMorgan Chase BankConsolidation/Repayment Programs

	 and


	

	Incentive Programs

	 in this prospectus

	.







	POOL FACTORS





	The pool factor for each class of securities will be a seven-digit decimal computed by the administrator before each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement.  Each pool factor will represent the remaining outstanding balance of the related class, after giving effect to distributions to be made on that Distribution Date, as a fraction of the initial outstanding balance of that class.  Each pool factor will initially be 1.0000000.  Thereafter, it will decline to reflect reductions in the outstanding balance of the applicable class.  Your portion of the aggregate outstanding balance of a class of securities will be the product of:




	·




	the original denomination of your note or certificate; and




	·




	the applicable pool factor.



	Securityholders will receive reports on or about each Distribution Date specified in the related prospectus supplement concerning various matters, including the payments the issuing entity has received on the related trust student loans, the pool balance, the applicable pool factor and various other items of information.  See 

	Reports to Securityholders

	 in this prospectus.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Hello Shareholders. If you want the ability to issue stock with no limits, this is the way to go.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

We do not believe that is usually necessary because it costs $75 and it would be easier to just file the company to see if the name is available.

Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > FAQs > Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Delaware is an easy and reliable state in which to incorporate or form LLCs, plus the annual cost is low and the owners of the LLC as individuals are given the strongest legal protection available by any state. This is demonstrated by a US Chamber of Commerce study of state liability systems that has rated Delaware #1 in all eight studies it has conducted on all 50 states. A few examples of Delaware’s benefits include:Easy and ReliableDelaware law has been tested and provides predictability.Delaware regularly updates its laws to remain the leading state for incorporation.Delaware has a separate Court of Chancery that handles Corporation law cases quickly and competently.Lower CostsThe Delaware Corporation minimum annual franchise tax is $175 and the filing fee is $50.The Delaware LLC annual fee is $300, regardless of capitalization.Delaware does not tax intangible property such as leases or royalties (the “Delaware loophole”).ProtectionPiercing the corporate veil, or making individuals personally liable for claims against their business, is very unlikely in Delaware.Delaware explicitly makes the charging order the sole and exclusive remedy of creditors of LLC members, meaning that creditors of members can only receive distributions from the LLC, and not control foreclosure, or liquidation.

With years of experience, the incorporation specialists at IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) can assist you with any questions you may have about forming a limited liability company in Delaware. IncNow can help you understand topics such as the common provisions included in Operating Agreements and Certificates of Formation.As a Delaware Commercial Registered Agent, IncNow has a higher filing priority than agents outside of Delaware and self-filers, which means your documents are normally returned to you in 1-3 days, not weeks.    How do you form a Delaware LLC?Choose a Delaware LLC NameRegistering a Delaware LLC requires 2 things:Filing a Certificate of FormationDocumenting your Operating AgreementBefore filing the Certificate of Formation, you must first check the prospective business name with the Delaware Secretary of State for conflicts, which can be done online at Incnow.com.Additionally, Delaware law requires that all new LLCs have either “Limited Liability Company”, “LLC”, or “L.L.C.” in the company name. If, at a later date, you want to change your LLC name, you can do so through an Amendment to the Certificate of Formation.Delaware Registered Agent RequirementYou can form an LLC in Delaware without visiting, opening an office, or maintaining a bank account in Delaware; however, the Delaware LLC Act requires any company incorporated in Delaware to have a Delaware Registered Agent with an in-state street address. Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) will act as Registered Agent for companies incorporating in Delaware for a small annual fee.After formation, the Registered Agent receives State of Delaware notices and is required to be generally available during business hours to accept and forward court notices to you (service of process). The Registered Agent will be there for the life of your company, so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable. Agents and Corporations (IncNow) has been a Delaware Registered Agent since 1974, and at the same office since 1982. IncNow is family operated by Delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate law.Delaware Certificate of Formation RequirementsOur office will sign as the authorized person (also known as an organizer) and file a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State’s Division of Corporations to form the Delaware LLC on public record. Your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you. Other states refer to this document as Articles of Organization, but Delaware does not use that term.A Certificate of Formation must include:The name of the LLCThe name and address of the registered agentThe signature of an authorized individualOf special note, if the Delaware LLC is a Series LLC, which protects assets of parts of the LLC from the liabilities of other parts of the LLC, then this must be indicated on the Certificate of Formation (more information on the Series LLC may be found elsewhere on this site). Many optional provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Formation. Upon special request, we can include the names of members and/or managers on the Certificate of Formation.Delaware LLC Operating AgreementWith our complete package, we draft an Operating Agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures. Delaware requires that LLCs have an Operating Agreement that will govern it; however, Delaware does not require that the Operating Agreement be filed with the state, or even be in writing.It is recommended that you have a written, signed agreement. Even in a single-member Delaware LLC, the Operating Agreement is important because it provides a decision-making structure that will benefit the LLC when dealing with other entities, increase protection, and increase credibility for financial transactions. The Operating Agreement will include provisions such as liability, ownership, dissolution, and transfer of interest, among others.Many incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems. A well-crafted Delaware Operating Agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different direction.Signing the LLC Operating AgreementOnce the Delaware Operating Agreement has been drafted and approved, all members should execute it. Most Delaware LLCs, as a practical matter, will not draft and finalize the Operating Agreement until after formation. Many formal requirements of corporations, such as those related to voting and annual meetings, are not required by LLCs.  To this extent, many well-crafted Operating Agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operations.While an Operating Agreement can be enforceable unsigned, it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned Operating Agreement was agreed upon by all members. In multi-member LLCs, it is especially important to have a signed Operating Agreement. Should you change the agreement or ownership structure, an amended and restated LLC Operating Agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes.    Top 10 Reasons to Form an LLC in Delaware1. Delaware LLCs offer the most protection for you and your business with two-way protectionBy forming a Delaware LLC, you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities. This means that, if the business itself cannot pay a creditor, then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets, such as your house, car and other personal possessions.Delaware explicitly makes the “Charging Order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of LLC members. This prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company. Creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the LLC’s distributions to that member, not a control interest or a right to liquidate the LLC.2. Delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any stateDelaware governs the internal affairs of your company, including its liability shield. The corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the Delaware LLC Act, which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business, is thicker than any protection offered in any other state.3. Delaware LLCs can operate in almost any State or CountryYou can form a Delaware LLC no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the United States. Outside the United States, there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a Delaware LLC, and a Delaware LLC does not need to have a bank account or office in Delaware. A Registered Agent, such as IncNow, maintains a physical address in Delaware required to forward court and Delaware government notices to you.4. Delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businessWhen entering into a Delaware LLC, it is flexible in ownership and management structure. One individual can serve as both the owner and manager. An LLC is governed by its Operating Agreement, allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written. Since the LLC is a contractual entity, it is important that the Delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written. Furthermore, there is no required annual general meeting, and there is much less administrative paperwork in general, compared to a corporation.5. Managers are protected from lawsuitsThe LLC Agreement in Delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties. This allows business managers and controlling, managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors, provided such actions are not in bad faith. Even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced, business managers have the freedom to make business decisions, even if losses result without manager liability, provided the decisions are not self-dealing. Even self-dealing is not entirely prohibited; instead, self-dealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members.6. No Delaware income tax if your operations are in other states (and other business tax loopholes)There is no Delaware tax return to file for LLCs that are formed in Delaware, provided they conduct no business in Delaware.As with LLCs in other states, profits are taxed personally at the member level, but not at the LLC level. An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership, unless it elects S-Corporation or C-Corporation tax status.Having an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation can save thousands in self-employment taxes because your income can be split 50/50 between self-employment income and “S-Dividend” income. The S-Dividend can reduce your taxes by thousands. For example, splitting $200,000 of income would save the S-electing LLC member more than $4,000 in social security and Medicare taxes. Learn more about these advantages in our LLC tax tips section.7. Delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsThe Delaware Secretary of State’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour.8. You can use a Delaware LLC to own and manage almost anythingThe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multi-million dollar commercial properties. It may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets, like real estate or intellectual property.Most common uses include:To hold real property, such as personal or business real estateTo operate a service businessTo hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes, automobiles, boats and patents9. Delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks, not yearsDelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes, the Court of Chancery. Its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases, and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not. There are no jury trials in the Court of Chancery, so Court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the Court.The Delaware court system can act very quickly. Sometimes, the whole process, from start to finish (discovery and motions to trial decisions), can be over in two months. Written decisions from the Court of Chancery are the standard, and are often 100 pages long. This well-reasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes. Even appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court can be expedited. The Delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials.10. Delaware has the most pro-business laws of any US stateDelaware’s law is generally thought to be pro-business, and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses. Because of the maturity of Delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by Delaware’s judicial system, there is predictability in outcomes.This means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your LLC, there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome, which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate. Even when judges change, it is not a favoritism or political system. Judges in Delaware make reasoned, non-political decisions.

Did you know?

Some companies sell their services as a package and offer what seems to be an irresistible price, but later they attach fees they did not initially disclose or explain.
By not fully revealing the true nature of their fees, the actual cost of their services adds up quickly and you wind up paying much more than you expected, or wanted, to pay.
Learn  how other business  formation companies  hide their fees.
At Harvard Business Services, Inc., you can rest assured there are no hidden fees. We do not conceal the additional costs you will discover with other business formation companies.

Form an LLC in Delaware.

$49 + State Fee & 1st Year FREE Registered Agent
Start My LLC













Start Your Delaware LLC in 3 Simple Steps
The state of Delaware is home to half of all public and Fortune 500 companies, but that doesn’t mean that small businesses miss out on all its big benefits. As the most popular business entity, the LLC offers Delaware-based owners many tax advantages and asset protections in a state heralded for its strong case law. First, however, it’s vital to know the legal side of getting your business off the ground. Here’s how to form an LLC in the Diamond State.


Step One: Choosing Your LLC’s Name
The first step in starting a new LLC in Delaware is to choose a name. Your new Delaware LLC’s name must be sufficiently different for people to tell it apart from other business entities already on file (registered and reserved) with the state of Delaware. Is the name you want available? You can do a name search at the Delaware Division of Corporations.
The LLC’s name must include at its end “Limited Liability Company,” “L.L.C.,” or “LLC.”
The LLC name is allowed, however, to contain the name of a member or manager, as well as one of the following terms: “Company,” “Association,” “Club,” “Foundation,” “Fund,” “Institute,” “Society,” “Union,” “Syndicate,” “Limited,” or “Trust” (or abbreviations of the same).

Step Two: Creating Your Articles of Organization

After your Delaware LLC is named, you must write your articles of organization and file a certificate of formation with the Delaware Secretary of State, along with a $90 filing fee. Incfile canprovide these services for you.

The certificate must be executed (signed) by one or more authorized persons as laid out in the LLC operating agreement. Organizers may be either natural persons or legal entities, and there must be at least one organizer.
The certificate of formation for your new Delaware LLC must include the following information:

The LLC’s name.
The name and street address of the LLC’s resident agent. See below for Delaware’s rules for registered agents.
The duration of the LLC, either perpetual or for a set amount of time.

The certificate may also include other items that the members wish to include (as long as they don’t conflict with state law), even if they are also included in the operating agreement.
Delaware Registered Agent Rules
All Delaware LLCs are required to have a registered in-state agent. This agent is the person or office designated to receive official state correspondence, including notice if the LLC is served with a lawsuit. A registered agent in Delaware may be an individual state resident; a domestic corporation, limited partnership, LLC, or statutory trust; or a foreign corporation, limited partnership, or LLC authorized to do business in the State of Delaware.
The registered office may be (but is not required to be) the LLC’s place of business. The registered agent must have a business office identical to the registered office, which should generally be open during normal business hours.
Incfile offers registered agent service for your Delaware LLC, if needed.
Your LLC is officially “organized” once the signed original of the certificate of formation is received by the Secretary of State’s office, and is determined to be in compliance with state requirements.
Step three: Writing Your Operating Agreement
Almost as critical for the LLC as the certificate of formation and articles of incorporation is the operating agreement. There isn’t an official state requirement to have an operating agreement, but it’s a vital internal document that specifies how your LLC will operate on both the day-to-day and strategic levels. If there is more than one member, the operating agreement must initially be approved unanimously in writing by the members.
The operating agreement should list:

The LLC’s members (see below for how membership works).
Specify how much each member has invested.
Explain how profits will be divided.
State how much proportional “weight” each member has when issues are voted upon. Unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement say otherwise, voting power in a member-managed LLC is vested in each member according to his or her current capital account balance with the LLC.
The operating agreement may also set forth meeting requirements such as the amount of required notice, what constitutes a quorum, voting rules, and so on, but they are not necessary.
Most operating agreement list requirements for the LLC that are already listed in Delaware state law and regulations. It can also include such items as restrictions or constraints on the power of the members to adopt, amend, or repeal the operating agreement.

Unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement itself state otherwise, unanimous consent of the LLC’s membership is required to amend the operating agreement.
How Membership Works in a Delaware LLC
An LLC is required to have at least one member. Members may become a member of or acquire an interest in the LLC when it is first started, or when the new member’s admission is recorded in the LLC’s records.
To join the LLC, the prospective member usually needs to make some kind of contribution — for example, pay cash or transfer property to the LLC — or undertake a binding obligation to do so.
A member can only resign from the LLC in a manner allowed by the certificate of formation and/or the operating agreement. One or both of these documents will also usually state the minimum amount of time a member can maintain membership before being allowed to resign.
When a member resigns, he or she is entitled to receive the fair value of the membership interest within a reasonable time after the resignation (unless, of course, either the certificate of formation or operating agreement specify otherwise).
If the resignation or withdrawal of a member violates the provisions in the operating agreement, then the amount payable to the former member is the fair market value of his interest reduced by the amount of damages sustained by the LLC or its other members as a result of the violation. In this case, the LLC may also defer the payment for as long as needed to prevent unreasonable hardship to the organization.
Delaware’s Ongoing Requirements and Taxes
Compared to many other states, Delaware has minimal reporting and disclosure requirements for LLCs, and most of those come in the form of taxes and fees.
All LLCs and corporations formed in the State of Delaware are required to file an annual report and to pay a flat annual franchise tax for a total cost of $300. The annual report filing fee is $25. Taxes and annual reports are to be received by March 1st of each year. The minimum tax is $75, with a maximum tax of $165,000. The filing due date for an LLC is June 1, and corporations are due March 1. Franchise tax fees vary based on entity type.
When you use Incfile services, we send you reminder emails at the approach of each ongoing requirement due date.
Dissolution of an LLC in Delaware
An LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the certificate of formation or operating agreement.
A unanimous member vote to dissolve (unless a certain percentage or proportion is stated in the certificate of formation or operating agreement).
An event that makes it unlawful for the LLC to continue.
The LLC’s duration as specified in the certificate of formation or the operating agreement expires (if the LLC is not perpetual).
A court order ordering dissolution.

If the sole remaining member of the LLC resigns or withdraws, the Delaware LLC will automatically dissolve. This dissolution may be prevented if, within 90 days, the personal representative of the last member agrees to continue the LLC. The representative must also consent to serve as an LLC member or appoint another person in his or her place.

Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
