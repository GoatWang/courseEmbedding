To approve the increase in authorized share capital to 25,000,000,000 shares of common stock (“Common stock”) (the “Common Stock Authorized Share Capital Increase”);          2.  To approve the increase in authorized share capital to 55,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Authorized Share Capital Increase”);             Nov 11, 2016  Hybrid Key Milestones Accomplished For 2016 And General Outlook for 2017 San Francisco CA, November 9, 2016 -- (MARKET WIRE) – Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc. (HCTI: OTCBB) is issuing this press release to summarize the key milestones achieved by the company in 2016 and to give a general outlook for 2017. Coatings in 2016: Industrial Finishes & Systems, Hybrid’s distributor in the U.S., has made significant progress in distributing Hybrid’s products around the U.S. with large flooring installations in various parts of the U.S. Hybrid is currently working with IF to carry out new independent testing of its products, which will allow it to further distinguish the mechanical and chemical resistance superiority of its products over other products in the market. Hybrid made significant progress in establishing sales in Europe. The company is now currently working with companies who plan to use Hybrid’s proprietary zero isocyanate catalysts in Italy, France, Spain and Germany. The company has also put a significant amount of time and effort into lowering its manufacturing costs. Part of this effort includes the setup of a new toll manufacturer now manufacturing Green Polyurethane™ for Hybrid in Europe to serve its European based clients. The company made considerable in-roads in Southeast Asia in 2016. After testing at Chinese state agencies, Hybrid’s floor coating formulations were found to be far superior to conventional floor coating systems currently on the market. Hybrid now has multiple Chinese companies who have tested its products and who now want to do large scale field trials. The company is also working with top 5 coatings companies in South Korea and Japan who are interested in Hybrid’s zero isocyanate polyurethane. In 2016 one of Hybrid’s Fortune 500 coatings partners used Hybrid’s zero isocyanate catalyst to develop and launch their own commercial coating product with a second product also expected to be launched. Foam in 2016: Hybrid entered into a joint development agreement with a Fortune 500 partner with a potential $20M per year revenue for Hybrid post development and after a reasonable ramp up period. The company entered into advanced discussions with a Fortune 500 company to jointly develop a foam product with a $10 billion addressable market. Hybrid also entered into advanced discussions with a company for a joint development agreement for a foam product with a $35 billion addressable market. 2017: Hybrid expects to start generating approximately $2 million in consistent revenues in 2017 comprised of $1.2M from its US coating distributor, as per its distribution agreement, and approximately $800,000 from several European coating manufacturers and distributors. Hybrid is not factoring any revenues from any foam products, however, it is possible that one or more foam products may be ready for commercialization during 2017.  http://www.hybridcoatingtech.com/pdf/Key_Milestones_11_9_16.pdf  ***  Sept 22, 2016 Hybrid Head Scientist Wins Gold Medal From IFIS For Core Technology Patent San Francisco CA, November 1, 2016 -- (MARKET WIRE) – Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc. (HCTI:OTCBB) is pleased to announce that its head scientist, Dr. Oleg Figovsky, has won two gold medals from the International Federation of Inventor’s Association (IFIA) for two of Hybrid’s non-isocyanate polyurethane platform technology patents.

The product’s lack of noticeable odor cannot be overlooked. Exceptional Durability – With proper floor preparation, TRUE Green Poly™ provides a finish that can withstand trafficand heavy equipment, repeated cleaning, and no diminished gloss. 100% Solids – TRUE Green Poly™ is a “true” 100% solids product. No evaporation; no shrinkage. For your application this means greater coverage witha smaller amount of material. It’s easy to achieve your desired thickness in one coat with TRUE Green Poly™, saving you time, money and hassle. Anti-Corrosive – In environments such as kitchens or agricultural operations, TRUE Green Poly™ can withstand exposure to caustic chemicals that often destroy other coatings.          INTRODUCING THE WORLD’S FIRST (AND ONLY) ZERO ISOCYANATE HYBRID POLYURETHANE INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL COATINGS. The first-ever modified hybrid polyurethane (currently used in coatings and paint) manufactured without the use of toxic isocyanates throughout the entire production process. The result is TRUE Green Poly™, a substitute for conventional polyurethane and epoxies that is hundreds of times less toxic, has superior properties, and may provide up to 30-60% in reduced application costs. TRUE Green Poly™ featuring Green Polyurethane™ is the first commercially-available zero isocyanate hybrid polyurethane coating.  						The product emits such low odor that it can be applied in environments that make conventional toxic, isocyanate-based polyurethane coatings difficult to use, such as hospitals and schools. TRUE Green Poly™ is perfect for new construction as well as recondition projects with “green” considerations or seeking LEED certification. TRUE Green Poly™ provides an appealing choice for a wide range of projects due to its ease of application, exceptional durability, and competitive costs. 						  Recently, Green Polyurethane™ was the recipient of the prestigious 2015 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cooperation with the 						American Chemical Society. The award program, supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, recognizes “landmark green chemistry technologies developed by industrial pioneers and leading scientists in the field of green chemistry.” According to Industrial Finishes & Systems Chairman and CEO, Stuart Barr, “We’re excited to have the opportunity to bring this much-needed product to market. This is truly a game-changer. In today’s world, eliminating harmful VOCs and isocyanates, is an increasingly important focus. HCT’s chemistry allows us to bring products to market that eliminate isocyanates while providing a superior finish and easy application.” “Industrial Finishes has a strong management team with a vision toward the future of coatings. They also have a highly motivated sales team with a record of success. We believe this will be an exceptional partnership and are excited about the product launch,” said Joseph Kristul, President and CEO of HCT.

This makes the material highly vulnerable to environmental degradation and ultimately leads to their chemical decomposition, especially when in contact with water. Conventional PU foams such as spray foam insulation are applied via a spraying mechanism that sends toxic isocyanates in the air — exposing workers to the dangers of toxic isocyanates. Strict and costly health & safety measures have to be implemented in the manufacture and application of conventional polyurethane due to the toxicity of isocyanates. This is why regulatory bodies around the world are now                                                 looking toward phasing out the use of isocyanates. The Green Polyurethane™ Solution Green Polyurethane™ (also referred to as “HNIPU” – hybrid non-isocyanate polyurethane) is a “hybrid” material that combines the high chemical resistance properties of epoxy and advanced durability and wear resistance properties of polyurethane, making it the perfect coating application for sanitary, high traffic and corrosive surface areas. Green Polyurethane™ provides the foundation of the TRUE Green Poly™ line of commercial floor coatings and paint. As a hybrid material with superior properties, Green Polyurethane™ can be applied in one or two coatings, providing a welcome cost-saving substitute to currently used multi-layered coating applications. Its safety features allow it to be applied without the interruption of business due to public exposure, creating an additional 30-60% savings on application costs for customers. As a foam, Green Polyurethane™ provides high R values up to 6.0, energy savings up to 30% and improved tensile strength over conventional foam without using dangerous isocyanates. Recent Anti-Isocyanate Regulatory Pressure US EPA MDI Action Plan: The US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is taking progressive action to regulate and potentially ban isocyanates and has mentioned Hybrid’s technology as an alternative to toxic polyurethane in its MDI Action Plan against isocyanates (see page 4 Figovsky and Shapovalov). OSHA National Emphasis Program: On June 25, 2013 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a division of the US Department of Labor, initiated a National Emphasis Program to protect workers from the serious health effects from occupational exposure to isocyanates. Isocyanates are found in polyurethane based products. According to OSHA, “Workers exposed to isocyanates can suffer debilitating health problems for months or even years after exposure which could result in death.” California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) on March 13, 2014 selected isocyanates and two others substances from a list of 1,100 toxic components that it will focus on with the goal of potentially banning them altogether within the next two years. The announcement is part of a bigger effort to educate consumers and manufacturers about product safety under the Green-Chemistry Law, which went into effect in California last year. Under the law, the agency has jurisdiction to ban these products altogether after following proper protocol. That process includes workshops, a public comment period and requiring manufacturers that want to sell these products in California to determine whether it would be feasible to use safer ingredients. The US EPA on January 8, 2015 announced that it was taking action to protect consumers from new uses and imports of harmful isocyanates in polyurethane. The EPA’s proposed action, a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), would require manufacturers (including importers) to notify the EPA at least 90 days before starting or resuming new uses of isocyanates in polyurethane based consumer products. The EPA would then have the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of and if necessary, to take action to prohibit or limit all products containing over one tenth of one percent of the chemical including imported products that make their way into the United States. Industrial Finishes & Systems is proud to be the exclusive distributor for TRUE Green Poly™, the first and only isocyanate-free architectural floor and wall coatings. For more information, contact Industrial Finishes & Systems.                   HYBRID COATING TECHNOLOGIES 			Hybrid Coating Technologies (HCTI-OTCBB) is a San Francisco-based innovator focused on improving the quality and safety of coatings, foam and adhesives.
