We scheduled a meeting with Dallas immigration lawyer Mr. Martin Valko of Chavez & Valko, and asked him what he thought about our case.In April 2008 we received our L- 1A Visa (L2 for the family) to establish a new office of our German Software Company in the US. Unfortunately we were not able to leave Germany before October 2008. In December 2008 we asked our prior attorney to apply for the extension of the Visa. He filed the application for the extension of the L1-A Visa in April 2009 (5 months later). Instead of answering the INS request for evidence (RFE), he tried to change the Visa application from L1-A into a L1-B. The US immigration denied the petition because we were not able to change the status for a filed petition. To do so, we would have had to file a new one. However, not worst enough, he told us not to leave the US and to stay during he was filing a petition for a B1 Visa to gain additional time to prepare a new L1-A application.Mr. Martin Valko took on our case. He told us that it will be difficult but he would try to rescue the case, thoroughly explained the case to us after his analysis of the immigration laws and regulations, and promised us to do the best. After he had all our paperwork, he and his legal team needed only a few days to prepare the new L1-A petition (L-2 for the family). We used the premium processing service of the USCIS, and we had our approval after less than one week!!!  We then scheduled a visa appointment at the US Consulate in Berlin, Germany the following week, and our new L-1A and L-2 visas have been granted for a full one year!When searching for a good immigration attorney, you will find thousands of attorneys and all of them promise to be the best and to do the best work. After all this experience we can tell, that there are only a few really good immigration attorney out there and it is hard to find them. We found one of them and are proud of this work, and we can't thank him enough. Mr. Martin Valko knows what he is talking about! He has a lot of experience in immigration law and his rates are absolutely fair. For all of those people in need of an immigration attorney, we recommend the law firm of Chavez & Valko in Dallas, TX."- Provox Systems, Dallas, TXChavez & Valko, LLPweetabixtourist ratedThis is crazy!I don't doub...This is crazy!I don't doubt that the other attorneys are good, I'm sure they are but I'm gonna talk about Gary Frost. Gary Frost is amazing. I called the law firm in tears and he made me see that I was over stressing about something that was not even a problem at all.My abusive ex boyfriend (who is like totally trashy and lame) filed a k-1 petition and talked me into signing it during the time that I was on zoloft and xanax (due to the stress in the relationship), which I did (love makes people act stupid)Later on, when I realized he cheated on me, I cancelled it.My main concern was knowing that this would cause trouble later on (like for example when I go to the states on vacation because me and my family have been going there since I was like two). I was stressed and I appreciate his kind words (which meant so much to me) as well as his legal advice. He broke with all the stereotypes of the mean and cold attorneys. Now in spanish!!!No se que tal sean los otros abogados pero yo voy a hablar de Gary Frost. Llame a las oficinas asi como que llorando y me hizo ver que estaba asi como que preocupandome por algo que nada que ver!!El naco de mi ex novio dio de alta una peticion k-1, y me convencio de iniciar todo el rollo. Y cuando me di cuenta que el muy loser me engaño pues obvio que la quise cancelar, osea nadie va andar con alguien que lo trate mal (y encima hablaba mal de los mexicanos a veces solo por ser el norteamericano, osea, que le pasaba?)Mi preocupacion principal era saber que estoy me pudiera afectar en un futuro, y el me hizo saber que no tenia porque preocuparme, de una manera bastante amigable. Aprecio mucho su asesoria legal, pero aun mas sus palabras de aliento cuando yo estaba toda nerviosa y desesperada y necesitaba escuchar que todo iba a estar bien.Chavez & Valko, LLPTerry H. ratedWe did it! My wife is coming to America! No words can ever convey my heartfelt thanks to Chavez and Valko’s ~ Martin Valko and Eduardo Amaro. My heart is full of joy as I write the following…The law firm of Chavez and Valko was referred to me by an acquaintance and I met with Martin Valko immediately upon returning from my wedding in Zhengzhou China and I liked him very much.  The road to a successful migration can be a perilous one. Never dreaming our case would require almost five years and three Visa Interviews to complete. The US Department of State made several errors that no one could have foreseen. The US Consulate in Guangzhou sent our case back (2) times and Chavez and Valko reaffirmed it and then finally on the third try the Consulate Visa Officers realized ours was a bona fide marriage. I know this placed additional burden and countless man-hours on Chavez and Valko. I was concerned when our first Visa interview was not successful in March 2010 and I was concerned the Law Firm would drop us as clients. I met with Mr. Valko and he put all my worries to rest. They are true to their word and a Law Firm of the highest honor. Mr. Valko and Mr. Amaro our paralegal never once wavered and I can’t imagine anyone, anywhere, at anytime fighting any harder for our case all these years. They paid the closest of attention to slightest of details. When we gave up they kept fighting for us. Chavez and Valko’s Law Firm has grown in size since over the last five years but those assigned to our case in the beginning…remained on our case until the very end. May God bless the Law Firm of Chavez and Valko and their staff members. !!Chavez & Valko, LLPfelipenvanessa.rosas ratedWe would like to thank Mr. Val...We would like to thank Mr. Valko and his paralegal, Jessica for their help and hard work. My husband is from Mexico and has been here since he was eight years old. Originally, we contacted Mr. Valko's office to help my husband get a visa. In the meantime, the new Deferred Action came out and Mr. Valko suggested that we go this route since it appeared that my husband met the criteria. Immigration received my husband's application for Deferred Action in September 2012, he went to his biometrics appointment in mid-October 2012, received an approval notification in mid-November 2012 and three days letter received his work permit in the mail. Now, he has his Social Security card and driver license. No more worries that my husband will go to work one day and not return home because he was picked up by immigration. Again, we are so thankful and appreciative for the great work Mr. Valko and Jessica have done for us. They always return your call or email very quickly and you don't always get that kind of service from attorney's offices. Mr. Valko exuded confidence in our case and his expertise and that in turn eased our minds a great deal. We felt like we were treated as human beings by people who cared about our situation. There is still more to do and we will stay with Mr. Valko because we can trust him. If he can help you, then he will. If he cannot help you, he will be honest and tell you so. If you have any immigration issues, this is the office to go to. We have recommended Mr. Valko to other family, our friends and strangers that we have heard are in need of immigration assistance. Vanessa & Felipe RosasWarren N. Abrams Attorney at LawKenyan G. ratedThe law offices of Warren Abram are the best legal representation one could ever ask for. From the first day, I walked into their office, I knew that they had my best interests at heart and my case would be handled with a sincere personal touch. I felt like I was among family. The office staff, Rhea and Rose were very personable yet professional and kept me informed about where in the process my case was and advised me accordingly on what the next step was. My attorney, Mr. Abram is an outstanding lawyer and an absolute asset to have on your side. Even before taking on my case, he listened intently, was extremely compassionate and very thorough in explaining to me what we would be facing and what needed to be done to achieve a positive outcome. He is very knowledgeable of the court system and always seemed to be steps ahead and able to foresee any curve ball that was thrown at us. All throughout my case he was always available to answer my questions and especially very prompt at returning my calls. He was also very comforting and quick to alleviate my worries when I would panic. He is also very understanding of the financial burden of legal representation and willing to let me pay him in installments which most other attorneys would not let you do. His preparation was extremely detailed and he was relentless in his pursuit for a positive verdict. He fought for me and won my case and I am forever thankful for his dedication and expertise. At the end, I felt he was like a father to me, trying to protect me and my career. One needs to look no further for representation as he is an amazing attorney.Chavez & Valko, LLPRafael P. ratedHi my name is Rafael Pantoja im originally from Mexico but im a resident allien who was raise in the state of California.This past January I was detained by Imigration at the Dallas airport when I did my connecting Flight From mexico to Dallas and Then to Sacramento California.Do to some 2 arrest in the past For Drug posesion which I did clear out years ago they still detained me and I was sent to Johnson County Jail in Clearburn texas till i saw a Judge, My Family find Out about CHAVEZ & VALKO FIRM in the internet or by some relative, and hired then to help me with my case. they started the processes so quick and the day MR.GARY FROST came to me I could Felt He was going to help Me, I also felt these Law Firm also cares not just about money but they do care for you and your family, Mr Gary Frost Never promise me noting ,But He did promise he was gonna do his BEST...

THANK YOU SOO MUCH GARY FROST AND CHAVEZ & VALKO GOD BLESS YOU GUYSChavez & Valko, LLPthatman ratedAfter almost 10 years in the US immigration process I finally received my US permanent residency (Green Card) in August 2013. This is life changing in so many areas. I work in a mid-management position for a Fortune 500 company in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex area and sometime in the mid-2000s, my company migrated its immigration legal representatives from a very expensive Washington DC area firm to the much more affordable firm of Chavez & Valko in the DFW area. While there were a few parties involved in my process, the champions have been Martin Valko and his team of Paralegals (including the ever available Shannon) at Chavez & Valko. As anyone who may have gone through the US immigration system can attest, the suspense and uncertainties in the process can be a teeth grinding experience. Throughout my dual intent H1B & PERM process Martin and his team kept me updated, performed timely execution of the series of USCIS document filing and notifications, State Department visa applications, provided me and my family reassurance during USCIS delays, and pretty much held my hands through it all. I am very grateful for their hard work, proactive professionalism, dedication to my personal process, and uncompromising commitment to deliver. I am already gladly recommending the firm of Chavez & Valko to family, friends and anyone else who may have any form of immigration issues whether they are being handled through their corporate/employer sponsorship or personally. Eric Fein & Associates, Attorney at Lawchristopherindallas ratedEric Fein is in a class all to...Eric Fein is in a class all to himself.  When you need the toughest attorney willing to do whatever it takes to win your case, you need Eric Fein.  Eric specializes in Business, Corporation, Insurance, Intellectual Property among other areas.  However, what Eric Fein most specializes in is winning.  He's like a pit bull, once he gets a hold of the other side he doesn't let go.  Eric has represented me in a number of cases and has always delivered a positive outcome, even when the odds were stacked against.  I have seen Eric take on the largest of insurance companies that have unlimited resources and were willing to do anything to deny a claim, even though it was a valid claim.  When Eric was done they didn't know what hit them.  He did circles around them and showed them that the law was not on their side, and neither was he.  In the end, it wound up costing the insurance company a whole lot more than if they would have just paid the claim in the first place. And this type of outcome is typical with Eric Fein.  Eric is not a low cost attorney and he typically charges by the hour, but the end value he delivers is well worth it.  When you  absolutely need to win and want the toughest guy in town willing to do whatever it takes to win, Eric Fein is your guy.  If you are an insurance company and Eric Fein is the opposing counsel in a claim, you are screwed and better pay now because the outcome will not be in your favor.  On a scale of 1-10 Eric Fein gets an 11. Chavez & Valko, LLPswarans ratedI’m a Sr.Netweaver administrator at a Fortune 500 company which manufactures and distributes steel.  My company retains Chavez & Valko immigration law firm and their corporate immigration team initially assisted my company with the transfer of my H-1B and H-4 petitions from my previous employer. After I was “ported” the company filed a new labor PERM application in a faster category and the I-140 petition was then filed to recapture my earlier priority date from my old petition which was successful.  Our cases were not very simple as the I-485 green card applications for me and my wife were accepted first without our kids.  During this time Martin Valko and his paralegals worked relentlessly on my cases, communicated with USCIS, and even conferenced me into a call to make sure that all of the cases were consolidated. What sets this team apart from other attorneys I worked with in the past is that they were always accessible and provided me with regular updates and answered my calls or emails sometimes within minutes.  After the priority dates became current this year we received a call from Martin that our green cards are being produced and that was the best news for me and my family as we have been in this immigration process for many years. I would recommend Chavez & Valko to my family and friends without hesitation and not only in employment cases but also for deportation and family immigration needs. Their team is the best.Swaran S. with family.Chavez & Valko, LLPhrmgr13 ratedI am a Human Resource Manager at a Fortune 500 company with over 100 locations in 12 countries.  We have been working with Martin Valko and his employment-based immigration team at Chavez & Valko for almost 5 years and our experience has been great.   Martin’s team handles all of our immigration and employer compliance needs, and to date has successfully completed over 150 matters. The cases include H-1B, L-1A, L-1B and TN petitions, the respective visa applications at consulates, PERMs, I-140 petitions, green card applications as well as applications for employment and travel authorizations.  They are very professional, prompt to answer our calls and emails (even during holidays and weekends), and they navigate through the maze of complex laws with absolute ease. For example, with longer green card wait times, they skillfully prepared new labor certifications and petition in the faster category so that several of our employees received their green cards faster.  The major advantage of working with Martin’s team over large national immigration law firms we used in the past is that Martin’s team is quick, efficient, and reliable and the end result is a great value to the company. I can call Martin or any other team member for a quick chat without having to schedule the meeting in advance, and I don’t receive an itemized invoice for such a call which is very important to us in this economy. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
