DENVER, Nov. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- General Cannabis Corporation (OTCQB: CANN), the comprehensive resource to the regulated cannabis industry, announced today that Duncan Levin, the managing partner of Tucker Levin, PLLC, and former federal prosecutor, has been elected to the Board of Directors. 








Levin is a highly respected expert in the legal aspects of anti-money laundering, internal investigations, and anti-fraud.  After a lengthy career at the senior-most levels of state and federal law enforcement, Mr. Levin now regularly consults with a variety of businesses facing complex challenges, including regulatory, investigatory, and anti-fraud issues. Prior to founding Tucker Levin, he served as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice specializing in money laundering and asset forfeiture and on the senior staff of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where he was Chief of Asset Forfeiture and supervised money laundering cases.  
As the forfeiture chief for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., Levin oversaw all criminal and civil asset forfeiture and money laundering on a wide variety of cases, including international corruption, white-collar fraud, identity theft, organized crime, terrorist financing, and narcotics cases. He was the primary liaison with U.S. Department of Justice on the forfeiture of $1.9 billion in the HSBC OFAC sanctions case and $350 million in Standard Chartered OFAC sanctions case, as well as the OFAC/AML cases against BNP Paribas and ING.
"Duncan's background and expertise helps elevate General Cannabis to a new level of industry-leading professionalism," said Robert Frichtel, Chief Executive Officer of General Cannabis Corp. "His unique perspective on complex legal issues will help us navigate through uncharted territory in our burgeoning industry and position General Cannabis as the premier consulting firm in the field"
"General Cannabis is poised to be the unparalleled industry leader, and I'm delighted to join the board during this period of dynamic growth," said Levin. "The Cannabis industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country's economy, and General Cannabis is well positioned to be the leader in all aspects of providing the widest possible range of support services ranging from real estate and grow facilities to security and financing."
Prior to joining the District Attorney's Office, Levin served as an Assistant United States Attorney at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, where he handled money laundering, asset forfeiture, and Bank Secrecy Act cases.  He reported in that position to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who is now the United States Attorney General.Levin is a graduate of Yale College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and Yale Law School. He started his legal career as a line prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, focusing on financial crime. Levin has lectured extensively on money laundering, suspicious activity reporting, AML/OFAC, and asset forfeiture for the U.S. Department of Justice and the District Attorney's Office. He serves on the Criminal Law committee of the Bar Association for the City of New York.

Prior to founding Tucker Levin, he served as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice specializing in money laundering and asset forfeiture and on the senior staff of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where he was Chief of Asset Forfeiture and supervised money laundering cases. As the forfeiture chief for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., Levin oversaw all criminal and civil asset forfeiture and money laundering on a wide variety of cases, including international corruption, white-collar fraud, identity theft, organized crime, terrorist financing, and narcotics cases. He was the primary liaison with U.S. Department of Justice on the forfeiture of $1.9 billion in the HSBC OFAC sanctions case and $350 million in Standard Chartered OFAC sanctions case, as well as the OFAC/AML cases against BNP Paribas and ING."Duncan's background and expertise helps elevate General Cannabis to a new level of industry-leading professionalism," said Robert Frichtel, Chief Executive Officer of General Cannabis Corp. "His unique perspective on complex legal issues will help us navigate through uncharted territory in our burgeoning industry and position General Cannabis as the premier consulting firm in the field""General Cannabis is poised to be the unparalleled industry leader, and I'm delighted to join the board during this period of dynamic growth," said Levin. "The Cannabis industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country's economy, and General Cannabis is well positioned to be the leader in all aspects of providing the widest possible range of support services ranging from real estate and grow facilities to security and financing."Prior to joining the District Attorney's Office, Levin served as an Assistant United States Attorney at the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, where he handled money laundering, asset forfeiture, and Bank Secrecy Act cases.  He reported in that position to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who is now the United States Attorney General.  Levin is a graduate of Yale College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and Yale Law School. He started his legal career as a line prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, focusing on financial crime. Levin has lectured extensively on money laundering, suspicious activity reporting, AML/OFAC, and asset forfeiture for the U.S. Department of Justice and the District Attorney's Office. He serves on the Criminal Law committee of the Bar Association for the City of New York.About General CannabisGeneral Cannabis Corporation is the comprehensive resource for the highest quality service providers available to the regulated Cannabis Industry.

The world's most popular humbucker. Provides slammin' output while retaining singing highs, aggressive harmonics, and just the right blend of sustain and distortion. Goes from sweet warm tones to raw rock 'n' roll. Compared to the SH-14 Custom 5, the JB has a stronger treble detail. Some players use it with 250K pots to smooth out the highs. Comes with four-conductor hookup cable.
Available in Nickel or gold-plated cover. Trembucker. 7-string version. Available in matched set of SH-4 JB Model bridge and SH-2n Jazz Model neck
