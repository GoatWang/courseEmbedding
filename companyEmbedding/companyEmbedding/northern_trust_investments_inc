As a retirement plan advisor you have the amazing, yet daunting, task of guiding investments in the approximately $4 Trillion US retirement market.
Helping your clients design well-constructed plans that may provide a positive outcome for their participants is critical. At Northern Trust we understand the challenges you face as you seek to educate your clients and their participants while providing sound investment solutions. Northern Trust manages more than $105 Billion in defined contribution assets for mid-to-large corporate plans. While the size of the plans you service may be smaller, the demands by plan sponsors and participants are not.
Northern Trust offers a diverse set of solutions that can help meet the needs of nearly any sized plan. These include a broad selection of index and active equity and income funds. At Northern Trust, we believe more can be done to drive financial success at retirement. Please take a look at our ongoing Defined Contribution research – The Path Forward – which reveals what plan participants think about plan sponsors’ efforts to help them achieve more desirable results at retirement.

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas.

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

Put risk to work in your favor
Did you know? Factors drove nearly all excess returns over the past 50 years. Read more in Factor-Based Investing Q&A.
















Understanding Factor Investing

An introduction to factors: why have they created excess returns and how can they be combined to be even more effective? 





.






 




Evaluating the Efficiency of Smart Beta Indices

On average, the most popular smart beta products only captured 17% of the factor they targeted. Our global equity team explains why.





.






 




Combining Risk Factors for Superior Returns

Strong factors work better when combined because they smooth returns over time. Even more, mixing the quality factor with other factors is especially powerful.




.






 




What is the Quality Factor?

Quality is the most powerful factor, but the hardest to define. Learn how Northern Trust Asset Management defines it — and how our propriety quality score precisely targets this valuable factor.

Factor-Based Investing Q&A
What is factor-based investing?
Over the past 50 years, research shows that virtually all outperformance in the stock market has been driven by factors*.  Investors create factor investments by grouping stocks with similar characteristics such as quality, size, momentum, dividend yields, low volatility and value.
Is factor-based investing the same as smart beta?
Smart beta has become the industry catch-all term for investment strategies that use alternatively weighted approaches, unlike traditional products weighted by market capitalization. While many smart beta products target equity factors by weighting certain underlying company characteristics, they can be inefficient. The best factor-based investing strategies target intended factors, while controlling for unintended risks, to deliver the most efficient factor exposure possible.

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

History[edit]
Northern Trust was founded in 1889 by Byron Laflin Smith in a one-room office in the Rookery Building in Chicago's Loop, with a focus on providing trust and banking services for the city's prosperous citizens.[6] Smith provided 40% of the bank's original capitalization of $1 million, and counted such businessmen and civic leaders as Marshall Field, Martin A. Ryerson, and Philip D. Armour among the original 27 shareholders. Intimately acquainted with the operations of the bank, these men would personally examine Northern's assets and records at each year's end.
In October 1929, however, the flamboyant decade of the 1920s came to a sudden halt—the stock market crash led to a spectacular drop in prices, employment and production. As these troubles swept across the country, one bank after another closed. Two days after his inauguration on March 6, 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt closed all the banks in the United States. When they reopened a short time later, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what might occur. Fortunately, the people in line outside the Northern bank offices were there to deposit money instead of withdraw it. Northern's conservative policies had served it well during the 1920s.[7]




The company's headquarters building at 50 South LaSalle Street in the Financial District of Chicago was completed in 1905 and was designed by Frost and Granger.[8] It is shown here in 1907.


By 1941 nearly half of all the bank's commercial accounts were drawn from outside the Chicago metropolitan area. During World War II, Northern once again took part in the government's war bond drives, and also provided loans for manufacturing war materials under special government programs. The war created more opportunities for the bank; all sectors of its business expanded, and by 1945 the Northern Trust had doubled in size.
The years after World War II brought even greater prosperity to the bank as it continued to expand its services. Still under the direction of Solomon Smith, management at the bank became more aware of electronic data processing and how this new technology could revolutionize the banking industry. During the 1950s, Northern was at the forefront of developing numerous automated banking services, including the first fully automated financial statements for trust clients.
When Solomon Smith died in 1963 and his son, Edward Byron Smith, assumed leadership of the bank, assets totaled more than $1 billion. Near the end of the decade, Northern became the first state-chartered bank from Illinois to open an office outside the United States.
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Northern Trust acquired companies and expanded into Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. When oil prices dropped suddenly in the early 1980s, many South American nations realized they could not pay off their enormous bank loans. Northern suffered uncharacteristically high losses. Aggressive management, loan reserves, and write-off enabled the bank to restore its asset quality.
When Edward Byron Smith retired in 1979, he was succeeded by E. Norman Staub, followed a few years later by Philip W. K. Sweet, and then by Weston Christopherson, who is credited with guiding the bank through a difficult period when sour loans to Latin American countries were hurting profits. During Christopherson's six years at Northern Trust, profits rose from $34 million to $113 million[9] He continued with Northern Trust until his retirement in 1990, at which time Northern Trust was the 11th most profitable of the 100 largest banks in the United States.[10] When company veteran David W. Fox took over, he was only the seventh chief executive in the bank's existence. William A. Osborn was named president and chief operating officer in 1993 and became chairman and chief executive officer, in addition to president, in 1995. He stepped down as president in 2006 and as CEO on January 1, 2008. Frederick H. "Rick" Waddell then became president and CEO.
Northern Trust counts over 20% of the U.S.'s wealthiest families as its clients. It is also one of the largest global custodians in the world, serving the asset servicing needs of corporate and public retirement, foundations, endowment, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
