Investment Management



At Godsey & Gibb, we respect the uniqueness of each client’s investment needs and expectations.
The portfolio management process focuses on the investment goals and objectives of each individual client. We want to have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance, expectations for capital growth as well as your need for income. With that understanding, we work with you to establish an investment objective that will serve as our guide in the construction and ongoing management of your portfolio. We are a moderately conservative management firm, focusing first and foremost on preservation of capital. With this in mind, we work to structure your portfolio in a manner that best meets your needs.
After we have established your goals and investment objectives, we will begin active management of your investments. In keeping with our risk-averse philosophy, we will take a gradual approach to fully investing your portfolio, taking into consideration many factors including market conditions and the current structuring of your portfolio.
We will communicate regularly, through quarterly reports, market commentary, and periodic meetings.  Investment decision-makers are always accessible should you have any questions about your portfolio.  We want you to understand not just what investment decisions we made, but why we made them. As your needs and goals change over time we work with you to modify your investment objectives to be consistent with those life changes, then restructure your portfolio accordingly.

Firm History



A lot has happened in the past 30 years, and we are looking forward to the next 30.
Frank B. Gibb, III and Joseph C. Godsey Jr. formed Godsey & Gibb Wealth Management in 1985 in Richmond, Virginia to fill a need for investment advice tailored to each client’s specific needs. They brought with them a broad range of professional experience in investment and relationship management, as well as an investment discipline that was developed throughout the challenging financial markets of the mid-to-late 1970s. Ephraim Ulmer joined the firm in 1991 and opened the branch in Columbia, South Carolina. Joe retired from Godsey & Gibb in 1998. Since then we have opened branch offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Greenville, South Carolina. Now in our second generation, we serve clients in over 20 states and the District of Columbia.   
Corporate Culture
The culture at Godsey & Gibb represents the foundation of how we perform our work, serve our clients and conduct ourselves each day. Integrity, knowledge, professionalism, and commitment are attributes that distinguish our organization and keep us together. 
Integrity
We strive to do the right things every day to safeguard and grow the wealth of our clients.
Knowledge
We are highly informed about the economy and complex financial markets, and this serves as a strong basis for our investment decisions.
Professionalism
We are respectful, courteous and sensitive at all times to our clients, business partners and each other.
Commitment
By maintaining personal relationships with our clients we have a clear understanding of their evolving financial needs and goals. This allows us to be a valuable partner in attaining those goals.
