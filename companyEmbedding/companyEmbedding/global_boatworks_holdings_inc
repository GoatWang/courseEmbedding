	BUSINESS










	Overview



	We are incorporated in the state of Florida on May 11, 2015, to acquire our wholly owned subsidiary Global Boatworks, LLC, a Florida limited liability company formed on June 16, 2014, to commercialize upscale stationary vessels built on a barge bottom. We own two (2) vessels, the Miss Leah, which we acquired from a related party on September 25, 2014, as a prototype and to operate as a short term rental in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts and Luxuria I, which was completed subsequent to year-end.


	 


	On May 11, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 6,130,000 shares of our common stock to the owners of Global Boatworks, LLC for one hundred (100%) of its outstanding membership interests.





	As a result of our acquisition of Global Boatworks, LLC:













	 




	 




	 






	 




	·




	Global Boatworks, LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary,
















	 




	 




	 






	 




	·




	The officers and directors of Global Boatworks, LLC became our officers and directors,
















	 




	 




	 






	 




	·




	The shareholders of Global Boatworks, LLC became our shareholders, and

	Our principal executive office is located at 2637 Atlantic Blvd, #134, Pompano Beach, Florida 33062. Our telephone number is 954-934-9400. Our website is www.globalboatworks.com.







	Our auditors have included a going concern explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion, meaning that we face uncertainties that our business will not succeed or be viable. Additionally, it is likely that we will need additional capital or additional financing in the future, and if such financing is not available to us on acceptable terms our business may suffer or fail as a result.







	Operations







	 We plan to generate revenues from the sale of our vessels initially in South Florida and rental of a company owned vessel known as the Miss Leah located in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts which we rent on a short term basis. We have not yet generated revenues from the sale of vessels.


	 


	For the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $316,558 and $1,281,483 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, we had revenues of $31,714 and $37,072 respectively from short term rentals of our vessel in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts.


	 


	Our operations to date and those of Global Boatworks, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary include:


	 


	·


	development of our business plan;





	·


	acquisition of our company owned vessel, the Miss Leah;





	·


	locating designers for our Luxuria models;





	·


	completing the design of our Luxuria models;





	·


	identifying amenities to be offered with the Luxuria models;

	·


	renting the Miss Leah on a short term basis as a vacation rental.

	Our Company Owned Vessels







	On September 25, 2014, we purchased the Miss Leah, our company owned vessel from a related party. We use the Miss Leah as a short term rental property to generate revenue and demonstrate the upscale vessels we plan to offer.





	The Miss Leah was built in 2004 and fully renovated in 2011. The Miss Leah is a two (2) story vessel which is one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet under air, two (2) bedrooms, two (2) bathrooms, wood floors throughout, granite countertops, contemporary stainless steel appliances and a fireplace. The Miss Leah is docked at Marina Bay in Boston, Massachusetts. We rent the Miss Leah on a short term basis for between $200 and $400 per night.









	Luxuria Model




	 


	We plan to sell an upscale floating vessel known as the Luxuria model. We own the design but were assisted in our design of the Luxuria model by Carlos Vilaca & Associates and Double P Construction, Inc., who have decades of experience in South Florida design and construction.


	 


	Our Luxuria model takes between five (5) to seven (7) months to build and is approximately one thousand six hundred and fifty (1,650) square feet under air. The Luxuria model is designed to reflect South Floridas modern style. Luxuria can be equipped with either single or twin outboard motors and are intended to be docked. The Luxuria model will feature wood floors, marble countertops, modern stainless steel appliances and other upscale amenities.


	 


	We expect the Luxuria class vessel will retail for approximately $1,500,000 depending upon the amenities and specifications selected.


	 




	Distribution




	 


	We plan to distribute the Luxuria vessels through direct company sales to customers, boat dealerships, yacht brokers and real estate brokers.


	 




	Manufacturing




	 


	We do not have a written agreement with any manufacturer obligating them to manufacture our vessels. In the process of constructing Luxuria I we have found that there are suitable manufacturers who will be available on commercially reasonable terms as subcontractors to us.


	 


	Upon completion of manufacturing, we plan to dock our vessels in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We believe there are numerous marinas with dockage available on commercially reasonable terms.


	 




	Revenues




	 


	We will generate revenue from the rental of Miss Leah until it is sold and from the rental and sale of completed Luxuria model vessels. Upon completion of a Luxuria-class vessel, it will be used as a short term vacation rental until sold. We plan to dock the completed vessels at Bahia Mar Marina in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the vessel can be viewed and rented at a rate of approximately $1,000 per night, until sold.





	The Company has pledged the Miss Leah and Luxuria I and Luxuria II vessels as security for the repayment of certain notes. Therefore, the proceeds of such sales will first go to the repayment of the secured indebtedness.

	Target Customers




	 


	Our target customers are owners of marinas and other businesses and individuals seeking unique rental properties for their customers, corporations seeking a unique venue for company events and functions, persons seeking a vacation or second home on the water and individuals seeking to live on a floating vessel with the amenities commonly found in a home.



	 





	Marketing




	 


	We have implemented a marketing strategy. Primarily, part of our sales and marketing efforts will be to participate in boat shows and sales events at South Florida boating locations, typically held in January, February and March of each year. These shows and events are normally held at convention centers or marinas, with area boat distributors and dealers renting space and displaying product information for consumers. Boat shows and other offsite promotions will be an important venue for generating sales.





	We believe that a marketing strategy focused on boat shows and related events, social media, print advertising and internet advertising will provide potential customers with the opportunity to view our information about our vessels, which is an optimal strategy to increase sales.





	We market our rentals through Homeaway and Vacation Rentals By Owner (VRBO).







	Property







	We occupy dockage space pursuant to an agreement with Flagship Marina Bay, LLC dated April 7, 2015. We pay annual rents of approximately $14,000. The agreement automatically renews on November 15


	th


	of each year.





	We occupy approximately four hundred (400) square feet of office space without charge at the residence of Robert Rowe our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, and Leah Rowe, our Secretary.







	Research and Development







	We have not spent any amounts on research and development in the prior two (2) years. All research and development has been completed by Robert Rowe, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director.







	Government Regulation







	Our business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline, and diesel fuels. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing requirements for the use, management, handling, and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards.







	We do not believe we have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.






	7















	Employees







	As of December 31, 2015, we have the following employees:





	·


	Robert Rowe, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and Director who spends all his time on our business; and





	·


	Leah Rowe, our Secretary who spends between ten (10) to fifteen (15) hours per week on our business.





	We use the services of independent contractors on an as needed basis.





	None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We maintain good relationships with our employees.







	Material Agreements







	On February 2, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Carter, Terry and Company (Carter Terry), a FINRA registered broker-dealer for the purposes of securing financing. Pursuant thereto we were obligated to pay Carter Terry a fee upon the Company receiving financing based upon their introduction of a funding source. The fee consists a percentage of money raised and the issuance of common stock based upon the amount funded to the Company. The Company has entered into a termination agreement with Carter Terry as of March 22, 2017.





	Effective February 16, 2016, we entered into an agreement with StockVest, Inc., a Florida corporation that provides investor relations and public relations services. The agreement was amended on March 1, 2016. As amended StockVest agreed to provide us with services from March 12, 2016 until June 12, 2016, in exchange for $500 and one hundred fifty thousand (150,000) shares of our restricted common stock.  We valued these shares at the price of $.10 per share or an aggregate of $15,000.





	On August 4, 2016 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Tonaquint Inc., which provided for up to $610,000 in debt financing to the Company (inclusive of an original issue discount of $100,000). This agreement was amended on February 2, 2017 to extend the maturity date to May 11, 2017.





	On January 5, 2017 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with St George Investments, LLC, which provided for up to $830,000 in debt funding to the Company (inclusive of an original issue discount of $75,000).







	Dependence on a Few Customers







	We are not dependent on one (1) or a few customers and we do not expect to be so in the future.







	Product Liability







	The sale of vessels may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims. We could be included as a defendant in product liability claims relating to defects in manufacture or design of our vessels. We plan to require manufacturers of our vessels to carry and provide proof of product liability insurance. We also maintain third-party product liability insurance in the amount of $300,000 per occurrence, which may not be sufficient for claims against us. Additionally, we carry $300,000 of coverage, per occurrence, for damage to our company owed vessel. There can be no assurance that we will not experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage, or claims that are ultimately not covered by our insurance policy. If significant claims are made against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.








	8















	Competition







	We operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to facing competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition. We complete with single location boat dealers and, to a lesser degree, with national specialty marine stores, catalog retailers, sporting goods stores and mass merchants. Competition is based on the quality of available products, the price and value of the products and attention to customer service. There is significant competition in the markets which we plan to enter.





	Our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.







	Seasonality







	Our business, as well as the entire recreational boating industry, is highly seasonal. Generally, boat sales increase starting in January with the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in South Florida, and continue through March.





	Our business will be affected by weather patterns which may adversely impact our future operating results. For example, hurricanes in the South Florida area or reduced rainfall levels, as well as excessive rain, may render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations. The overall impact on our business from adverse weather conditions in any one (1) market area will continue to represent potential, material adverse risks to our financial performance.







	Intellectual Property







	We have not registered or patented any intellectual property. Trademarks and trade names distinguish companies from each other. If customers are unable to distinguish our products from those of other companies, we could lose sales to our competitors. We do not have any registered trademarks and trade names, so we only have common law rights with respect to infractions or infringements on its products. Many subtleties exist in product descriptions, offering and names that can easily confuse customers. The name of our principal products may be found in numerous variations of the name and descriptions in various media and product labels. This presents a risk of losing potential customers looking for our products and buying someone elses because they cannot differentiate between them.












	Legal Proceedings







	We are not a party to any legal proceedings.














	9























	 




	 







	ITEM 1A.






	RISK FACTORS.










	In addition to the information discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are important risks which could adversely affect our future results. If any of the risks we describe below materialize, or if any unforeseen risk




	develops, our operating results may suffer, our financial condition may deteriorate, the trading price of our common stock may decline and our investors could lose all or part of their investment.









	Risks Related to Our Financial Condition





	 




	There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our limited operating history and financial resources, and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.







	We incurred net losses of $316,558 and $1,281,483 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, respectively. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that we may be unable to continue as a going concern. Our limited operating history and financial resources raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our consolidated financial statements contain a going concern qualification.  Our consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.







	We are an early stage company with little or no historical performance for you to base an investment decision upon, and we may never become profitable.







	We are a recently formed company. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, we had revenues of $31,714 and $37,072 respectively. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2016, we have a net loss of $316,558 and $1,281,483 respectively. Accordingly, we have limited historical performance upon which you may evaluate our prospects for achieving our business objectives and becoming profitable in light of the risks, difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies such as us. Accordingly, before investing in our common stock, you should consider the challenges, expenses and difficulties that we will face as an early stage company, and whether we will ever become profitable.







	We are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations.







	We are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees.







	If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues for our operating expenses we will need financing, which we may be unable to obtain; should we fail to obtain sufficient financing, our revenues will be negatively impacted.







	Because we have limited revenues and lack historical financial data, including revenue data, our future revenues are unpredictable. Our operating expenses are approximately $12,500 per month or $150,000 annually. We will require $12,500 per month or $150,000 over the next twelve (12) months to meet our operational costs, which consist of rent, advertising, salaries and other general, administrative expenses to comply with the costs of being an SEC reporting company.





	We are obligated to repay outstanding indebtedness in excess of $1,600,000 during the next 12 months.








	10













	There is no assurance we will have sufficient funds available to implement our plan of operations which could cause you to lose your investment.





	Until we generate material operating revenues, we require additional debt or equity funding to continue our operations and implement our plan of operations. We intend to raise additional funds from an offering of our stock in the future; however, this offering may never occur, or if it occurs, we may be unable to raise the required funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding and we have no agreements for financing in place.







	Expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We recently became a publicly traded company.







	Operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance for legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that the cost of SEC reporting will be approximately $60,000 annually. Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. If we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly, annual reports and other required SEC reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a non-reporting issuer.








	Risks Related to Our Business










	Our business is subject to significant regulations which increase our operating costs; if we fail to comply with these regulations our operations will be negatively impacted.







	Our business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline, and diesel fuels. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing requirements for the use, management, handling, and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards.





	Regulatory approval processes may be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with these approvals or clearances could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.







	Our industry is highly competitive, and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our market share, financial condition and future growth.







	We operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to facing competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition. We compete with single location boat and yacht dealers and, to a lesser degree, with national specialty marine stores. Dealer competition is based on the quality of available products, the price and value of the products and attention to customer service. There is significant competition in the markets which we plan to enter.






	11













	Our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.







	Because Miss Leah, Luxuria I and Luxuria II, our company owned vessels are pledged as security for loans, if we default on the loans we would lose our primary assets and might not be able to continue our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment.







	On August 4, 2016 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Note with Tonaquint Inc., pursuant to which we pledged the Miss Leah as security for the Note. We are obligated to pay the entire principal and interest on May 11, 2017. The loan is secured by the Miss Leah, our company owned vessel. Because Miss Leah is our primary asset and is pledged as security for a loan, you could lose your investment if we default on the loan. Because of our limited revenues and weak financial condition, we may not be able to make the loan payment when due on May 11, 2017. This would cause us to lose our primary asset and we might not be able to implement our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment.





	On January 5, 2017 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Note with St George Investments, LLC, pursuant to which we pledged the Luxuria I and Luxuria II as security for the Note. We are obligated to pay the entire principal and interest on October 5, 2017. Because the Luxuria I and Luxuria II are primary assets and are pledged as security for a loan, you could lose your investment if we default on the loan. Because of our limited revenues and weak financial condition, we may not be able to make the loan payment when due on October 5, 2017. This would cause us to lose our primary assets and we might not be able to continue our business plan which could cause you to lose your entire investment.







	The purchase of our products is discretionary, and may be negatively impacted by adverse trends in the general economy and make it more difficult for us to generate revenues.







	Our business is affected by general economic conditions since our products are discretionary and we depend, to a significant extent, upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending. These factors include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers, employment rates, the level of consumers disposable income, business conditions, interest rates, consumer debt levels and availability of credit. Consumer spending on our products may be adversely affected by negative trends and changes in general economic conditions.







	The success of our business depends on our ability to market our Luxuria vessels effectively.







	Our ability to establish effective marketing and advertising campaigns is the key to our success. Our advertisements must effectively promote our corporate image, our Luxuria vessels and the pricing of such products. If we are unable to create awareness of our products, we may not be able to attract customers. Our marketing activities may not be successful in promoting the products we sell or pricing strategies or in retaining and increasing our customer base. We cannot assure you that our marketing programs will be adequate to create a demand for our products support our future growth, which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

	We may be subject to product liability claims and we do not have insurance coverage for such claims which could negatively impact our financial condition.




	 


	By selling boats, we will face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury or death. Also, in the event that any of the components of our vessels is defective, we may be required to recall or replace such components. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in the amount of $300,000 to protect us from such claims, which may not be sufficient coverage for claims against us. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would negatively impact our business and cause you to lose your investment.


	 




	We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to sell some of our products.




	 


	We have no secured intellectual property protection of the Global Boatworks or Luxuria names. Our industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for several companies. Third parties may assert claims of misappropriation of trade secrets or infringement of intellectual property rights against us for which we may be liable.


	 




	If our business expands, the number of products and competitors in our markets increases and product overlaps occur, infringement claims may increase in number and significance. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. Further, many potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources than we can to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing our products.


	 




	If we fail to develop the Global Boatworks and Luxuria brand, cost-effectively, our business may be adversely affected.




	 


	The success of our products marketed under the Global Boatworks and Luxuria brands will depend upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses incurred in building the brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business and results of operations could suffer.


	 





	Risks Related To Our Management







	 






	Should we lose the services of Robert Rowe, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, our financial condition and proposed expansion may be negatively impacted.




	 


	Our future depends on the continued contributions of Robert Rowe, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, who would be difficult to replace. Mr. Rowe is our only fulltime employee. Mr. Rowes services are critical to the management of our business and operations. We do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Rowe. Should we lose the services of Mr. Rowe, we may be unable to replace his services with equally competent and experienced personnel and our operational goals and strategies may be adversely affected, which will negatively affect our potential revenues.


	 






	13















	Certain officers and directors devote limited time to our business, which may negatively impact upon our plan of operations, implementation of our business plan and our potential profitability.




	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, Robert Rowe is our only full time employee. Leah Rowe, our Secretary spends approximately fifteen (15) hours per week on our business. The limited amount of full-time employees we employ may be inadequate to implement our plan of operations and develop a profitable business.


	 




	Our officers and directors have no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.




	 


	We have never operated as a public company and our management has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful.  We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.


	 







	We incur additional costs and management time related expenses pertaining to SEC reporting obligations and SEC compliance matter and our management has no experience in such matters.




	 


	Robert Rowe, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director is responsible for managing us, including compliance with SEC reporting obligations and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These public reporting requirements and controls are new to these individuals and at times will require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting or other professionals that will increase our costs of doing business.  Should we fail to comply with SEC reporting and internal controls and procedures, we may be subject to securities law violations that may result in additional compliance costs or costs associated with SEC judgments or fines, each of which would increase our costs and negatively affect our potential profitability and our ability to conduct our business.


	 




	Because we do not have an audit or compensation committee, shareholders will be required to rely on the members of our Board of Directors, who are not independent, to perform these functions.




	 


	We do not have an audit or compensation committee or Board of Directors as a whole that is composed of independent directors. Because our directors are also our officers and controlling shareholders, they are not independent. There is a potential conflict between their or our interests and our shareholders interests, since our directors are also our officers who will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. Until we have an audit or compensation committee or independent directors, there may be less oversight of management decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions, even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders.


	 






	14















	We are an "emerging growth company," and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.




	 


	We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act.  For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments, not previously approved.  We could be an emerging growth company for up to five (5) years, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1,000,000,000, if we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three (3) year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $100,000,000 as of any April 30th date before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following April 30th  We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.


	 


	We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.










	Risks Related to Our Common Stock





	 




	Our officers and directors have voting control over all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders, which will prevent our minority shareholders from having the ability to control any of our corporate actions.




	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we had 22,789,740 shares of common stock outstanding, each entitled to one vote per common share. Our Chief Executive Officer, President, Treasurer and Director, Robert Rowe, beneficially owns 14,370,000 common shares which represents approximately sixty-three percent (63%) of our outstanding shares. This entitles Mr. Rowe to control all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders. As a result, our management has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. Our managements control of our voting securities may make it impossible to complete some corporate transactions without its support and may prevent a change in our control. In addition, this ownership could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, possibly depressing the trading price of our common stock.


	 




	We will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.




	 


	The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. We anticipate that our common stock will be a penny stock, and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers.  For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common shares and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our common shares in the secondary market.






	15










	 


	For any transaction (other than an exempt transaction) involving a penny stock, the rules require delivery, prior to such transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made regarding sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities.


	 


	Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.


	 


	We do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock is exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.


	 




	Sales of our common stock under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock.




	 


	In general, persons holding restricted securities in a SEC reporting company, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than one percent (1%) of the total issued and outstanding shares in any ninety (90) day period, and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. If substantial amounts of our common stock become available for resale under Rule 144, prevailing market prices for our common stock will be reduced.









	We may, in the future, issue additional securities, which would reduce investors percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.




	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 90,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we had 22,789,740 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of Series A redeemable preferred shares outstanding. Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 67,210,260 shares of common stock and 9,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis including for services or acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our stockholders, and  might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. Our Board of Directors may designate the rights, terms and preferences of our authorized but unissued preferred shares at its discretion including conversion and voting preferences without notice to our shareholders.


	  




	Because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.






	 




	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after considering whether we have generated sufficient revenues, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and other factors. Accordingly, investors that are seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.


	 






	16















	As an issuer of penny stock the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us.






	 




	Although the federal securities law provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, if we are a penny stock we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 



	You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors.








	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION





	We were founded in June of 2014 to commercialize luxury living vessels. We plan to generate revenues from the sale of and rental of the vessels initially in South Florida. Our newly developed Luxuria model features a South Florida modern style, and is approximately one thousand six hundred fifty (1,650) square feet under air. The vessel offers amenities typically found in a luxury home.






	Year Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015






	Our revenues were $37,072 and $31,714 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our revenue for these two years is solely for the rental of the Miss Leah, based in Boston harbor.





	This represents a increase of approximately sixteen point nine percent (16.9%). This increase was most likely a result of our inability to rent the vessel in early 2015 because the very severe winter weather in Boston Massachusetts damaged the marina facilities, effectively cutting off both power  and water to the floating vessel until the marina was able to repair their utilities.





	Our cost of revenues consists of marina dockage fees and the fees of the online rental agency utilized by the Company to rent the Miss Leah and was $16,729 and $11,327 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  This represents an increase of approximately forty seven point seven percent (47.7%). This increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in marina fees. Our cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues was approximately forty five point one (45.1%) and thirty five point seven percent (35.7%) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Again, this increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in marina fees.





	Our gross margin was $20,343 and $20,387 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	Our general and administrative expenses were $283,731 and $129,379 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for an increase of $154,352 or an increase of one hundred nineteen point three percent (119.3%). General and administrative expenses are principally composed of officer salaries, professional fees, insurance, office supplies repairs and maintenance, management fees and travel. The primary increase was officer salaries and amortization of prepaid services.






	19













	Our professional fees were $217,695 and $183,529 for the year ended December 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $34,166 or eighteen point six percent (18.6%). This increase is the result of increased audit and legal fees due to being an SEC fully reporting company.





	Our interest expense was $479,218 and $24,037 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $455,181 or eighteen hundred ninety three point seven percent (1,893.7%). This increase is due to the interest expense accrued on the note payable to affiliate for the acquisition of the vessel and the amortization of prepaid interest, loan fee and loan discount on the short term loan received in July 2015 and Original Issue Discount (OID) and loan discounts on the short term loan received in August 2016.





	Our derivative expense was $223,096 and change in fair value of derivative was $98,089 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and zero for the year ended December 31, 2015.





	We recorded a net loss of ($1,281,483) and ($316,558) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.








	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	Cash Flow Activities






	 Our cash decreased ($36,968) and increased $43,817 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease is principally the result of cash investments of $119,500, and $492,000 short term loan proceeds less $579,668 operating cash flows.





	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $10,511 for our operational needs. Currently, our operating expenses are approximately $12,500 per month. We are obligated to repay an outstanding loan in one lump payment in the amount of $100,000 on July 15, 2017 and a second one in one lump payment in the amount of $610,000 on May 11, 2017. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds to meet our monthly operating costs we would have available cash for our operating needs for approximately one (1) month before repayment of the $610,000 due on May 11, 2017 and the $100,000 due on July 15, 2017.






	Investing Activities






	During the year ended December 31, 2016 we made a non-interest bearing short term loan of $50,000 to a significant consultant who is also a stockholder.






	Financing Activities






	During the year ended December 31, 2016 we funded our working capital needs primarily from cash flow from operations, the sale of common stock with proceeds of $119,500 and a short term loan from a third party with net proceeds of $492,000. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we funded our working capital needs from cash flow from operations, the sale of common stock with proceeds of $157,000 and a short term loan from a third party with proceeds of $135,000.






	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:






	20














	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, payables and accrued expenses. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.






	Revenue







	Rental Revenue

	Revenue is recognized when earned, generally starting when the rental customer takes temporary possession of the floating vessel and through their contracted stay. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Cost of Revenue includes the marina dockage fees and fees charged by the web site Homeaway, where the floating vessel is advertised for rent.






	Sale Revenue

	 Revenue is recognized when earned, generally at closing of the sale of a vessel. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Cost of Revenue includes the capitalized cost of constructing a vessel.






	Construction in progress






	Costs to construct vessels are capitalized during the construction phase. Upon completion of a vessel the Company will either sell the vessel or place in it service as a rental property. If the vessel is to be leased the construction costs are transferred to property and equipment and depreciated over its useful life.






	Property and Equipment






	Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.






	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets






	We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	(See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 3 of Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements.)

	Plan of Operations






	Historically, we generated revenue from the short-term vacation rental of the Miss Leah, a company owned vessel located in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts. At present, we expect to generate revenue from this vessel as a short-term vacation rental in the future. We listed this vessel for sale in June of 2015.





	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $10,511 for our operational needs. Currently, our operating expenses are approximately $12,500 per month. We are obligated to repay an outstanding loan in one lump payment in the amount of $100,000 on July 15, 2017 and a second one in one lump payment in the amount of $610,000 on May 11, 2017. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds to meet our monthly operating costs we would have available cash for our operating needs for approximately one (1) months before repayment of the $610,000 due on May 11, 2017 and the $100,000 due on July 15, 2017.





	We are focusing our efforts on commercializing luxury stationary vessels designed in a South Florida modern style. We completed the design of the Luxuria model in the first quarter of 2015. Luxuria will be approximately one thousand six hundred fifty (1,650) square feet, with two (2) bedrooms and bathrooms, and sleeps up to six (6) people. We began construction of Luxuria I in March 2016 and it is substantially complete in March 2017. We have begun negotiating for the construction of the barge bottom for Luxuria II.





	We plan to use the Luxuria models as a short-term vacation rental property in South Florida and for outright sale. We believe that using the Luxuria as a short-term vacation rental in South Florida could provide a year round source of cash flow and a model for future custom build orders.





	While rental of the Miss Leah presently and Luxuria in the future, are expected to provide a relatively steady revenue stream to us, the construction and sale of custom designed and built luxury floating vessels are expected to generate significantly greater revenues and potential profits.





	As of December 2016, we have expended $431,501 for the construction of Luxuria I, of which $70,000 was a non-cash payment in common stock of the Company.





	We anticipate that construction of each vessel will take between five (5) to seven (7) months, per vessel once we begin Luxuria II, as Luxuria I had delays due to various unforseen circumstances and changes needed during the process of construction. We will require additional funds to develop and carry out our future plans including construction of our third vessel. We have secured funding for the construction of Luxuria II. We begin marketing each vessel when manufacturing commences.





	Our first Luxuria barge bottom was delivered to us in late February 2016. We issued 425,000 shares of our common stock as payment for this barge bottom to a former officer and director who constructed it, valued at $70,000, or $0.16 per share, under an agreement dated September 14, 2016, at which time the market price of the stock was $0.23 per share. This party has not accepted the stock certificate and recently informed the Company that they want to renegotiate since the market price of the common stock has fallen to $0.08 per share.





	Our independent registered public accountant has included a going concern explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion for the periods through December 31, 2016 and 2015. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the twelve (12) months after the issuance of this report.





	Our company owned vessel, the Miss Leah, is listed for sale at the price of $379,000. If sold, the Company is required to pay $200,000 to the creditor holding the $610,000 note at closing.  The retail price of the Luxuria is approximately $1,500,000. The sale of the Luxuria I vessel would provide sufficient capital to construct two more Luxuria models.






	22













	Until such time as the Miss Leah is sold, we will continue to rent the vessel on a short term basis. We plan to market the Luxuria models to yacht brokers, real estate brokers and boat dealerships.





	On August 11, 2016, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured convertible promissory note for $610,000, the Company drew $305,000 and received $227,500 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. On October 5, 2016, pursuant to this securities purchase agreement and secured convertible promissory note, the Company drew $122,000 and received $92,000 in cash and on November 3, 2016, the Company drew $183,000 and received $150,000 in cash   This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Miss Leah and the Luxuria 1, and the member interests of its wholly owned LLC. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $100,000 and is proportional to the total amount borrowed. An OID of $50,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the initial draw, $20,000 for the second draw and $30,000 for the third draw and is being amortized over the remaining portion of the six month life of the note. In addition, the Company is required to pay $10,000 of the lenders legal fees (pro rata to the draws) and $30,500 of brokerage commission which was withheld from the initial $305,000 draw and the $122,000 second draw, both of which were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the six month life of the note. Also, the Company was required to issue 100,000 shares of restricted common stock which were valued at $0.10 per share based on then recent stock sales and recorded as a discount to the note and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. This note requires a $200,000 partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Miss Leah. The note is personally guaranteed by the Companys CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.





	The lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a 

	Conversion

	) all or any part of the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance into shares (

	Conversion Shares

	) of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (

	Common Stock

	), of Company as per the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the 

	Conversion Amount

	) divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below). All Conversions shall be cash-less and not require further payment from Lender.





	Subject to the adjustments set forth in the agreement, the conversion price (the 

	Conversion Price

	) for each Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the 

	Conversion Factor

	) multiplied by the lowest Closing Bid Price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally, if at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance on the Maturity Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Major Default.

	On January 5, 2017, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured promissory note for $830,000 available in five tranches, the Company drew $170,000 and received $150,000 in cash net of $15,000 OID and $5,000 legal fees under this nine month secured promissory note. On March 9, 2017, the Company drew $110,000 and received $100,000 in cash net of $10,000 OID under this nine month secured promissory note.  This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Luxuria I and the Luxuria II, the member interests of its wholly owned LLC and personally guaranteed by Robert Rowe, CEO of the Company. The lenders security interests are subordinate to the security interests of the August 11, 2016 lender. This note is structured in multiple parts, first the initial $170,000 as drawn and a subsequent $660,000 which can be drawn at the Companys option in tranches. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, (except in event of default as defined in the promissory note), but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $75,000 and is pro-rata on each tranche drawn. The OID will be amortized over the remaining life of the note from the date drawn. In addition, the Company is required to pay $5,000 of the lenders legal fees which was applied to the first tranche drawn, which will also be recorded as debt discount and will be amortized over the nine month life of the note.





	This note requires a partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Luxuria I and Luxuria II, upon the receipt of which the lender has agreed to release the security interest in the related vessel. This prepayment is 10% of the profits on the Luxuria I and 33% of the profits on the Luxuria II. If the Company rents/leases either the Luxuria I or II, then the prepayment is 20% of the gross rental profit. The note is personally guaranteed by the Companys CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note carries an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm






	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of:


	Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc.





	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,281,483 and net cash used in operations of $579,668 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company has an accumulated deficit and stockholders deficit of $1,604,911 and $515,517, respectively at December 31, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Managements Plan in regards to these matters is also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	F-6








	Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc.




	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016


	and 2015






	(1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS





	Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc., (the Company, Global Boatworks), was formed on May 11, 2015, under the laws of the State of Florida. At formation the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Global Boatworks, LLC, (LLC) which was formed on June 16, 2014, under the laws of the State of Florida.  The Companys business activities to date have primarily consisted of the formation and implementation of a business plan for building luxury floating vessels on a barge bottom, the rental activities relating to the existing vessel, Miss Leah, and the construction of the new vessel, Luxuria I. On September 25, 2014, effective the close of business September 24, 2014, the Company acquired a luxury floating vessel from Financial Innovators Corp., (Predecessor or Financial Innovators), and operates it as a rental property, based in Boston harbor.





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the activities of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. and  Global Boatworks, LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary.





	(2) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION, USE OF ESTIMATES


	AND GOING CONCERN






	a) Principles of Consolidation



	The comparative figures shown throughout these consolidated financial statements are the historical results of Global Boatworks Holdings, Inc. inclusive of its wholly owned subsidiary Global Boatworks, LLC. The Company has retroactively restated amounts within certain components of Stockholders' Deficit on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to account for the acquisition and reorganization of Global Boatworks, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.






	b) Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


	Significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements involved the valuation of construction in progress, depreciable life of the floating vessel, valuation of long lived assets, valuation of derivatives, valuation of common and preferred stock issued as compensation and valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets.






	c) Going Concern






	The accompanying  financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  It is managements opinion that the Companys financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, as reflected by the accumulated deficit and stockholders deficit of $1,604,911 and $515,517 at December 31, 2016. In addition the Company had a net loss of $1,281,483 and used cash of $579,668 in operating activities in 2016. The Company is expected to have increasing costs and expenses as a result of becoming a publicly held company and constructing new vessels without immediate increases in revenues as they continue to implement their plan of operations. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon increasing operations, developing sales and obtaining additional capital and financing. The Company is seeking to raise sufficient equity capital to enable it to pay off existing debt. It is also attempting to sell the Miss Leah and the first luxury floating vessel it currently owns.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016




	and 2015






	(3) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	a) Cash and cash equivalents






	The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. We had no financial instruments that qualified as cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 or 2015.






	b) Construction in progress






	Costs to construct vessels are capitalized during the construction phase. Upon completion of a vessel the Company will either sell the vessel or place it in service as a rental property. If the vessel is to be leased, the construction costs are transferred to property and equipment and depreciated over its useful life.





	     



	c) Property and equipment






	All property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method.  Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is  included in the results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred.






	d) Impairment of long-lived assets






	A long-lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from its use and eventual disposition. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived assets exceeds its fair value.






	e)


	Financial instruments and Fair value measurements






	ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments, allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.





	ASC 825 also requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. The carrying value of the Companys current financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair values because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.





	FASB ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. It also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:

	e)


	Financial instruments and Fair value measurements

	(continued)





	Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


	Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.


	Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.





	The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.





	The following is the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015, using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

	780,685










	f) Revenue recognition







	Rental Revenue

	Revenue is recognized when earned, generally starting when the rental customer takes temporary possession of the floating vessel and through their contracted stay. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Cost of Revenue includes the marina dockage fees and fees charged by the web site Homeaway, where the floating vessel is advertised for rent.






	Sale Revenue

	 Revenue is recognized when earned, generally at closing of the sale of a vessel. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with ASC 605-45. Cost of Revenue includes the capitalized cost of constructing a vessel.






	g)


	Stock compensation for services rendered






	Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the shorter of period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award or the vesting period. The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.

	g)


	Stock compensation for services rendered

	(continued)





	Pursuant to ASC 505-50, for share-based payments to non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date. The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.






	h)


	Income Taxes






	The LLC and the predecessor company, (Financial Innovators), are pass through entities for income tax purposes, therefore there is no income tax provision or liability for these entities through the Companys incorporation date of May 11, 2015. As a result of the reorganization the Company became a taxable entity on May 11, 2015. Upon becoming a taxable entity, the Company began to use the asset and liability method of ASC 740 to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that, based on available evidence, is more likely than not to be realized.





	The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.





	The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.





	As of December 31, 2016, the tax years 2016, 2015 and 2014 for the LLC and 2016 and 2015 for the corporation remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit or any notifications from the IRS for any of the open tax years.






	i) Convertible Notes With Fixed Rate Conversion Features






	The Company may issue convertible notes, which are convertible into common shares at a fixed discount to the price of the common stock at the time of conversion. The Company measures the fair value of the note at the time of issuance at the fixed monetary value of the payable and records any premium as interest expense on the issuance date.

	j) Debt issue costs






	The Company accounts for debt issuance cost paid to lenders, or third parties. The costs associated with the issuance of debt are recorded as debt discount and amortized over the life of the underlying debt instrument.






	k) Net income (loss) per share






	Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing the loss attributable to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the Company.  Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the loss available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period and dilutive potential shares outstanding unless consideration of such dilutive potential shares would result in anti-dilution. There were 16,511,370 and zero common stock equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015, respectively.






	l) Derivatives






	The Company evaluates its convertible debt, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The result of this accounting treatment is that under certain circumstances the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a convertible note containing an embedded derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and that fair value is reclassified to equity.  The shares issued upon conversion of the note are recorded at their fair value with gain or loss recognition as applicable.





	Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

	Recent accounting pronouncements






	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time based on when control of goods and services transfer to a customer. As a result, we do not expect significant changes in the presentation of our financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and entities are permitted to apply either prospectively or retrospectively; early adoption is permitted.





	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.

	(3) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)






	m)


	Recent accounting pronouncements

	(continued)





	As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and entities are permitted to apply either prospectively or retrospectively; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.





	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new standard principally affects accounting standards for equity investments, financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Upon the effective date of the new standards, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities, other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification and therefore, no changes in fair value will be reported in other comprehensive income for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. The new guidance on the classification and measurement will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.





	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

	(5) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT (continued)





	On September 25, 2014, the Company acquired the Miss Leah, a two story luxury floating vessel in the Cape Cod architectural style built on a barge platform. The Miss Leah is based at a marina in Boston harbor. It is rented out primarily through a third party rental management company on a short term vacation type basis. The Miss Leah was built in 2004 by  the founder of the Company and subsequently sold in 2006 to his brother who established the Predecessors rental business.  Due to the related party relationship between the Company and the Predecessor the luxury floating vessel was recorded on the Companys books at its original cost basis of $0 based on its fully depreciated value at the transfer date.





	The Company capitalized the costs of developing the architectural plans for the Luxuria model floating vessel and has begun amortizing the costs over their estimated useful life of seven years, beginning April 1, 2016. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $1,368.





	(6) RENTAL PROPERTY AND RELATED NOTE  PAYABLE





	On September 25, 2014, the Company acquired the Miss Leah, a two story luxury floating vessel in the Cape Cod architectural style built on a barge platform. The Miss Leah is based at a marina in Boston harbor. It is rented out primarily through a third party rental management company on a short term vacation type basis. The Miss Leah was built in 2004 by  the founder of the Company and subsequently sold in 2006 to his brother who established the Predecessors rental business.





	The terms of this acquisition are for a payable to the related party Predecessor in the amount of $100,000, carrying interest at 2% per annum from the effective date of the transfer date of September 25, 2014 with all principal and interest due on the maturity date of June 20, 2022, which was memorialized in the form of a promissory note in June 2015, effective September 25, 2014. Due to the related party relationship between the Company and the Predecessor the luxury floating vessel was recorded on the Companys books at its original cost basis of $0 based on its fully depreciated value at the transfer date. Accordingly, the Company charged additional paid-in capital as a distribution for $100,000. Outstanding principal and interest totaled $104,482 at December 31, 2016.





	(7) SHORT TERM LOAN AND SHORT TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE






	a) Short term note






	On July 9, 2015, the company entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $151,700 with a shareholder. The company issued 250,000 common shares to the shareholder as consideration for providing us the loan. The shares were valued at $25,000, or $0.10 per share (based on the recent private placement sales) was recorded as a discount and is being amortized at a rate of $2,083 per month over the life of the loan. The note bears interest at the rate of 10%. Prepaid interest in the amount of $15,000 and a loan fee of $1,700 were deducted from the proceeds of the loan. These were amortized each month at the rate of $1,250 and $142 over the life of the loan, respectively. We were obligated to pay the principal and interest due on July 9, 2016. The loan was secured by the Miss Leah, our company owned vessel. The Company paid $6,000 in interest to the holder during the third quarter 2016.





	The note holder sold $51,700 of this note to a third party in August 2016, and the Company modified the new $51,700 note to add a conversion feature at a conversion rate of 60% of the trading price of the

	Companys common stock. This note is considered stock settled debt and accordingly the Company  recorded a premium on the debt of $34,467 as a charge to interest expense on the modification date. This third party converted $51,700 of this in exchange for 1,574,740 shares in August and the fourth quarter 2016, and the premium was reclassified to additional paid in capital.





	The $100,000 remaining balance of the original note was renegotiated into a new note on December 5, 2016 which matures on July 15, 2017. This new note carries interest at a rate of 16.8% which is payable in cash monthly. The Company paid $4,200 in interest during the fourth quarter 2016.

	On August 11, 2016, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured convertible promissory note for $610,000, the Company drew $305,000 and received $227,500 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Miss Leah and the Luxuria 1, and the member interests of its wholly owned LLC. This note is structured in two parts, first the initial $305,000 as drawn and a subsequent $305,000 which can be drawn at the Companys option in amount/s determined by the Company. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $100,000 and is proportional to the total amount borrowed. An OID of $50,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the initial draw and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. In addition, the Company is required to pay $10,000 of the lenders legal fees (pro rata to the draws) and $22,500 of brokerage commission which was withheld from the initial $305,000 draw, both of which were also recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the six month life of the note. Also, the Company is required to issue 100,000 shares of restricted common stock which was valued at $0.10 per share based on recent stock sales and recorded as a discount to the note and is being amortized over the six month life of the note. This note requires a $200,000 partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Miss Leah. The note is personally guaranteed by the Companys CEO, Robert Rowe. In event of default the note carries an interest rate equal to the lesser of 22% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.





	On October 5, 2016, the Company drew an additional $122,000 and received $92,000 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. An OID of $20,000 was recorded as a discount to the note for the second draw and is being amortized over the remaining life of the note. Brokerage commission of $8,000 and $2,000 of the legal costs, were paid from this draw and recorded as debt discounts and are being amortized over the remaining life of the note. On November 3, 2016, the Company drew an additional $183,000 and received $150,000 in cash under this six month secured convertible promissory note. An OID of $30,000 and $3,000 of legal costs were recorded as discounts to the note for the third draw and are being amortized over the remaining life of the note.

	(7) SHORT TERM LOAN AND SHORT TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE (continued)






	b) Short term convertible note

	(continued)





	The total note is convertible into common stock upon an event of default as follows:





	Lender has the right at any time following an Event of Default, at its election, to convert (each instance of conversion is referred to herein as a Conversion) all or any part of the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance into shares (Conversion Shares) of fully paid and non-assessable common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (Common Stock), of Company as per the following conversion formula: the number of Conversion Shares equals the amount being converted (the Conversion Amount) divided by the Conversion Price (as defined below).





	Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price (the Conversion Price) for each Conversion shall be equal to 60% (the Conversion Factor) multiplied by the lowest Closing Bid Price in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion. Additionally, if at any time after the Effective Date, the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future Conversions. Finally, in addition to the Default Effect, if any Major Default occurs after the Effective Date (other than an Event of Default for failure to pay the Conversion Eligible Outstanding Balance on the Maturity Date), the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future Conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur after the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each occurrence of any Major Default shall be deemed to be a separate occurrence for purposes of the foregoing reductions in Conversion Factor, even if the same Major Default occurs three (3) separate times). For example, the first time the Conversion Shares are not DTC Eligible, the Conversion Factor for future Conversions thereafter will be reduced from 60% to 55% for purposes of this example. If, thereafter, there are three (3) separate occurrences of a Major Default pursuant to Section 4.1(a), then for purposes of this example the Conversion Factor would be reduced by 5% for the first such occurrence, and so on for each of the second and third occurrences of such Major Default.





	Due to the variable conversion terms and certain default provisions, the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and recorded as a derivative liability at an initial fair value of $378,624 with $217,500 recorded as a debt discount and $161,124 as a derivative expense. The October 5, 2016 draw resulted in an initial fair value of $113,616 with $92,000 recorded as a debt discount and $21,616 as a derivative expense.  The November 3, 2016 draw resulted in an initial fair value of $190,356 with $150,000 recorded as a debt discount and $40,356 as a derivative expense. The valuation method utilized was the Black-Scholes model with the following range of assumptions: Expected life in years 0.5 to 0.10; conversion price range of $0.21 to $0.036; Bond equivalent yield rate between 0.29% and 0.63% and volatility ranging from 240% to 277%.

	(11) - INCOME TAXES (continued)





	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effects of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities.





	The components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities that have been presented in the Company's financial statements are as follows at December 31,:













	Deferred income tax assets:

	$


	- 









	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, an assessment of all available evidence both positive and negative was required. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $374,365 and  $82,785 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	At December 31, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $994,859 available to offset future net income expiring through 2036. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforward is dependent on the ability of the Company to generate sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period. In the event that a significant change in ownership of the Company occurs as a result of the issuance of common stock, the utilization of the NOL carry forward will be subject to limitation under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Management does not presently believe that such a change has occurred.





	In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740: Income Taxes, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2016, the Company has no liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The Company continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.





	As of December 31, 2016, the tax years 2016, 2015 and 2014 for the LLC and 2016 and 2015 for the corporation remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit or any notifications from the IRS for any of the open tax years.





	(12) CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK





	The Company has only one revenue producing asset at this time, the Miss Leah floating vessel, and that asset is located in Boston Harbor. The rental season at this location is generally from March through October. The Company primarily utilizes one booking agent to schedule bookings from customers and collect the revenue. If required the Company believes it could obtain bookings through an alternative provider.





	The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which may, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company had no cash balances in excess of FDIC insured limits at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	(13) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	a) Short Term Debt






	On January 5, 2017, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and a secured promissory note for $830,000 available in five tranches, the Company drew $170,000 and received $150,000 in cash net of $15,000 OID and $5,000 legal fees under this nine month secured promissory note. This note is secured by all the assets of the Company, inclusive of the Luxuria I and the Luxuria II, the member interests of its wholly owned LLC and personally guaranteed by Robert Rowe, CEO of the Company. The lenders security interests are subordinate by law to the security interests of the August 11, 2016 lender.  This note is structured in multiple parts, first the initial $170,000 as drawn and a subsequent $660,000 which can be drawn at the Companys option. This note does not carry a stated interest rate, (except it is 22% in event of default as defined in the promissory note), but carries an Original Issue Discount (OID) that totals $75,000 and is pro-rata on each tranche drawn. The OID will be amortized over the remaining life of the note from the date drawn. In addition, the Company is required to pay $5,000 of the lenders legal fees which was applied to the first tranche drawn which will also be recorded as debt discount and will be amortized over the nine month life of the note. The Company received the second tranche of $110,000 and received $100,000 in cash net of $10,000 OID under this note in March 2017.





	This note requires a partial prepayment if and when the Company sells the Luxuria I and Luxuria II, upon the receipt of which the lender has agreed to release the security interest in the vessels. This prepayment is 10% of the profits on the Luxuria I and 33% of the profits on the Luxuria II. If the Company rents/leases either the Luxuria I or II, then the prepayment is 20% of the gross rental revenue.






	b)  Short Term Convertible Note






	On February 2, 2017, the lender agreed to extend the maturity of the August 11, 2016 Note from February 11, 2017 to May 11, 2017, in exchange for additional interest of $18,300 due at maturity.






	c) Common Stock Issuances






	In January 2017, the Company issued 100,000 shares of common stock under a December 5, 2016, promissory note amendment, (see Note 7a), valued at $0.15 per share based on quoted trading price, or a total of $15,000.





	In January 2017, the Company issued 1,100,000 shares of common stock under a December 1, 2016, consulting agreement, valued at measurement dates to be determined. This agreement obligates the Company to also issue 1,000,000 shares on July 1, 2017 and 1,000,000 shares on January 1, 2018.





	In January 2017, the Company issued 200,000 vested shares of common stock under a January 18, 2017, consulting agreement, valued at $0.08 per share based on quoted trading price on agreement date, or a total of $16,000.





	In January 2017, the Company issued 250,000 vested shares of common stock under a January 23, 2017, consulting agreement, valued at $0.135 per share based on quoted trading price on agreement date, or a total of $33,750. This agreement obligates the Company to also issue 250,000 shares on March 9, 2017

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13(a)-15(b) under the Exchange Act, as the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.





	Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.







	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.







	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.


	 




	Limitations of Effectiveness of Control and Procedures




	 


	In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

	Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm






	The Board of Directors policy is to pre-approve, typically at the beginning of our fiscal year, all audit and non-audit services, other than de minimis non-audit services, to be provided by an independent registered public accounting firm.  These services may include, among others, audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services and such services are generally subject to a specific budget.  The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full Board of Directors regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date.  As part of the Boards review, the Board will evaluate other known potential engagements of the independent auditor, including the scope of work proposed to be performed and the proposed fees, and approve or reject each service, taking into account whether the services are permissible under applicable law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the independent auditors independence from management.  At audit committee meetings throughout the year, the auditor and management may present subsequent services for approval.  Typically, these would be services such as due diligence for an acquisition, that would not have been known at the beginning of the year.





	The Board of Directors has considered the provision of non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm to be compatible with maintaining their independence.  The audit committee will continue to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.

We will not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by selling
shareholders.


We operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to facing
competition generally from businesses seeking to attract discretionary spending
dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting
in intense competition. We complete with single location boat dealers and, to a
lesser degree, with national specialty marine stores, catalog retailers,
sporting goods stores and mass merchants. Competition is based on the quality of
available products, the price and value of the products and attention to
customer service. There is significant competition in the markets which we plan
to enter. 

Our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially
greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future
competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results and financial condition.


Company Description
We are a development-stage company, incorporated in the state of Florida on May
11, 2015, to acquire our wholly owned subsidiary Global Boatworks, LLC, a
Florida limited liability company formed on June 16, 2014, to commercialize
upscale floating vessels built on a barge bottom. We own one floating


 vessel,
the Miss Leah, which we acquired from a related party on September 25, 2014, as
a prototype and to operate as a short term rental in Boston Harbor,
Massachusetts.
---

Our operations to date and those of Global Boatworks, LLC, our wholly owned
subsidiary include: 

· development of our business plan;

· acquisition of our company owned vessel, the Miss Leah;

· locating designers for our Luxuria models;

· completing the design of our Luxuria models;

· identifying amenities to be offered with the Luxuria models;

· selecting Lauderdale Marine Center as the manufacturer of the Luxuria models;

· developing marketing strategies;

· marketing the short term rental of the Miss Leah on Home Away and Vacation
  Rentals By Owner (VRBO);and

· renting the Miss Leah on a short term basis as a vacation rental.
---

Our principal executive office is located at 2637 Atlantic Blvd, #134, Pompano

Vessel to 
add over $1M in Asset Value with Sales Price Expected at $1.5M; $1,000-1500 per 
day as a Rental



POMPANO BEACH, FL—Nov 29, 2016 – Global Boatworks Holdings 
(OTC: GBBT) 
announced the following update today:

Construction of the Luxuria - The "Luxuria" is currently under construction at 
the Lauderdale Marine Center in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The total square footage of 
the complete vessel will be 1966 feet. The hull as well as both floors are 
framed out. As of our latest production schedule, completion dates for 
individual milestones are as follows:

Interior doors and hardware completion by end of first week in December. 
Cabinets and electrical work to be completed by the end of the third week of 
December. Decks and railing first week in January, 2017. Flooring, glass and 
tile work to be complete by mid-January.

Engines for the Luxuria will be installed last which is slated to occur 25 
January, 2017.

Completion and Documentation is expected to occur on or before 26th January, 
2017.

Sales and Rentals of the Luxuria Class Vessels - Sales price of the Luxuria 
class luxury floating vessels will be in the $1.5 million range. The units are 
expected to rent for $1,000-1,500 per night. Each vessel will have 1,600 square 
feet of air-conditioned luxury living space and amenities which is far greater 
than comparable hotel rooms, which rent for the same price in the local area. 
Rates will be higher for special event occasions and holidays as well as a 
higher rate for the winter months.

Bob Rowe, CEO of Global Boatworks stated, “We are pleased to be on track for 
completion of our first Luxuria class luxury living vessel by late January.”

Rowe continued, “The Luxuria will enable us to add over one million dollars in 
asset value and at the same time, we expect it to be more than just an asset on 
the books; it will be an income producer. The sale of the Miss Leah, in Boston 
will enable us to get a running start on construction of the second Luxuria 
class vessel.”

The Luxuria is the first of two flagship and showcase vessels to be constructed 
in South Florida. The Luxuria class vessels feature: Floor-to-ceiling windows; a 
chef-quality kitchen; two bedrooms with a spacious master suite; spa-like 
bathrooms; big-screen TV; two large decks; and two outboard engines. These will 
be docked in the exclusive marinas in South Florida and offered for sale and 
short-term rentals for vacationers, business travelers, and special events.

Sale of the Miss Leah - Additionally, the Company has a contract for sale of the 
“Miss Leah” in Boston, MA. Proceeds from the sale, if executed, will be used to 
reduce short term debt and reinvested into the Company to provide additional 
capital for construction the second Luxuria class luxury floating vessel.

About the Miss Leah - The Miss Leah is a two story, private townhouse, updated 
with top-of-the-line amenities and features. Located right in the heart of 
Quincy's most desirable community, Marina Bay. The Miss Leah has a view across 
the Boston Harbor and amazing views of the city of Boston. The Boardwalk is full 
of restaurants, and nightlife and is only a 10-15 minute drive from downtown

About Global Boatworks Holdings:

CAbout:

are literally luxury homes that float. They have stainless steel appliances, 
granite counter tops, fireplaces, roman tubs, floor to ceiling windows, electric 
blinds, heated towel racks, etc. The Luxuria Floating vessel is a true luxury 
home that just happens to float.

Global Boatworks, LLC intends to be the Premier Builder of Luxury Floating 
Vessels in the Southeastern United States.
Keys to Success
- Obtain capital to fund operations
- Complete build-out of flagship Luxuria models in timely manner
- Leverage experience of owners with proven track record of success in 
construction and business development
- Utilizing a highly experienced project team with design-build skills
- Creating robust marketing programs to target the hospitality and boating 
markets
- Staying relevant to vacationers and boat buyers with continued product 
enhancements
- Managing internal finances and cash flow to facilitate upward capital growth

The majestic waterways and unparalleled sunny days of Florida are enough to 
entice anyone to move to the Sunshine State. Many companies have relocated to 
Florida, especially if their business growth is dependent on warm weather and an 
abundance of rivers and oceanfront properties. These conditions became a 
necessity for Global Boatworks, LLC, who were in the process of developing 
floating vessels for residential and commercial use in Boston, MA. The first 
model, Miss Leah, was successfully launched in Boston Harbor to become the first 
of its kind as a Flotel or Floating Hotel in the State.

While the success of Miss Leah prompted the developer, Robert Rowe, to continue 
with the plans, the weather related seasonal limitation of Massachusetts 
resulted in moving the future projects to sunny Florida.

In the past, Mr. Rowe has founded and operated multiple highly successful 
construction firms in Massachusetts, working on several high-end projects. He 
has also worked as an independent construction consultant in Boston and South 
Florida for the past several years. In 2014 the Global Boatworks, LLC was 
established in South Florida and released the plans for their newest model, 
Luxuria.

Global Boatworks, LLC (“the Company”) is a multifaceted boat-building and 
vacation-rental company that operates out of Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company 
has previously built a highly successful rental houseboat in Boston, and 
currently has designed a state-of-the-art luxury floating home that will launch 
in the South Florida market. Global Boatworks will immediately build two 
flagship showcase models of its modern “Luxuria” floating home, which features: 
Floor-to-ceiling windows; a chef-quality kitchen; spacious bedrooms; spa-like 
bathrooms; big-screen TV; two large decks; and two outboard engines.

They will be docked in the exclusive marinas in South Florida and offered for 
sale and short-term rentals for vacationers, business travelers, and special 
events.

Our Homes:
Global Boatworks will build a series of luxury houseboats for rental, floatels 
in South Florida. These floating vessels will be marketed to vacationers as a 
one-of-a-kind rental experience, moored in high-end marinas with 360-degree 
views of the ocean and the skyline of cities like West Palm Beach, Fort 
Lauderdale, and Miami Beach, etc.

luxuryhomesGlobal Boatworks’ “Luxuria” houseboats will be modern, luxury-filled 
designs based on a working model from the Company’s co-owner in Boston. The 
floating vessel, floatel has had great success as a vacation rental on the 
Boston Harbor, and these new vessels will take advantage of the year-round 
beautiful weather in South Florida to bring in a steady stream of rental income.

The Company intends to immediately build two Luxuria models and also field 
orders for custom houseboats. Each Luxuria will have a two-story townhouse 
design with top-of-the-line amenities and features. The richly appointed 
interior will be approximately 1,400 square feet with two bedrooms and two 
baths, sleeping 5-6 
guests. 
Air conditioning, a master bedroom with Jacuzzi, and washer/dryer will be 
standard. The features will also include:

Floor-to-ceiling glass
Stainless steel appliances
Granite countertops
Motorized shades
Pop-up big screen TV
Roman tubs
Luxury baths
Oversized desks with automated covering

The Luxurias will also feature two outboard engines so that they can be 
relocated or moved in the event of severe weather conditions. The vessels will 
be built at the Lauderdale Marine Center, which is the largest yacht-repair 
facility in the United States. The two flagship Luxuria vessels will also serve 
as sales models for custom-built units. 
Global Boatworks anticipates that is will receive a steady flow of custom orders 
and intends to move into the sales aspect of the business as soon as practical. 
While the Luxuria rental units will provide nice cash flow, the margins are much 
greater on custom sales.
