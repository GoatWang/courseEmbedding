Product Description"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, 'Take and eat it; this is My body.'" -Matthew 26:26 (HCSB) A follow-up to "Believer's Baptism" in the New American Commentary Studies in Bible & Theology series, "The Lord's Supper" explores the current Baptist view of the communion sacrament. Contributors include Andreas Kostenberger ("The Lord's Supper as a Passover Meal"), Jonathan Pennington ("The Last Supper in the Gospels"), Jim Hamilton ("The Lord's Supper in Paul"), and Michael Haykin ("Communion in the Early Church"). Adding a helpful perspective, chapters are also provided on the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Zwinglian views of communion.More Product InformationPublisher: B&H Publishing Group

Dr Jim Nicklin

“I could not in good conscience recommend Dr Jim Nicklin to anyone.  I underwent major surgery at his insistence. The outcome poor and, as it transpired, his diagnosis incorrect. He has not learned that a good doctor must LISTEN to and respect patients. He refers to women past child bearing age as 'little old ladies' - which I found to be extremely distasteful. His fees are also exorbitant. My advice: steer clear of this over confident and not so truthful 'gentleman'.”

Brooks Andrew J

“UNDER 1 MONTH AGO
Be careful if you use this surgery. The staff are horrible! I spoke to Donna the practice manager regarding no notification of my appointment being cancelled. I turned up at my arranged time to be told you should of received a call. Which I didn't. No attempt to compensate for the wasted day and time. I would not recommend it.

Ngweso Abigail

“This doctor was rude, to the point that my partner had an anxiety attack in the car park.  The doctor advised that she was too busy to look at the lession and that my partner should go to a skin clinic.  Rude ”

Reiter Loretta Dr

“Stay away from Dr Reiter. She is very dismissive of her patients and discourages them from doing their own research. Borderline bully - stay away!! There are much better and more supportive rheumatologisis out there.

Rebgetz Patrick

“Have been a Gold Coast patient of Dr Patrick Rebgetz for 18 years and I  totally trust him because his diagnosis is always correct.   It is so important when sickness strikes to have a skilled doctor who takes the time to listen and respond with kindness.   Thank you,  Lynne Burke.”

Doctor North Annandale

“We've taken our two young children to see him over the last 2 years with coughs and colds etc. He listens, is careful to rule out serious stuff but doesn't automatically medicate if its going to settle by itself. The best thing is being able to get in to see a good doctor at a few hours notice.
