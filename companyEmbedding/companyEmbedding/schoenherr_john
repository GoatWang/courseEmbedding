Publisher's Description▼▲
A Newbery Honor BookCelebrating 50 years of a beloved classic!Nothing's surprising in the North household, not even Sterling's new pet raccoon. Rascal is only a baby when Sterling brings him home, but soon the two are best friends, doing everything together--until the spring day when everything suddenly changes.Rascal is a heartwarming boyhood memoir that continues to find its way into the hearts of readers fifty years later. This special anniversary edition includes the book's classic illustrations restored to their original splendor, as well as a letter from the author's daughter, and material from the illustrator's personal collection."Everyone should knock off work, sit beneath the nearest tree, and enjoy Rascal from cover to cover."Chicago Tribune


Author Bio▼▲

He went on to have a career as a journalist and literary editor of several well-respected newspapers.  Sterling North won a host of literary awards during his lifetime, including a Newbery Honor for the autobiographical Rascal.

John Carl Schoenherr (July 5, 1935 – April 8, 2010)[1] was an American illustrator. He won the 1988 Caldecott Medal for U.S. children's book illustration, recognizing Owl Moon by Jane Yolen, a father-and-daughter story where only Schoenherr's drawings reveal the child's gender. He was posthumously inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015.[2][3]

Life[edit]
Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in Queens, "in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages.[1] He graduated from Stuyvesant High School,[4] and studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Will Barnet and at Pratt Institute.
Schoenherr was a resident of Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[5] He died on April 8, 2010, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Easton, Pennsylvania.[1]
Career[edit]
Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of Dune,[6] a 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert that inaugurated a book series and media franchise.[7] He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in Analog, an endeavor which secured him a 1965 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.[6][8] He later did the art for the Analog serialization of Herbert's Children of Dune.[6] In 1978 Berkley Books published The Illustrated Dune, an edition of Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr.[6][7] Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.[9]
Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the scratchboard technique, and he was long known as the only commercial artist who specialized in it. His paintings were often egg tempera, another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for NASA.[10][11][12] Schoenherr's knowledge of zoology was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society of Animal Artists, and the Society of Illustrators.
Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.[13] Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book. Under John W. Campbell, Jr. and Ben Bova at Analog, he also illustrated the first Dragonriders of Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, the 1967/1968 novellas "Weyr Search" and "Dragonrider" (each featured on one Analog cover as well) that were subsequently developed as the novel Dragonflight.[14] Schoenherr's July 1975 cover for Analog has been cited as influential in the designs for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.[15] He also worked for paperback and hardcover science fiction publishers like Ace Books and Doubleday.

Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.[13] Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book. Under John W. Campbell, Jr. and Ben Bova at Analog, he also illustrated the first Dragonriders of Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, the 1967/1968 novellas "Weyr Search" and "Dragonrider" (each featured on one Analog cover as well) that were subsequently developed as the novel Dragonflight.[14] Schoenherr's July 1975 cover for Analog has been cited as influential in the designs for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.[15] He also worked for paperback and hardcover science fiction publishers like Ace Books and Doubleday.

Life[edit]
Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in Queens, "in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages.[1] He graduated from Stuyvesant High School,[4] and studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Will Barnet and at Pratt Institute.
Schoenherr was a resident of Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[5] He died on April 8, 2010, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Easton, Pennsylvania.[1]
Career[edit]
Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of Dune,[6] a 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert that inaugurated a book series and media franchise.[7] He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in Analog, an endeavor which secured him a 1965 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.[6][8] He later did the art for the Analog serialization of Herbert's Children of Dune.[6] In 1978 Berkley Books published The Illustrated Dune, an edition of Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr.[6][7] Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.[9]
Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the scratchboard technique, and he was long known as the only commercial artist who specialized in it. His paintings were often egg tempera, another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for NASA.[10][11][12] Schoenherr's knowledge of zoology was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society of Animal Artists, and the Society of Illustrators.
Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.[13] Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book.

John Schoenherr biography




Written by Kirk Snavely
Prior to entering college, John Schoenherr considered a career
in biology. Fortunately for those of us who enjoy his work, he
preferred drawing to dissection and opted for art. His interest
in animals and rocks developed at an early age, and is reflected
in his illustrations for science fiction
and children's literature,
and in his wildlife art.
He was born in New York City in 1935. As a four-year-old he
drew pictures to communicate with his friends, who spoke Chinese,
Italian, Irish and Greek in the Babel of his Queens neighborhood.
He spoke only German at home, as his German father and Hungarian
mother were European immigrants. The desire to draw remained after
he learned English, listening to his mother practice it as she
read to him from the comic strips, and any available surface would
do. When he was eight his parents gave him a set of watercolors,
and soon after he was given oils. At thirteen he was taking the
subway into Manhattan to attend Saturday classes at the Art Students
League, where he studied etching and lithography under Will Barnet,
whom Schoenherr later credited as "getting me to see and
draw things realistically, instead of in a comic book mode"
(quoted in Frances Traher, John Schoenherr).
In the midst of the city he discovered the natural world, exploring
the abandoned lots and undeveloped fields in his neighborhood
as a young boy and becoming aware of the shapes and textures of
cobblestones at his doorstep. He sketched the animals at the Bronx
and Central Park zoos and drew habitat groups at the American
Museum of Natural History, where he came in contact with spelunkers
and learned about the Art Students League. Summer camps in the
Adirondacks were an occasion to draw the animals he encountered.
 He
began exploring caves as a teenager. The time spent underground
over the years informs his illustrations for Speleology
- Caves and the Cave Environment (1964, 1978, 1997),
such as the stalactites shown at right. The book was authored
by George W. Moore and Nicholas Sullivan. Above ground, rock climbing
gave him a daylight view of stone as well as a visceral feel for
its texture, knowledge he would use in later work. He also enjoyed
hiking and camping, just being outdoors, spending weeks alone
exploring the woods and rivers of the Adirondacks.
After high school Schoenherr attended the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn, where he enjoyed photography but (ironically) failed
nature drawing. He was more concerned with drawing accurately
while the instructor stressed self-expression. During the summers
he returned to the Art Students League, where Frank Reilly introduced
him to the old French Academy style of painting. Among the instructors
who influenced him at Pratt were Richard Bové, Frederico
Castellon, Stanley Meltzoff, William A. Smith, and Khosrov Ajootian,
who helped him with his draftsmanship, getting the right contours.
Schoenherr admired the use of light in the work of the old masters
Van Eyck, Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Vermeer. He also liked the
photographs of Edward Weston, with their monumental stones and
their simplicity and strength of composition.
After graduating from Pratt with a B.F.A.

in 1956, he worked for a short while cutting mats in a studio
then became a free-lance illustrator and never looked back. His
simple philosophy was to adapt the client's needs to his own vision
and make the best picture he could.
   . 
.  .  Worlds of Imagination
The NESFA Press, 1977
 (Back to top) Schoenherr made his first professional
sale while still in college, collecting $20 from Amazing
Stories in 1956. His affinity for science fiction
(SF) began in childhood, when he read Jules Verne's Mysterious
Island, illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. As a reader he had
admired Richard Powers's ethereal paperback covers and Edd Cartier's
lively magazine interiors for their ability to enhance the text
of a story. After graduation from Pratt, Schoenherr was able to
get work in the field and contributed interior illustrations to
a variety of SF magazines
over the next several years, primarily Amazing Stories,

Fantastic, and Infinity.
The tongue-in-cheek Noah's ark piece at right, from Adam Chase's
Deadly Honeymoon in the June 1957 issue of Fantastic,
is an early depiction of alien fauna.

F&SF, 1959 
Analog, 1962
In his early portrayals of humans, the eyes are often visible.
One example, at far left, is from A. Bertram Chandler's The
Man Who Could Not Stop, in the May 1959 issue of The
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF).
The eyes tend to disappear in shadow later on, however, as in
the drawing at near left from Raymond F. Jones's The Great
Gray Plague in the February 1962 issue of Analog.
This lends his drawings a darker, more abstract quality in my
view.
In 1958 began what for him would be a long association with
Astounding Science Fiction, which changed
its name to Analog in 1960. He had been
reading Astounding since high school
and preferred the tone of the magazine. His art dominated the
covers of Analog during the sixties.
Many of his early cover paintings were done in egg tempera or
oils, and are somewhat subdued in color compared to his work after
1964, which includes acrylics. Schoenherr's covers portrayed a
variety of settings and moods as shown below, from future police
stations (February 1963) to sandstorms on a desert planet (December
1963), from whimsical (July 1965) to startling (February 1972).

    February 1972


Code Three (February 1963) is an example
of his compositional skill. My eyes are led around the page, from
the 'face' on the cruiser with its contrasting red light, green
windshield and white 'mouth', to the textures and rectangular
patterns of the pavement stones, overhead lights and brick wall.
The cover for Dune World (December 1963) demonstrates
his ability to create a dramatic scene. The lines of eroded gullies
in the foreground converge on the two running figures, who are
dwarfed by the massive rock formation that dominates the picture,
a potential shelter from the approaching storm in the background.
The stark contrast of this scene with the two moons floating in
the serene blue sky further emphasizes the danger. A reproduction
of the cover for Trader Team (July 1965) hangs in my
living room and whenever I look at it, it is fresh. Perhaps it
is the eyes of the centauroid saurian, the masterful lighting
on his skin or the contrast in color between his skin and the
sky. Fido (February 1972) reminds me of other media images
from the early seventies, for its shock value. The cover is both
disturbing and attractive.
His covers include elements that elicit a second look from
the observer. What are the human figures doing in the background
of Code Three? Is that a rock spire or a rocket ship
in the background of Trader Team? Is something falling
out of the sky in Fido, and why does the sky appear to
be burning?
 John W. Campbell,
Jr., who was the editor of Astounding/Analog,
had a preference for scratchboard for the interior illustrations
of his magazine. Scratchboard showed up well in the primitive
letterpress printing that was used at the time for the SF pulps,
and Schoenherr was a master of this medium. One example is the
Siamese cat at left, from Mario Brand's The Spy (Analog,
April 1964) (click on the image to obtain something approximating
the actual size of the illustration in the magazine). The cat's
eyes are luminous. The larger size of the magazine for this year
('bedsheet', or 8¼ inches by 11 inches) enabled more detail
to be seen in the illustrations.
 Using
his considerable knowledge of animals he enjoyed creating convincing
aliens, designing his own or fleshing out the author's descriptions.
The atmospheric rendering of Azkashi shown at right is from Poul
Anderson's The Ancient Gods (Analog,
June 1966).
 
When his favorite type of scratchboard (Rossboard)
became unavailable after the manufacturer's proprietor passed
away, Schoenherr explored other media. He started using acrylic
drybrush because he could scratch into it, but did less of that
over time. Anne McCaffrey's Pernese dragons (Weyr Search,
Analog, October 1967), shown above right,
were done in acrylic over gesso and modeled on dinosaurs. Then
he started using rough watercolor paper with 'bowl-pointed' post
office pens and drybrush with Japanese brushes. He created marvelous
texture using this technique, as in the crazy quilt of the spaceship's
cargo hold, above left, from Spider Robinson's When No Man
Pursueth (Analog, November 1974).
It is a three-dimensional scene that appeals to his spelunking
days. When the pulps went to offset printing, he tried some 'wipe-out'
techniques, but they weren't too popular.
Occasionally he would tweak your funny bone. The baboons below
are doing their own version of the Three Monkeys, in Bernard Deitchman's
Chester (Analog, June 1973).

In 1961 Schoenherr started painting paperback covers for science
fiction, horror, and fantasy, primarily for Pyramid and Ace. (He
was also doing paperback covers in travel adventure and natural
history.) His early covers showed some influence from Surrealism,
a movement in art that was adopted for paperback covers in science
fiction the previous decade by Richard Powers. The dreamlike qualities
of The Green Rain (1961) include the spiky tree,
the human forms moving along the single road across the barren
plain to the abstract city, and the rain that looks more like
a green aurora. When I first looked at the cover of More
Macabre (1961), I saw what I thought was the profile
of a dinosaur-like head with a large eye and ear hole. Only later
did I see it as the frontal view of a primate-like head, missing
one eye! Either way it is a striking cover. For me the blade of
grass is a 'whatsit?' element.

He quickly developed his own more representational style, typified
by biomorphic machines (1964) and buildings (1987), alien encounters
(1966), and faces with strained or sardonic expressions (1970),
often set against brightly colored backgrounds. A good Schoenherr
cover, be it a magazine or paperback, has a presence

to it.
 In
the science fiction genre, Schoenherr's name is perhaps most closely
associated with Frank Herbert's novel Dune, originally
published as two serials in Analog,
Dune World and The Prophet of Dune, between
1963 and 1965. Schoenherr's illustrations for Dune World,
rendered in scratchboard, and for The Prophet of Dune,
using acrylic drybrush on illustration board, helped garner him
the 1965 Hugo award for Best Artist. He later produced all-new
illustrations for The Illustrated Dune, published
in 1978. The sandworm at left is from the 1978 Dune Calendar.
Frank Herbert was so impressed with Schoenherr's work that he
once referred to him as "the only man who has ever visited
Dune" (quoted in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction).
Noted SF illustrator
Vincent Di Fate holds John Schoenherr in high esteem, saying he
is "one of the very best artists to have ever worked in the
science fiction genre" (personal communication). Schoenherr
worked diligently in the genre for a decade, producing some of
his best illustrations for Analog in
the sixties and providing close to 100 paperback covers for Pyramid
and Ace. Yet he remained relatively poor. At the time, publishers
were not paying competitive rates for SF
illustration. In the late sixties he lost interest in the subject
matter. Following a short hiatus he returned to Analog
for several years in the seventies then, aside from a rare appearance
now and then, he left the field of SF

illustration. 
but around the corner  .  .  .   
Sports Cars Illustrated
September 1957

(Back to top) Around this time he and his
young son Ian, who is currently a talented illustrator, worked
on a science fiction novel for young readers, Lee Harding's The
Fallen Spaceman (1980). Schoenherr was no stranger to
children's literature however. Coincidence played a part in his
first book assignment, Sterling North's Rascal
(1963), about a boy and his pet raccoon. Both Schoenherr and the
first illustrator chosen for the book occasionally did art work
for the Bronx zoo, though they had not met. That artist was too
busy to work on the book. On the basis of what he had seen of
Schoenherr's zoo work, he recommended him to the publisher's art
director, who happened to be a fan of science fiction. Schoenherr's
scratchboard illustrations for Rascal, which
was a Newbery honor book, attracted the attention of other publishers,
and over the years he illustrated close to fifty hardcover wildlife
books for children and young adults. Other well-known titles include
Walt Morey's Gentle Ben (1965) and Jean Craighead
George's Julie of the Wolves (1972), which won
the John Newbery Medal. (The Newbery Medal is awarded to the book
which showed the most distinguished writing for children in the
previous year.)
 In
Robert Murphy's The Golden Eagle (1965), the
hungry mountain lion at right faces off with a porcupine (not
shown). Schoenherr captures the concentration in the cat's posture
and does a beautiful job depicting the texture of the lion's fur.
The fox in Miska Miles's Fox and the Fire (1966),
shown below, is unconcerned as he scratches his ear. Here we see
Schoenherr's dramatic scratchboard style. In 1968 Schoenherr wrote
and illustrated The Barn (an ALA
Notable Book), inspired by a skunk he observed waddling into a
neighbor's run-down barn.
 
Allan W. Eckert's Incident at Hawk's
Hill (1971) is based on a true story of a little boy
who became lost in rural Manitoba, Canada, and was adopted by
a female badger. The chance meeting of the two is depicted in
the scene at left. For me, the continuity of the boy's hair with
the grass and the badger's fur suggests a link between boy and
badger, while the shading of the badger's back into the paper
denotes the unexpected nature of the meeting. By 1978 Schoenherr
had illustrated ten of Miska Miles's books. Looking at the otter
below, from Miska Miles's Otter in the Cove (1974),
I get a real sense of the ocean.

 Sometimes
he worked in pre-separated color. Printers charged more for doing
separations than illustrators. He used a 'wipe-out' technique
for Theodore Clymer's The Travels of Atunga (1973).
The Eskimo Atunga watches Sun dance with Moon in the scene shown
at left. In Joanne Ryder's Simon Underground

(1976), he combined color with the texture of drybrush on watercolor
paper. Below, Simon the mole digs his way to the surface and Springtime.
The toad appears to have been rudely awakened!

After The Fallen Spaceman,
Schoenherr spent the next seven years happily focused on his own
wildlife painting. Then he read a Jane Yolen manuscript given
to him by a friend and editor at Philomel, and accepted the assignment
to illustrate the book without hesitation. He had taken his own
children owling in the woods when they were small, and he resonated
with the attitudes toward the wild found in Jane's prose. In addition,
for the first time in children's literature he could work in full
color, and he chose pen with watercolor on d'Arches paper. The
woods around his farm formed the setting and his wife's suggestion
of including the small animals hidden in the landscape helped
enliven the winter scenes. John Schoenherr won the 1988 Randolph
Caldecott Medal for his work on Owl Moon. The
Caldecott is for the illustrator of the most distinguished picture
book for children in the previous year.
 With
the success of Owl Moon, Philomel encouraged
Schoenherr to write and illustrate more children's books. For
Bear (1991), a story of growth and survival of
a young bear, he traveled to the Alaskan Peninsula to study the
coastal species. In the watercolor at right, produced for the
book, the bear wanders through mountains and snowfields and valleys
of ash in search of food. In Rebel (1995), a
curious gosling goes exploring, unaware of potential dangers in
pond and forest. In both books each realistic watercolor is a
two-page spread. Scholastic commissioned him to contribute watercolors
in a more playful mode to From Sea to Shining Sea

(Amy L. Cohn, ed., 1993) and Lynn
Plourde's Pigs in the Mud in the Middle of the Rud
(1997), well worth the enjoyable read.
   . 
.  .  Outside the Box  .  .  . 
Reader's Digest, July 1966
(Back to top) From a young age Schoenherr
had a desire to paint wildlife. He began painting wildlife in
his teens and continued to do so for assignments at Pratt and
while making a living as an illustrator, all the while improving
his fine art technique. He traveled widely to study and photograph
animals that he would later paint in his studio, an old barn that
he himself rebuilt. The barn was located on the 24-acre rural
farm near Locktown, New Jersey where he lived with his family.








    Red Rocks, oil, 1989


 
The American West appealed to him. On his first trip to the
western United States in 1960, while attending a spelunker's convention
in Wyoming with his wife Judy, he encountered bison. Over the
years he climbed cliffs after mountain goats in Montana and photographed
sea otters in California. During return trips to the western deserts
and caves he grew to love the stone and dirt there, the underlying
structure of the landscape, in preference to the eastern woodlands.
Many of his wildlife paintings are set in rugged, barren landscapes.

Outpost, acrylic, 1976 
Some of his field trips were commissioned. The National Park
Service hired him to paint bears in the Great Smoky Mountains.
As official artist of a tour to Puerto Rico he painted the cave
where the Camuy river flows. On a month-long trip to Iran, commissioned
to paint the wildlife there, he and his wife came upon tigers,
leopards, red deer, brown bear, and wild goats while hiking in
the Elburz Mountains, and were chased by a wild boar! The boar
can be found in The Art of Painting Wild Animals
(1975), part of the Grumbacher series.
In 1979 Schoenherr made his first trip to Alaska. During a
month spent photographing and studying the huge Alaska brown bear
at Katmai National Monument, he came to identify with the bear,
though he soon learned not to carry food with him on the trails.
He made many return trips to Alaska. During one trip he was surprised
to suddenly see a 700 lb brown bear
in the viewfinder of his camera; the bear passed within six feet
of him while he remained motionless!
Illustration continued to pay the bills but Schoenherr chafed
at the constraints and compromises involved. As he described in
his Caldecott Medal acceptance speech:

I gradually learned, however, that my most satisfactory work
  was based on intuitive discovery, usually while painting and
  usually at the last minute. This approach is not accepted gracefully
  by most publishers. They require sketches, done on schedule,
  and finished work which relates to the sketches - also done on
  schedule. I was discovering that my best ideas usually happen
  in hindsight and on their own schedule. . . . I found the compromises
  of illustration too limiting and devoted myself fully to creating
  my own images, painted in my own manner and done on my own schedule.

In the late seventies he devoted himself to easel painting,
creating large paintings for galleries, and managed to make a
living at it. His work has won awards and hangs in private collections
and in museums and galleries around the country, including the
Carson Gallery in Denver and the Spanierman Gallery.
In the field his sketchbook is a camera. Schoenherr relies
on photographs, and sometimes movies, to study movement, color
and configuration. Most of his paintings begin as visions, whether
using a photograph as a springboard or recalling an image that
persists in his memory. He does not paint actual scenes. Art comes
before subject matter.

Pallas' Cat, egg tempera, 1969 

In his early work, Schoenherr showed an affinity
for cats. He portrayed many members of the cat family, often working
in egg tempera on panel. The cachets for the 1983 Belize World
Wildlife Fund Stamp issue honoring the jaguar were painted by
him. At right is a proof page featuring one of his watercolors.
His preference later shifted to working in oils on canvas and
painting large monochromatic mammals that he could use a big brush
on, particularly bears. To him, bears represent intelligence and
power, and recall a primeval age. Oil paint was a flexible medium
that allowed him to make major changes on the canvas.








    Bear with Salmon, oil, 1986


During the creative process he will often rework a painting
until it pleases him. In one extreme case he worked on a painting
of a tiger for eleven years! His art is characterized by strong
compositions and draftsmanship, as well as masterful lighting.
With a few brush strokes and a heavy application of paint he creates
the illusion of detail, be it fur texture or feather markings.
His canvases tend to be large, as well as long and narrow.








    First Outing, oil, 1985


In referring to the animals he has encountered in the wild,
Schoenherr states (Caldecott speech):

Large or small, I feel awe and wonder and respect. They are
  all presences and personalities, alien and largely unfathomable,
  but worth acceptance and contemplation for what they are. This
  is what I've found worth trying to express in my work.

He continues to communicate through his art.









    Two's Company, oil, 1992


John Schoenherr and fellow SF
artists were honored at Chicon
2000 in an exhibition of science fiction art of the fifties
and sixties. His watercolors for Owl Moon have toured the country.
A major retrospective of his wildlife painting and illustration,
John Schoenherr: Beyond the Edge and Deep Within, was
held at the Hiram Blauvelt Art Museum in 1997.

Publisher's Description▼▲
A Newbery Honor BookCelebrating 50 years of a beloved classic!Nothing's surprising in the North household, not even Sterling's new pet raccoon. Rascal is only a baby when Sterling brings him home, but soon the two are best friends, doing everything together--until the spring day when everything suddenly changes.Rascal is a heartwarming boyhood memoir that continues to find its way into the hearts of readers fifty years later. This special anniversary edition includes the book's classic illustrations restored to their original splendor, as well as a letter from the author's daughter, and material from the illustrator's personal collection."Everyone should knock off work, sit beneath the nearest tree, and enjoy Rascal from cover to cover."Chicago TribuneFrom the Trade Paperback edition.


Author Bio▼▲
Sterling North was born into a family of poets and was himself first published at age eight. He went on to have a career as a journalist and literary editor of several well-respected newspapers.  Sterling North won a host of literary awards during his lifetime, including a Newbery Honor for the autobiographical Rascal.

John Carl Schoenherr (July 5, 1935 – April 8, 2010)[1] was an American illustrator. He won the 1988 Caldecott Medal for U.S. children's book illustration, recognizing Owl Moon by Jane Yolen, a father-and-daughter story where only Schoenherr's drawings reveal the child's gender. He was posthumously inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015.[2][3]

Life[edit]
Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in Queens, "in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages.[1] He graduated from Stuyvesant High School,[4] and studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Will Barnet and at Pratt Institute.
Schoenherr was a resident of Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[5] He died on April 8, 2010, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Easton, Pennsylvania.[1]
Career[edit]
Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of Dune,[6] a 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert that inaugurated a book series and media franchise.[7] He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in Analog, an endeavor which secured him a 1965 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.[6][8] He later did the art for the Analog serialization of Herbert's Children of Dune.[6] In 1978 Berkley Books published The Illustrated Dune, an edition of Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr.[6][7] Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.[9]
Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the scratchboard technique, and he was long known as the only commercial artist who specialized in it. His paintings were often egg tempera, another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for NASA.[10][11][12] Schoenherr's knowledge of zoology was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society of Animal Artists, and the Society of Illustrators.
Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.[13] Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book. Under John W. Campbell, Jr. and Ben Bova at Analog, he also illustrated the first Dragonriders of Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, the 1967/1968 novellas "Weyr Search" and "Dragonrider" (each featured on one Analog cover as well) that were subsequently developed as the novel Dragonflight.[14] Schoenherr's July 1975 cover for Analog has been cited as influential in the designs for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.[15] He also worked for paperback and hardcover science fiction publishers like Ace Books and Doubleday.

He won the 1988 Caldecott Medal for U.S. children's book illustration, recognizing Owl Moon by Jane Yolen, a father-and-daughter story where only Schoenherr's drawings reveal the child's gender. He was posthumously inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015.[2][3]

Life[edit]
Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in Queens, "in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages.[1] He graduated from Stuyvesant High School,[4] and studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Will Barnet and at Pratt Institute.
Schoenherr was a resident of Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[5] He died on April 8, 2010, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Easton, Pennsylvania.[1]
Career[edit]
Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of Dune,[6] a 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert that inaugurated a book series and media franchise.[7] He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in Analog, an endeavor which secured him a 1965 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.[6][8] He later did the art for the Analog serialization of Herbert's Children of Dune.[6] In 1978 Berkley Books published The Illustrated Dune, an edition of Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr.[6][7] Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.[9]
Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the scratchboard technique, and he was long known as the only commercial artist who specialized in it. His paintings were often egg tempera, another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for NASA.[10][11][12] Schoenherr's knowledge of zoology was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society of Animal Artists, and the Society of Illustrators.
Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres.[13] Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book. Under John W. Campbell, Jr. and Ben Bova at Analog, he also illustrated the first Dragonriders of Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, the 1967/1968 novellas "Weyr Search" and "Dragonrider" (each featured on one Analog cover as well) that were subsequently developed as the novel Dragonflight.[14] Schoenherr's July 1975 cover for Analog has been cited as influential in the designs for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.[15] He also worked for paperback and hardcover science fiction publishers like Ace Books and Doubleday.

BPL to Host “Score Big” with New York Jets’ Wide Receiver Jerricho Cotchery





The Birmingham Public Library (BPL) is excited to once again host its “Score Big” with “Make Waves @ Your Library” and the Cotchery Foundation as part of its summer reading initiative. Jerricho Cotchery of the New York Jets, one of Birmingham’s native sons, has teamed himself and his foundation with the Library for this exciting reading challenge.Cotchery founded The Cotchery Foundation in January 2007. He was moved to start the foundation as a result of his own personal memories and experiences growing up. He and his foundation have set out to “show that anyone can do extraordinary things if they have the desire and passion.” Simply stated, Cotchery has made it his mission to show that any individual can make a significant difference in the lives of others.For the past three years, The Cotchery Foundation has hosted a Skills and Drills Football Clinic with Jerricho Cotchery. In 2009, The Foundation asked the Birmingham Public Library to join them to enrich the experience. In order to register for the 2010 Skills and Drills Football Clinic, youth from 11-18 must have completed the “Score Big” component of the “Make Waves @ Your Library” summer reading program.  Seven points are necessary to qualify. Youth may score points by registering for the program (1 point), reading an entire magazine (3 points), and reading an entire book (6 points). “Score Big” registration forms are available at all Birmingham Public Library locations. The completed registration forms are due by June 9, 2010. Only two hundred participants will be selected to attend the Skills and Drills Football Clinic. Those selected will be notified by June 15, 2010.  In addition to being eligible for the Skills and Drills Football Clinic, all those who “Score Big” are invited to a Teen Tailgate Party at the Birmingham Public Library on Friday, June 25, 2010.  The celebration will take place on the first floor of the Central Library, located at 2100 Park Place, from 7:00 p.m. until 9:00 p.m.  There will be music, dancing, photo ops with Jerricho, food and lots of fun.

Staff Pick: Joseph Had a Little Overcoat (ages 4 & up, 1999)





Are your kids a tad materialistic? Do they want every toy they see? Do they just assume anything they break will be replaced by you? Call me a sucker, but I drove to two stores last night looking for a Lego Indiana Jones set so that my son could take one of the 2" tall figures to school and play with a classmate. Go ahead, call me a sucker; my husband did.Thinking on last night reminded me of Joseph Had a Little Overcoat, a 2000 Caldecott Medal winner by Simms Taback that teaches the virtues of thrift and being happy with what you have. Or as Simms sums it up: "You can always make something out of nothing." He adapted the story from a Yiddish folk song he sang as a child.In what appears to be a turn-of-the-century Jewish village, Joseph is wearing a worn overcoat with patches holding it together. Did he throw it in the trash bin and head to town to buy a new one? No! He made a jacket out of it and went to the fair, where he had a blast. Before long "Joseph had a little jacket. It got old and worn./So he made a vest out of it and danced at his nephew's wedding." And so the frugality begins. I won't give away any more of the story. It's fun to see what Joseph turns the increasingly more worn and shrinking item into.What's unique about this book is that every few pages is die-cut, which means that there is a space cut out of the page large enough to fit whatever new piece of clothing Joseph makes.  The die-cuts get smaller as the pages are turned. There is lots going on in every scene to keep your child on his toes: friends peaking into a window; an old man asleep while singing in the choir; funny newspaper headlines like "Fiddler on the Roof Falls Off the Roof"; hanging platitudes on the walls of Joseph's humble home.Joseph Had a Little Overcoat is a simple but fun book that teaches a moral without being preachy.Here's a video sampling of Joseph Had a Little Overcoat, with lyrics taken from the folk song. It's not the entire story, and the video is missing the charm of the book, so don't forget to check out the book and take it home!Links: The Official Web Site of Simms TabackFor more reader’s advisory, visit our Bookletters page.

Book Review—Breathers: A Zombie's Lament





Not as successfully satirical as Christopher Moore nor as gross as Chuck Palahniuk, Breathers by S.G. Browne manages to elicit some chuckles about the how the undead try to make it in the world of the living.Andy reanimated in his coffin at his funeral, and his parents felt obligated to sponsor him by taking him into their home. Andy left his young daughter an orphan when he slammed his car into a tree after drinking too much, killing himself temporarily and his wife permanently.No one knows why some corpses reanimate, and it's tough deciding what to do with them. They can't hold jobs because who's buying anything a smelly, decomposing zombie is selling? They have no rights because they're technically not alive. People are free to hurl obscenities at them, throw perfectly good food at them from their cars, and attack and kill them (again) without any legal ramifications.Andy attends Undead Anonymous just to get out of his parents' wine cellar every week, but he can't participate in the group discussions because his larynx is crushed and he's still sporting stitches from where the embalmer sewed his lips shut. He bathes in Pine-Sol, but he's still embarrassed about his graveyard odor.But he eventually makes friends with some members of the group: Rita, a beautiful suicide who eats makeup hoping the chemicals will stave off rot; Jerry, a girlie magazine enthusiast; Tom, a vegetarian whose arm is stolen during a fraternity hazing; and Ray, whose wife went missing and who generously shares jars of preserved mystery meat with the group.As Andy starts venturing out of the wine cellar and onto the streets, he feels the weight of zombie injustice on his shoulders, and becomes a mouthpiece for the civil rights of the undead. Then he and his fellow Undead Anonymous group start healing in miraculous ways. Now with two heartbeats per minute, will he risk his second chance at life and the awful prospects of being shipped off to a zombie zoo or losing his head to a teaching college to become the Martin Luther King Jr. of zombies?There are some laugh-out-loud  moments and some repellent moments that will turn you a nice shade of zombie green, but Breathers shouldn't be missed by fans of the popular zombie genre.Links:The Official Home Page of S.G.

How to make the most of Library Databases





The video above shows how to get started using our library databases to access reliable and up-to-date information. Why use library databases at http://www.bplonline.org/ when we have Google? Here are four reasons:Databases go beyond Google to provide an in-depth collections of information that is not available on the Web for free. Library databases save you time by helping you quickly find high-quality articles related to your subject. These organized collections of information allow you to narrowly focus your search in ways that search engines do not. The information contained within library databases has gone through an editorial process and as a result are more reliable than the average information found on the web.Despite its size, the Web holds only a fraction of the world's published information.

Tree Planting in Kelly Ingram Park Heals Wounds of Intolerance and Injustice





Pictured in foreground from left to right with shovel: Sarah Collins Rudolph, Carolyn McKinstry, Sidni Smith and Max Herzel. Other program participants and planners are in the background. Several program committee members are not pictured but listed in the text of the release.It was a perfect spring day for an outing in the park. Yet, the gathering in Kelly Ingram Park on Sunday, April 11 was no ordinary excursion. A diverse cross section of Birmingham gathered to dedicate a horse chestnut tree symbolic of the one a Jewish teen, Anne Frank, saw from her hiding place during the Holocaust. The inspiration for the project came from community leader Joel Rotenstreich. In June 2009, he learned that the Anne Frank Center in New York was giving eleven saplings from the original tree to cities in the United States—locations that had known discrimination and intolerance. Rotenstreich quickly assembled a committee to apply for a grant feeling that Birmingham was the perfect choice.Though Birmingham was not selected to receive an original sapling, Joel and the committee were not deterred. On Sunday, April 11, 2010, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, the Birmingham Holocaust Education Committee, the Birmingham Jewish Federation’s Jewish Community Relations Committee, the Birmingham Public Library and Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, with support from the City of Birmingham Parks and Recreation Board, dedicated their own horse chestnut tree. A plaque with Anne Frank’s words, "how wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world,” marks the tree’s location in the park. Sidni Smith, a student at Birmingham City School's Phillips Academy, shared in the celebration by reading a poem she wrote for the special occasion.Please visit BPL's Press Room to read the press release about this event.Upcoming April Brown Bag Lunch programs on the Holocaust are listed on Eventkeeper.

Nonfiction Book Review—Look! It's Jesus: Amazing Holy Visions in Everyday Life





I am not one to knock religion, but I will confess that Look! It's Jesus: Amazing Holy Visions in Everyday Life by Harry and Sandra Choron brought me many chuckles as I learned the imaginative ways Jesus manifests Himself onto everyday objects. From wood-grain doors to tie-dye towels to pierogies, Jesus is the king of self-promotion.My favorites? Ashtray Jesus; Frying Pan Jesus; and Cheesus—a Cheese Curl in the shape of a kneeling, praying Jesus.And it's not just Jesus who wants to get the word out, but Mary, Buddha, and even Mother Teresa.  (The book is worth flipping through just for the stern Nun Bun.)And since not all religious images are evident, one can even make a game of trying to spot them, similar to Where's Waldo?This book does not come off as mocking religion; in fact, the entries are endearing and one can almost hear the glee in the voice of the first person to point and yell, "Look! It's Jesus."For more reader’s advisory, visit our Bookletters page. Bookletters offers book reviews, author bios and interviews, book group discussion guides, audio clips, and much more.

2010 NBA Playoffs





The NBA Playoffs start this weekend. In the West, Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers are trying to make their 3rd straight appearance in the NBA Finals. The Lakers are last year’s champion and hope to take the trophy back to Los Angeles. In the East, LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers finished another great season as the No. 1 seed with the best record in the NBA. They came up short last year, losing to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Cavs have changed the look of their team adding Shaquille O’Neal and Antawn Jamison to help them make a successful playoff run. There are several other teams competing to prevent the expected Cavs-Lakers Final. The Orlando Magic want a chance to prove that their NBA Finals appearance last year was not a fluke. Will they make it back to the Finals like last year’s Lakers team and come away with a victory? The Denver Nuggets coasted through the playoffs last year but couldn't get past Los Angeles in the Western Conference Finals. They want another chance and will be playing hard for Coach George Karl who was diagnosed with neck and throat cancer late in the season. As always, the NBA Playoffs should be fun and exciting. Check out the Basketball subject guide for books, websites, and current articles about the NBA.

Children's and Sci-Fi Book Illustrator John Schoenherr Dies





Frank Herbert was so taken with Schoenherr's illustrations, he declared Schoenherr to be  "the only man who has ever visited Dune."Well-known artist and illustrator John Schoenherr died on April 8 of chronic pulmonary disease. He was 74. He illustrated more than 40 children's books and hundreds of science fiction covers, including some for Philip K. Dick, Anne McCaffrey, and John Brunner.This wildlife artist who once said he identified more with animals than people, grew up in New York City.  His family spoke German but the children in his Queens neighborhood spoke English, Chinese, and Italian. Feeling like a mute he picked up some chalk and drew, learning English later on from comic strips.At age 8 Schoenherr received his first set of paints, and at 13 began taking Saturday classes at the Art Students League in New York City. He started getting recognition as a science fiction illustrator when he was 21. He credits John Campbell, publisher of Astounding Science Fiction magazine (now Analog Science Fiction and Fact), for the opportunity to hone his personal brand of realism through illustrating for the magazine.Schoenherr was the first artist to draw the world of Frank Herbert's Dune and Anne McCaffrey's Pern. "Dune World" and "The Prophet of Dune" was published in two parts in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1963 and 1965; in 1965 he won a Hugo Award for Best Artist. From the 1950s to the late 1970s, Schoenherr contributed hundreds of his imaginative drawings to science fiction books and magazines.Schoenherr won a Caldecott Medal for illustrating Jane Yolen's Owl Moon, a story about a man and his daughter who bundle up and go "owling" on a cold, moonlit night; and he illustrated Jean Craighead George's Julie of the Wolves, winner of the 1973 Newbery Medal. Schoenherr is the author of several children's books, including The Barn and Bear.In a 1967 letter John Campbell wrote mourning the loss of Schoenherr to Reader's Digest and big publishing companies because they paid more, he called Schoenherr "the best artist science fiction ever had." Schoenherr is survived by his wife, Judith; his son Ian and daughter Jennifer; two grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Ian Schoenherr is a also writer and illustrator of children's books.

Pride and Passion: The African-American Baseball Experience





Black baseball players, shut out of the major leagues in the late 19th century, organized their own baseball clubs, and starting in the 1920s, formed their own leagues. This exhibition tells the story of Negro League baseball and how it grew into a multi-million dollar enterprise and became the focus of great pride in the African American community. Players like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and James “Cool Papa” Bell, and teams like the Chicago American Giants, Kansas City Monarchs, St. Louis Stars, and Pittsburgh Crawfords drew enthusiastic crowds, developed a reputation for a fast-running, power-hitting game, and paved the way for the integration of the sport.Visit the Pride and Passion page for a schedule of events, resources, photographs, articles, and more dealing with this fascinating time in baseball history.DetailsPride and Passion ExhibitionCentral LibraryMay 1 - June 11, 2010

Tom Clancy's Own A-Team





Remember the great '80s TV show The A-Team? Headed up by a cigar-chomping man named Hannibal, it was about a group of law-skating misfits whose  specialized talents worked in harmony every week to make a plan "come together" to thwart the bad guys.Well, perhaps Tom Clancy was a fan because he's compiling his own A-Team of characters from his many thrillers for Dead or Alive, a story about modern terrorism due out on December 7. This will be his first book in seven years and is a collaboration with U.S. Navy veteran Grant Blackwood, who has also teamed up with writer Clive Cussler.Clancy's all-star A-Team will include the characters Jack Ryan, Jack Ryan Jr., John Clark, Ding Chavez, and Mary Pat Foley. Their mission is to capture "The Emir," the mastermind of terrorist attacks on the West.To tie this A-Team theme together, I'm including the trailer for the cool A-Team movie coming out on June 11. Ladies, I classify this as a chick flick since there are so many heartthrobs in it. Look! It's Wikus, the wife-adoring nerd prawn from District 9. And Phil, the scruffy-faced lovable lout from The Hangover.  Now I don't know who Quinton "Rampage" Jackson is, but like Liam Neeson and Patrick Wilson, he's easy on the eyes. So score some brownie points with the man in your life and volunteer to see this movie.

National Poetry Month





The library. A portal. Books. Technology. Inquiries flow through fingertips at play. Information dwells across stories of stories; past, present, and future mingle seamlessly together.April is National Poetry Month. As you can tell from the lines above, I am not the poet laureate of the library. However, we have poetry by the current United States Poet Laureate, Kay Ryan. We also have poetry by Pulitzer Prize winners, Nobel Laureates, and countless other poets from around the world.Check out the National Poetry Month display in the Arts, Literature, and Sports Department. If you need information on writing poetry or getting your poetry published, we have books on that as well. If you will excuse me, I have to go work on my next masterpiece.

Sarah Langan Wins Bram Stoker Award for Audrey's Door





I am thrilled that Sarah Langan's Audrey's Door has won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel! Langan certainly deserves this honor.Audrey's Door is a chilling read about cults and architecture reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby. Audrey Lucas runs from a painful childhood, a bi-polar mother, a demanding job, and a fiance,  right into the welcoming arms of the Breviary, an old Manhattan apartment building with a questionable history of tenant suicides and murders. But the rent is cheap and the deal too good to pass up.The incestuous, elderly, trust fund baby tenants of the Breviary need a door to the Other Side built, and through new rental trial and error they're closer than ever to seeing it happen. The tenant before Audrey got close, but her door wasn't finished because of a tragedy that struck her and her children. The elderly clan who run the Breviary are creepy, watchful, and "selfish as the day is long" to quote Minnie Castevet from Rosemary's Baby.Slowly Audrey begins losing touch with reality and wakes feeling battered and bruised. Her breakdown is brought on by fevered and exhausting dreams about building a door...to where? And what wants to come through it? Is she working too hard? Is it her OCD? As her past and present fuse together, what or whom will she sacrifice to give the tenants what they desire?Through the smallest of details Sarah Langan builds upon the layers of her secondary characters, making Audrey's Door believable and horrifying. Even Audrey's boyfriend Saraub and his mother are treated as fully-fleshed characters and not mere tools to move the plot along. This book has made me a Langan fan.Winners of the 2009 Bram Stoker Awards are:Best Novel: Audrey's Door by Sarah Langan Best First Novel: Damnable by Hank SchwaebleBest Long Fiction: The Lucid Dreaming by Lisa MortonBest Short Fiction: "In the Porches of My Ears," by Norman PrentissBest Anthology: He is Legend: An Anthology Celebrating Richard Matheson edited by Christopher ConlonBest Collection: A Taste of Tenderloin by Gene O'NeillBest Non-Fiction: Writers Workshop of Horror by Michael KnostBest Poetry: Chimeric Machines by Lucy A.

Meet Chandra





Jasmine has a talent, a real gift. She’s smart too. So what does a girl have to do to get her parents to approve of her spinning and music? To make things worse, when music execs take an interest in her, folks change how they act towards her. That's what happens when you Spin It Like That.

Taylor wrote that story, along with The Pledge and its sequel, The Promise. She also owns Taylor Editorial Service, which edits manuscripts for aspiring and established authors. Her goal in writing these stories is to reach people who go through similar struggles and help them apply lessons to their real lives. Every teen deals with wanting to obey their parents and also wanting to follow their dreams. Sometimes, those two are totally different. So what do you do?

Come meet Chandra Sparks Taylor and join her for a writing workshop. Who knows. Maybe you’ve got a story that can be an inspiration to someone else too.

☼ Thursday, April 8 @ 3:30 pm – West End (Workshop)
☼ Monday, April 12 @ 4:00 pm – Springville Road (Book signing)
☼ Tuesday, April 20 @ 3:30 pm – West End (Book signing)
☼ Monday, April 26 @ 4:00 pm – Springville Road (Workshop)

For more information about Taylor, visit her site at http://www.chandrasparkstaylor.com/. Also check out her Facebook page at www.facebook.com/booksbychandrasparkstaylor.

Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution





 http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhritz/ /CC BY 2.0Do you pay attention to what you eat? Do you know the origin of those overly processed foods? Jamie Oliver, the acclaimed British chef with a penchant for fresh and flavorful food, has launched a new television program called Jamie's Food Revolution. Jamie believes that the more we know about our food, the wiser choices we'll make, resulting in an improvement in our mood and behavior. He says that we will feel better, think faster and live longer. Jamie is currently conducting a campaign to make sure that every child in America receives fresh and healthy food choices. School lunches are his primary target of reform. He has stated that these lunches are highly processed concoctions of additives, preservatives and fats. He also plans to teach children and adults to prepare fresh, healthy food and reform the cooking habits of overweight adults. Will he be able to accomplish these laudable goals? Just watch this unique and educational program that plans to change the way you think about food. With a little help, we can make wiser food choices, prepare healthier food that will make a dramatic difference in how we look and feel.Please visit your local library to check out books in the following subject areas:Jamie's CookbooksFoodHealthBe sure to visit the Central Business, Science and Technology Department for more information. They have an outstanding science and health collection. The library has created a Nutrition Subject Guide that contains outstanding resources.Visit the Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution Website for full episodes, recipes and show information.

Tree Planting Ceremony to Honor Anne Frank





“We both looked up to the blue sky, the horse chestnut whose bare branches glittered with droplets, the gulls and the other birds that seemed made of silver as they swooped by.” Anne Frank, February 23, 1944On Sunday, April 11, a horse chestnut tree will be planted to symbolize how the courage of those who faced harsh intolerance has inspired our community’s growth into acceptance and hope.  The tree is similar to one described by Anne Frank, a German-Jewish teenager who was forced to go into hiding during the Holocaust, as she gazed out the window of the room where she hid with her family for almost three years.A dedicatory plaque will be inscribed with Anne Frank’s words:  “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.”  Five Birmingham organizations join together to make this dedication titled “Roots of Courage; Branches of Hope” a program of remembrance and renewal.For more information on this program visit BPL's Press Room.Details"Roots of Courage; Branches of Hope" ceremonyKelly Ingram ParkSunday, April 111:00 p.m.
