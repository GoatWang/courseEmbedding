Seasoned executive to lead international commercialization


SUNNYVALE, CA, June 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ - Viveve, Inc., a privately held
 woman's health company, has announced the appointment of Patricia
 Scheller as Chief Executive Officer.  In addition to this position, Ms.
 Scheller will also serve on Viveve's Board of Directors.


"Patricia Scheller is the perfect leader for the next stage of the
 company's development," stated Brigitte Smith, Viveve's Chairman of the
 Board and Managing Director of GBS Venture Partners. "Viveve is
 pioneering quick and painless non-surgical treatment to address vaginal
 laxity and loss of physical sensation that is common to many women
 after vaginal childbirth.  Patricia's experience in building global new
 businesses and establishing strong market franchises will help position
 the company and technology for rapid market adoption.  Her impressive
 track record of successful product introductions, coupled with her
 management and strategic development expertise, will position Viveve
 for market success."


Ms. Scheller has more than 25 years of executive marketing, business
 development and managerial experience within the health care industry.
 Most recently she served as CEO of Prescient Medical, Inc., a privately
 held company focused on the development of diagnostic and treatment
 products designed to reduce deaths from heart attacks.  Prior to
 working at Prescient Medical, she was the CEO of SomaLogic, Inc., a
 biotechnology company focused on the development of diagnostic products
 using aptamer technology.  In addition, she has managed several
 business units of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson
 company, and held several senior positions at Dade Behring, Inc.  While
 at Dade Behring, Inc., she directed the commercialization of the hsCRP
 diagnostic test, a screening test for systemic inflammation, which has
 been shown to increase the risk of heart attacks.  The hsCRP test was
 the first diagnostic test added to the cardiac test panel by the Center
 for Disease Control and Prevention and American Heart Association in
 over 30 years.  As Director of cardiology systems at Cordis Corporation
 (a Johnson & Johnson company) she managed the launch of the first
 Palmaz-Schatz® balloon-expandable coronary stent, the first major
 product entry into what became a $6 billion market.


"The Viveve technology has the potential to improve the lives of women
 all over the world," explained Ms. Scheller.  "I'm looking forward to
 working with the dedicated team at Viveve and clinicians around the
 world to create widespread awareness of the company's groundbreaking
 technology and establishing Viveve as a leader in the women's health
 market."

                                            DeForest - Patti Schaller, age 58, of Vienna, WI, passed away unexpectedly at her home on Friday, December 2nd, 2016.

Patti was born September 18, 1958 in Milwaukee, WI to La Verne and Andy Anderson and was a beloved step-daughter to Fay Anderson after the passing of La Verne.  She will live on forever in the hearts of her husband, Bob, and siblings Connie, Rick (Cass), Mimi (Steve), Ron, Edi (Bob), and Jody (Renea) along with members of the Schaller family including Cita and Bob, Tom, Mark, Richard (Ronda), Mike (Teresa), Scott (Teresa), Debra (Mark) and Lynda and dozens of cousins, aunts and uncles, as well as numerous nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews who will miss Auntie Patti's laughter, love, and warmth.

Patti attended St. Mary's Czestochowa grade school in Milwaukee until moving with her family to Crivitz, WI in 1972.  She graduated from Crivitz High School in 1976, and graduated from UW-Oshkosh with a four-year nursing degree in 1980. She used her nursing degree to work at Winnebago Mental Health Institute before settling at Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison where she worked for 34 years until retiring in 2015.   It was at Mendota that Patti met the love of her life, Bob Schaller, and married him in Madison, WI on November 2, 1991, enjoying 25 years of love and adventure.

Patti loved the outdoors.  Some of her many escapades included sailing, kayaking, motorcycling, ATV riding, snow skiing, biking, star gazing, hiking, snowshoeing, gardening, love of music and Beatle Jams and most importantly, her cats.  Any living creature in nature was safe around Patti--especially dragonflies. 

Patti will not only be missed by family and friends, but anyone who was lucky enough to have met her.  Her infectious personality could light up a room, and would ignite an ember of joy in a person that would continue to grow and glow long after parting.

Family and friends may visit at Winn-Cress Funeral Home, 5785 Hwy Q, Waunakee, on Friday, Dec. 16, 2016 from 4pm - 7pm.

Patti is a beautiful light and energy that will remain with all of us forever. She has been an educator, a supportive shoulder, an inspiration, a wonderful and compassionate nurse, and a light unto our path. I will most miss her fun loving joy for life. My heart is saddened by her earthly loss but delighted with the opportunity to have known her. Bobby: know that Patti's light and grace lives on in you, always and forever.

Anyone who knew her could not help but  have anything but the fondest memories.  Patti was always one of my favorite people.  I will always cherish memories of the rides and times we all had together.  I wish I could be there in person to extend my sincerest condolences to you and  the Schaller and Anderson families.  Know that you are in our thoughts.

Playing in the Couples golf outing at Woodland Ridge and the fun I had singing with Patti in the clubhouse after one of those outings while she played the tambourine. Also the way she vigilantly took care of her brother Jody when he was injured and in the hospital. You are missed Patti. God bless and RIP.  Bob and the entire family are in our thoughts and prayers.

Patti was a truly wonderful and remarkable lady, and I loved working with her and Bob! I will always remember sharing and enjoying live camera feeds of birds, bears and wolves with Patti and of her love for all forms of life including the countless insects that she rescued from various offices in the administration building!  I will also always remember your smiling face and cheerful attitude.  You made this world a brighter and happier place for all who encountered you.  I will miss the talks that we shared in your office as well as your wit and charm!  You and Bob made a fantastic couple, and the memories you created will last forever!
