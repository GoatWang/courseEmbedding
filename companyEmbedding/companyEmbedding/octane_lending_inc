What Our Dealers Say About Us
Octane Lending has dramatically improved our ability to get customers approved quickly and fixed the problem for duplicate data entry.  Octane Lending has also done an outstanding job at helping us find new lenders to get more customers bought.  We’re looking forward to a long relationship!
Brandon KnoxBusiness Managerhttp://www.midsouthmotoplex.com/ – Mid-South Motoplex
Octane Lending makes submitting credit applications so much easier, as you type it in once and send to multiple lenders. Octane works hard to find alternate financing for customers who need a little help with their credit and they are always willing to help if you have a question.
Linda RizzonF&I Managerhttp://rizzoncycle.com/ – Rizzon Cycle
Not having to re-key information to different lenders saves us time and Mark & Michael are always there to help me if I have any questions!
Carry M.F&I Managerhttp://www.romneycycles.com/ – Romney Cycles
I love using Octane Lending. The new application entry procedure is great, keep up the good work!

Job Description



We are looking for a Product Manager to help lead and execute product design across the full product life-cycle. This is an opportunity to make an profound impact and shape the product of a rapidly growing venture backed startup. You will work closely with our sales & marketing team to identify product insights and with our CPO to plan, design, and test.
Octane Lending has raised ~$28M in equity and $95M in debt capital and currently focuses on the powersports market (e.g., motorcycle, ATV/UTV) where limited competition and technologically antiquated incumbents provide an opportunity to originate attractive loans. Our Octane software provides a streamlined underwriting/origination experience and, through our subsidiary Roadrunner Financial, we provide sponsored financing for 16 manufacturer partners including Bombardier, Suzuki, Textron, Piaggio, and Triumph.
The incoming Product Manager will lead initiatives across the entire product life-cycle including analyzing client feedback, proposing new features, creating wire frames, and designing UI/UX mockups. Four years product manager / UI/UX experience would be ideal.

What We're Building




Hello!  We are Octane Lending, a fast-growing fintech startup in New York City tackling the inefficiencies of consumer lending. Our flagship technology, the Octane Marketplace, boosts merchants' sales by enabling customers to procure financing — quickly, in shop, and without paperwork — from lenders across the entire FICO spectrum.  On the back end, the Octane Loan Origination System gives lenders access to a wide merchant base and equips loan officers to operate at scale, automatically scoring all incoming applications and providing a state-of-the-art streamlined deal-closing process.  Customers benefit because we help them afford their dream products, merchants love us because we help them quickly close more deals, and lenders are lining up to be our partners because we bring them new, scaleable business.

My son was auditioning on a small level for projects though his drama program.  He got a few good gigs and almost landed Ryan Gossling film project.  I thought  may be my son may have something.  Went to Take 3, he was signed and they sent him out on many great audition even with out professional head shot.  When we went out on auditions we saw all of these great head shots and realized  when you represent an agency you must be professional and get the proper photos and that is what we did, we were never pushed!   I was pleased and felt well taken care of.  They didn't push any photog on me or acting lessons, but Natasha said if you feel frustrated and aren't getting the rolls or call backs may be you need to go and look for acting programs that will help. I found that to be completely reasonable, heck that goes without saying!  If acting is what you really want to do then you must work on your craft. We also did model management site and the day after I payed the fee for my son to be apart of the site he landed a gig with Filip phone.  The fact is landing a gig falls ultimately on the client.  Take 3 can't give you a job, the casting directors do and I understand that.  My son hasn't booked anything big, but has gotten call backs which to me says a lot.  The work they do isn't easy.  They submitt tons of kids I am sure. I remember paying for sites to submit my son for various projects if the casting director doesn't select your photo you don't get audition, it is that simple.  It has nothing to do with agency.  Don't shoot the messenger.  Do your homework go with your gut.  Our contract will be up for renewal in the spring.  It has been slow for us and if things continue in that route I will not sign I will just let it go unless my son wants it badly. I can honestly say Take 3 gave my son a fair shot!  We competed with the best of them for national commercials and many other amazing projects.  He got to experience being on set and filming all day and going on a photo shoot.  It was fun, fair, and honest!Take 3 Talent AgencySandy L. ratedFolks on here with the negative reviews are either feeling slighted in some way because their children didn't get enough casting opportunities or felt some sort of entitlement when their children were given an opportunity by these two agencies but did not see much activity. Well so you know, this is because they weren't chosen by the production companies or didn't fall into a certain demo. Not all ages are as popular and not all looks are as demanding. Take it from a parent of kids working with Take 3 - These negative reviews are without merit and should not be taken seriously. We have been with Take 3 for some time and have never been asked for a dime. If your child makes money, they make money - PERIOD. They work at all hours of the day and we've received last minute go-see calls in the middle of the night. They're always on their A game. Slandering a company's name will not make the situation any better. Bottom line is that if you're not happy somewhere, take your chances elsewhere. Burning bridges will not make things right and these agencies all know each other so in the long run you will only be harming your child's chances. Take 3 and its representatives are 5 stars all the way! Keep doing a phenomenal job! Take 3 Talent AgencyAimee H. ratedWe have been in contact and kn...We have been in contact and knowledgeable about PRODUCT/TAKE 3 TALENT for 6 years now and have nothing, but good things to say about them!  First, and foremost- the parents who are saying they were scammed are more or less unknowledgeable when it comes to this industry.  You were NOT scammed because you chose to pay ten dollars to send a digital request to an agency (TAKE 3) to have them view your child for potential representation.  They get thousands of submissions a week which requires them to hire someone to look through all of these submissions-there is where your ten dollar fee comes into play! Most agencies do not even offer the convenience of online submissions-you would have to know someone to get an appointment or pay hundreds of dollars to attend a showcase with 50/100 other children present! If you do not hear anything back from them  in their two week specified period (and I think it states right on the site-we will contact you within two weeks if we are INTERESTED) they simply were not interested in your child~ NO scam about it. I have three children and they have been with different agents-two other BIG NYC agents so I have had experience with model/talent agencies and TAKE 3 really is top notch!Take 3 Talent AgencyPeter O. ratedWhomever has accused Take 3 Talent as being a scam sound like  disgruntled, unknowledgeable  asses.  My son has been represented by Take 3 Talent for almost 2 years & Natasha, Chelsea & Eddie have NEVER, EVER suggested or 'required' him to pay for any classes....even though he is  a newbie. Take 3 has sent him out on so many wonderful auditions & as such, he has booked a commercial & received a few callbacks. My son has improved so much  & has had so much fun because of the wonderful opportunities afforded to us by Take 3 Talent. Success does not happen overnight, it is a very gradual process & we are very happy that the patient, kind  & always professional team of Take 3 Talent believe in my son & are always available to help him.  We are looking forward to future opportunities to grow & succeed as my son continues to flourish thanks to the expert representation & tutelage of the team of Take 3 Talent.  Thank you. Devyn&Julian O'Neill .. non employees of Take 3 Talent.Take 3 Talent Agencysjaycoleman ratedI dont know who you all are saying all these NEGATIVE things about Product Model Management. All 3 of my kids are with them and we have never been asked to pay a dime for classes or anything. NO I AM NOT AN EMPLOYEE I am a mom that lives in Philly and drives her children to NY almost every day for shoots and auditions. Product is AWESOME the agents are great!!! AKA NATE THE GREAT!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM!!! if they asked ur kids to take classes obviously your kids werent all they GREAT!! Take a hint for all the parents that think its a scam ITS SO NOT they are totally legit U and ur kids are just losers thats allOne Source TalentJay M. ratedOST has been a major influence in assisting the forward mobility of my acting and modeling career. Since being accepted to OST in June I have worked in a feature film that has been accepted into Sundance FIlm Festival, I have had a successful audition for a television pilot- we are shooting the first scenes of episode 1 next month. And I have been requested as a runway model for Remember the Times Fashion Show. Dreams do not happen overnight but OST definitely has provided a bridge to help me get to where I know I belong. Thank you.One Source Talentbeckyne4 ratedThe people that worked there were nice. The building was kind of annoying... way too contemporary, felt like I was in a night club, but they know their stuff. The lady I spoke with informed me all about the people they have helped and if you truly take advantage of the auditions and castings they connect you with then you should have no shortage of acting/modeling gigs.Take 3 Talent Agencynatalie.maguire.5 ratedI've been signed with Take 3 Talent for almost a year now and I'm really pleased. They have been nothing but kind and supportive, and they've gotten me some fantastic auditions. I've made good relationships with casting directors, and other people of the biz. I've learned a ton and I've been having fun doing it! Take 3 Talent AgencyJane H. ratedWe have been with this agency since 2014 and find them to be very professional. My son is sent on quality auditions and you can't ask for more than that. The rest is up to us .
