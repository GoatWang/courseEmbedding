Corporate history[edit]
The company was founded in 2005 as Violin Technologies by Donpaul Stephens and Jon Bennett in Iselin, New Jersey.[citation needed] Series A financing valued over $10 million was raised in 2010. Two more rounds of financing in 2011 raised an additional $75 million. Corporate investors included Juniper Networks and Toshiba America Electronic Components (TAEC). It was based in Mountain View, California around this time.
Series D financing of $80 million in March 2012 was led by SAP Ventures (arm of SAP AG), and included Highland Capital, GSV and others. The reported valuation was over $800 million.[2][3]
Violin Memory's initial public offering in September 2013, raised $162 million at a price of $9 a share.[4][4] Its stock price dropped to $2 a share after its largest partner, Hewlett Packard, became a competitor and due to concerns of how quickly it was spending money.[4] The company experienced losses of $34 million the following year and the board called for the resignation of the CEO.[5] Additionally, five shareholder lawsuits were filed against the company, alleging it did not disclose the financial impact expected from a federal shutdown.[4] In December 2013 the company terminated CEO Basile,[6] replacing him with Kevin DeNuccio in February 2014.[7]
The New York Stock Exchange de-listed Violin Memory shares in October 2016 because its market capitalization had fallen below $15 million.[8] A few days later it changed to be traded on the OTC Markets Group exchange OTCQX, using the same VMEM symbol.[9] In November 2016, it was valued at $3.7 million.[7]
On April 24 2017, Violin announced in a press release that they had emerged from bankruptcy, and had been purchased by Quantum Partners LP, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC.[10]
Technology[edit]
Violin Memory does not use solid state drives (SSD), but instead uses a proprietary design referred to as flash fabric architecture (FFA).[11] The FFA technology consists of: a mesh of NAND flash dies, modules[12] that organize the mesh of flash dies, and a proprietary switched architecture for fault tolerance.[13] In September 2011 Violin announced the 6000 series all-silicon shared flash memory storage arrays.[14]
vMOS[15][16] is Violin Memory’s software layer that integrates with the FFA to provide data protection, management and connectivity to the host.
Products[edit]
The Violin 7000 series includes application aware snapshots, continuous data protection, synchronous replication, asynchronous replication and metro cluster functionality.[17][18][19]
On December 1, 2015 the Violin Memory FSP 7250 and 7600 were announced. The Violin FSP 7250 was marketed as an entry level point product.[20]
The 7700[21] series can scale up to ten 6000 or 7000 series arrays for up to 700TB of raw capacity or 3.5 PB with deduplication[22]
The Violin 6000 series[23] all flash arrays include the 6600, 6200 and 6100. The 6600[24] is based on SLC flash and offers 17.5TB of capacity. The 6200[25] offers flash performance at capacities from 17.5 to 70TB. The 6100[26] is a smaller array at lower price of entry with a pay as you grow[27] option.
The Windows Flash Array (WFA) announced in 2014,[28] uses Microsoft’s Storage Server 2012 R2 instead of vMOS. Jointly developed with Microsoft, the WFA supports Microsoft’s SMB Direct protocol, marketed as network-attached storage.[29]

Violin Memory does not use solid state drives (SSD), but instead uses a proprietary design referred to as flash fabric architecture (FFA).[11] The FFA technology consists of: a mesh of NAND flash dies, modules[12] that organize the mesh of flash dies, and a proprietary switched architecture for fault tolerance.[13] In September 2011 Violin announced the 6000 series all-silicon shared flash memory storage arrays.[14]
vMOS[15][16] is Violin Memory’s software layer that integrates with the FFA to provide data protection, management and connectivity to the host.
Products[edit]
The Violin 7000 series includes application aware snapshots, continuous data protection, synchronous replication, asynchronous replication and metro cluster functionality.[17][18][19]
On December 1, 2015 the Violin Memory FSP 7250 and 7600 were announced. The Violin FSP 7250 was marketed as an entry level point product.[20]
The 7700[21] series can scale up to ten 6000 or 7000 series arrays for up to 700TB of raw capacity or 3.5 PB with deduplication[22]
The Violin 6000 series[23] all flash arrays include the 6600, 6200 and 6100. The 6600[24] is based on SLC flash and offers 17.5TB of capacity. The 6200[25] offers flash performance at capacities from 17.5 to 70TB. The 6100[26] is a smaller array at lower price of entry with a pay as you grow[27] option.
The Windows Flash Array (WFA) announced in 2014,[28] uses Microsoft’s Storage Server 2012 R2 instead of vMOS. Jointly developed with Microsoft, the WFA supports Microsoft’s SMB Direct protocol, marketed as network-attached storage.[29]

Kevin DeNuccio
Thanks, Cory. And good afternoon, everyone.
Revenues for the quarter were $7.5 million versus $9.7 million in prior quarter and $15.3 million a year ago. This quarter's performance is obviously frustrating and disappointing as we strongly believe it could be the quarter that returns revenue upward after a downward trend for more than a year. Both of our international theaters in the EMEA and APAC had extremely difficult product sales in the quarter. The international markets alone could account for a short fall from expectations.
For North America, we did see several customers expand their initial deployment of the FSP platform. However, the overall performance in the U.S. and for the company overall was primarily caused by our inability to close significant orders in time from our key Fortune 100 customers. Two of our top five customers have been testing or evaluating our new family of products, which were not available for revenue last quarter. We are on those products in a minute.
But this was a contributing factor in us not being able to generate product revenue with two of our top customers. Our target market of large Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies makes orders naturally large and lumpy and challenging in terms of long sales cycles. And it's been a large part of our inability to consistently execute or return to growth. Bottom line is that it was a very tough quarter for us.

So, let me turn the conversation to what it means for the company going forward. We still believe Violin is on verge of reversing our revenue trend and heading upward. With this in mind we also believe several changes are necessary to accelerate the company's return to growth and enable long-term success. Most importantly Violin must retain our customer confidence in both our long-term plans and viability as a strategic technology provider.
I'd like to lay out the important pillars for our success going forward. First, is about Violin's technology leadership, disruptive innovation, and software maturity, which we believe can be the most important factors to renew revenue growth. We are on the verge of announcing a next generation family of Flash Storage Platform comprised of industry leading All Flash Arrays. The announcement is scheduled for next week on September 14, 2016.
We believe these new products will once again establish Violin as the leader in the combination of every category measured in AFAs; latency, affordability, density, scalability and performance. As it relates to eye-offs, Violin is doubling the performance of its current arrays while driving a five-fold improvement and consistent low latency while offering significant density and the lowest cost currently available.
We'll also announce the general availability of encryption software related to security that will make the Violin arrays the most secure storage arrays in the industry irrespective of whether data is in flight or at rest. This capability will be available on our legacy systems, as well as our new line of arrays.
We will also roll out of our vision and initial products around cloud storage, which will position the Violin's Flash Storage Platform as the best product line for building private, hybrid, and public clouds by leveraging Violin's newest market innovation for seamlessly integrating and communicating between these environments.
The offering of Concerto in the cloud will allow customers the ability to use any public cloud as a backup site disaster recovery or fail-over site or even use the cloud as a second or third tier of lower performance storage. All of these capabilities will be usable and accessible without any changes to any other public clouds, such as AWS, Azure or Google. 
And all managed from Violin's company management suite that enables a single pane of glass to be used to manage and organize customer data leveraging the Concerto operating system. We've achieved this by virtualizing Concerto, allowing it to run seamlessly and virtual machine in the cloud.
We feel the seamless private, public cloud integration is unique and strategic as large enterprises aggressively move to private, hybrid, and public cloud implementations. While enterprises have been migrating data and after the cloud over the last several years the coordination management and/or retrieval challenges of data have been very difficult. The Concerto in the cloud solution will address this customer pinpoint.
This announcement is a massive delivery of technology leadership and innovation and it demonstrates Violin's commitment to deliver technology leadership for its customers. This technology leadership is one of the key pillars for Violin's turnaround and a key tenant for the company's long-term successes.
As I just mentioned every two of our Fortune 100 customer order delays from last quarter were related to waiting for delivery of the new Flash Storage Platforms features and functionality. At the launch we will also discuss the company's vision for next generation technology such as NVMe over Fabrics.
I encourage you to go to our website to register to attend the September 14 product launch and vision webcast.
The second pillar of a long term viability and success as do with continuing to improve Violin's operational efficiencies overall cost structure and time to breakeven point. With our return to revenue growth taking much longer than we anticipated, we are attempting to build the most efficient organization possible to create longevity in our time to complete our turnaround.

Today we are announcing that we are broadening the responsibilities of Ebrahim Abbasi, our Chief Operating Officer. Ebrahim will assume sales and marketing responsibilities for the business in addition to his current responsibilities in R&D, customer support and manufacturing operations.
Said Ouissal, will be focused on transitioning sales and field operations responsibilities to Ebrahim and will assume his strategy position reporting directly to me. This is also part of reducing and taking a layer of management out of our senior ranks more appropriate to the size of the business.
Ebrahim has been key and leading the maturing and stabilizing actions of Violin’s product development, particularly to Concerto operating system over the last year, and he’s credited with leading a successful delivery of the new FSP products to be announced next week, while also driving Violin’s lower expense structure.
Ebrahim has always spent a lot of time in the field with customers and we believe his aggressive always upbeat positive attitude that is infectious, and have an impact we need to reinvigorating sales and customer confidence with the launch of the new products. And of course with my background of 25 years in sales, I will be intimately involved due to the critical importance of returning Violin to revenue growth.
In addition to the above actions, Violin also announced last quarter the opening of our first low cost R&D site in Kiev Ukraine in conjunction with our partner GlobalLogic. We've currently ramped to 20 developers with our intention to ramp to 50 by year end. This is a key element in our strategy to have the lowest cost structure in the industry without sacrificing our ability to keep our pace of innovation and technology leadership. Violin's remote R&D site will give the company the ability to scale at a significantly lower cost structure.
The third pillar to achieve success and viability for our customers and shareholders will be tightly managing both our cash on hand, and our ability to continue raising additional funding to address the company's projected losses through the profitability. This is where I'll be spending most of my immediate time.
In this regard, we finished last quarter with $36 million in cash after a $13 million cash burn in Q2. We believe our cost cutting and streamlining strategy will achieve a quarterly expense rate of under $11.5 million by Q1 over a 50% reduction from Q4 last year. This should reduce our quarterly burn to approximately $5 million at the beginning of the year from $13 million last quarter.
The impact of this will give us the lowest breakeven point of any of our public peers to between $70 million and $80 million in annual revenue. We believe that achieving this level of cash burn places us in the best position to obtain the necessary funding to continue to finance the business.
We are currently talking to both strategic and financial sponsors to address our need to raise capital and the overall financial structure of the company. We announced the filing of a shelf registration during last quarter for 20% of our outstanding shares.
Bruce Grant our largest shareholder and newest board member is leading this effort with me. Bruce continues to show his support and belief in the company. He will also continue to have open discussions with our bondholders in order to maximize the success and value creation of the business as we build towards profitability.
As I talk to customers and investors, I explain the difference and arbitrage between Wall Street evaluations of a company - in the Silicon Valley evaluation of a company. Wall Street primarily values financial metrics such as revenue growth, earnings or PEs, as well as cash user needs, the peer that we are paying the price for being public.

Where Silicon Valley values technology creation, differentiation, market opportunity and human talent, in this Silicon Valley regard, Violin remains an extremely valuable company with many of the best assets in an industry that is an enormous disruption and with incredible opportunity. And while it is very painful to navigate the Violin turnaround publicly, it gives our customers the ultimate transparency far above any private company or start-up or a comparison to our few public peers for using enormous burn rates to achieve their growth.
If it wasn't validated in this belief and what we offer to customers, one would have to believe that no startup could ever make it. I think one of the things the team and I underestimated with the difficulty and time needed in getting enterprise class maturity, reliability and customer confidence in a our comprehensive Concerto operating system.
Concerto operating is the broadest set of data services available in the industry in a native AFA operating system. It is Concerto that not only delivers always functionality but allows us to offer the first 69 Architecture in all-flash arrays. This architecture was formally only available in high-end legacy disk product such as EMC VMAX.
One other thing we spent - the last year focused is on hardening and maturing Concerto to deliver on the Flash Storage Platform 69 Architecture. And along with the launch of all the new FSP products, we will be delivering the latest release of Concerto version 7.6 that we have been hardening since last September.
As you know we are competing in a very different segment of the market in a public peers as we target the largest Global 1000 and Fortune 500 enterprises in almost critical application with this first last phase 69 Architecture. It’s been challenging for us because this Global 1000 business is big, lumpy and conservative around critical applications essential for their business.
However, as these mega franchises consisting of Fortune 500 and Global 1000 expand their Violin roll up to full production, we believe they will produce large ongoing revenue stream, that can serve as the foundation for the company’s growth and success.
Now I would also like to share some comments on the market and competition, as a competition is fierce. In 2016 the industry saw flash main streaming across the storage landscape, a position Violin staked out 18 months ago when the company first launched the Flash Storage Platform. We positioned our product and service capabilities along with our company mindset to enter into this largest segment in market opportunity.
We’ve seen a much change in competition over the last couple of quarters due to the mainstreaming of the market for flash. This is most notable with the biggest competitors in the business now reverting back to legacy architectures dust fully with SSDs and away from the acquired all-flash array platform. We believe this is primarily due to two factors. First, is the market need to go back to the full suite of features and functionality required in large enterprise primary storage market and applications.
This need consist of a completely integrated suite of features and reliability profile that is available in the FSP today. It's important to note that this tightly integrated offering is not available in any other startup or legacy competitor that offers in all-flash array.
The second factor is that raw flash cost curve level is defending fast enough that its becoming possible to meet competitive price point without e-duplication technology, which has been central for making flash affordable versus disk over the last couple of years.
We believe this cost reduction will further accelerate flash adoption in environments that are not well suited for e-duplication as they can simply migrate traditional second pin launch to flash to accelerate data base and high performance applications.

This is a segment where Violin first made its mark and had early success. Now with this broader market segment coming of age to flash and with Violin's continued innovation, Violin should once again be able to drive market adoption and success by serving the needs of these customers.
We still have many challenges to return to growth and complete our turnaround and with the pillars I laid out for our success above along with our structural changes, we are focused on our execution and the ability to be successful for our customers, investors and employees going forward.
Cory will now provide his remarks on our financial results.
Cory Sindelar
Thank you, Kevin.
Revenue for the first quarter was $7.5 million, a decrease of 23% sequentially from revenue of $9.7 million for the first quarter and a decrease of 51% from the year ago period, this result was below our guidance of $11 million to $13 million for the quarter.
Our total revenue 77% came from the Americas which is up from 70% last quarter. EMEA was 17% about the same as last quarter and Asia was down to 6% from 15% last quarter. We had two new customers down from seven in the prior quarter and new customers accounted for approximately 2% of our total revenue down from nearly 10% last quarter. And transactions direct with end user customers were about 34% of total revenue as compared with 28% last quarter.
Our GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 3% as compared to 40% in the prior quarter. This was due to an inventory write-off, in light of our material reduction in sales - product sales relative to our forecast and the pending new product introduction we estimated that we have more inventory than needed to cover our forecasted sales for the current platform over the next 12 months. Based on this analysis we took an accounting charge of $2.9 million in the quarter. We still have the opportunity to sell these units in time like we have done with our 6000 Series products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter improved to 44% which compares to 42% last quarter and was below our guidance of 45% to 50%. The increase in gross margin versus prior quarter was due to the fact that service margin - our service revenue which is at higher gross margins was a larger percentage of total revenue.
Operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $19.1 million for the second quarter, which is down from $24.4 million for the first quarter.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were lower by $2.3 million to $16.5 million as compared to $18.8 million in the first quarter, and were within our guidance of $16 million to $17 million. The decrease in expenses was the result of our restructuring that occurred in early March to align spending of revenue as we previously shared. We continue to restructure our operations to take expenses out.
As Kevin mentioned, we began an outsourcing project early in the second quarter, once fully implemented we expect this program will saves us $5 million annually. We expect the transition to be completed by the end of our fiscal year.
Total headcount at the end of the second quarter was 235, as compared to 258 at the end of the first quarter and to 318 at the end of last fiscal year. The decrease primarily relates to a reduction in our sales and marketing organization and to a lesser extent R&D.
Sales and marketing headcount at the end of the quarter was 78 versus 89 last quarter and engineering was 99 versus 108 last quarter. If you include the 20 plus developers we have on staff with GlobalLogic, our engineering workforce is greater than the prior quarter.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $31.4 million and we had negative cash flows from operations of $13.5 million for the second quarter, which is on the low side of our guidance of $13 million to $15 million. For the six months ended July 31, 2016 we utilize $32.2 million of our cash to fund our operations.

Based on our current expectations for revenue in gross margin, we believe our existing cash balance is insufficient to operate the business for the next 12 months even as we continue to restructure our operations and reduce spending even further. As Kevin has mentioned, we are actively seeking additional cap further to fund our operations.
Since the end of the second quarter we have reduced our headcount by approximately 15%. We currently believe that our non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter will be between $15 million and $16 million.
We have decided not to provide quarterly guidance for at least the next two quarter as we are undergoing a lot of change including organizational changes and new product launch and reductions in our cost structure. Until we have better visibility we believe providing quarterly guidance will not be practical.
I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing.
Kevin DeNuccio
Thanks, Cory.
We learned a lot over the last couple of years and we are taking these learnings including those from our mistakes and making the necessary adjustments. We strongly believe that the Flash Storage Platform including the new arrays we are unveiling on September 14, the maturity of the Concerto software and finally our new cloud strategy produce a successful outcome for our employees, customers and investors.
I will now turn the call over to Cory to begin the Q&A.
Cory Sindelar
Operator, please compile the queue for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi
Yes. Hi, thanks. Shared a frustration by the way. Can you talk - I got personal questions as well, by the way. So let me know, so that I may get back into the queue. But first do you have an update on OEM partnership front?
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes. I mean, the biggest one that we have been working with - we are going to gauge in European theater primarily and couple of big opportunities in the U.S. But I think generally that relationship is not really done to the place where it's really producing any meaningful revenue and I'm not sure it's going in the next quarter or two either.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay. The breakeven model described 70 million, 80 million is your breakeven target and did I hear it correctly that the OpEx rate once the new rationalization of the OpEx structure will be $11 million per quarter, is that correct?
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes. Under 11.5, that's right.
Nehal Chokshi
Under 11.5, okay. So I back-out that that implies total gross margin profile of about 40% is that correct? And then I have follow-up based on that answer.
Kevin DeNuccio
No, I think that it's going to be - we think margins will be more in the 50% to 60% range probably at that time frame.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay.
Cory Sindelar
The interest as well.
Nehal Chokshi
I see. Okay.
Cory Sindelar
Operating expenses interest as well and I think that will get you to kind of what's the number…
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes, it’ll get you about the 5 million, yes.
Nehal Chokshi
Got it, okay. That's good. All right. So now regarding the new product that you're going to be - is it going to be released partly GA next week or you just introducing it next week?
Kevin DeNuccio
No, it's shipping starting next week GA, then in data.
Nehal Chokshi
Got it, okay. Now you described that part of the struggle was returning to the revenue ramp was proving that Concerto had a maturity that the large enterprises demand and there was hardening process associated with the Flash Storage Platforms?
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes.
Nehal Chokshi
Why shouldn’t there be that same hardening process that you went through on version one of FSP as what you'll be introducing what I'll recall version 2 next week?
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes, that's a good question. The hardening is really been around the operating system which we launched about 18 months ago. So it's been really the process of hardening the OS and not really the, OS’s interaction with the hardware. So that's where our challenges has been, so we really - we launched product about 18 months ago and 12 months ago like last September. We began a strategy of really hardening the software and quality that it's going to be delivered along with the new platforms next week.

So we really took the last year to do some extraordinary things in engineering and QA to get that product to where we think it needed to be for these critical applications that we are targeting in the largest companies. So it's really all around the OS and not the interaction between the new arrays themselves or the older arrays. It's really the operating system itself, which is about 10 million lines of code, and that's where we struggled to really get customer confidence because we are going into these mission critical applications that basically they run the business on, whether it be inventory and retailer, billing, teleco or cable companies those kind of things.
Those are the actual wining and they are coming off of ZMAX, from EMC that have 69's Architecture. So we build the 69 Architecture and it just taken that time to get it hardened and confidence in the customer that they can build the business line.
Nehal Chokshi
Maybe as a frame of reference, what's the incremental million lines of code that you had to implement to introduce the new functionalities that you are going to be introducing next week?
Kevin DeNuccio
Yes, so I think - I don’t have the count of that. The new functionality in it is really all around security and encryption, so that's really the big pieces of code and been added to it. I don’t really have a count of what that was in terms of how much lines of codes have been added, but the rest of the hardening has been really more rearchitecting how the software interacts with each piece of the functionality, but not necessarily more lines of codes, it's cleaning up the architecture so that the interaction was more solid between all of the functionality they have in the OS.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay, great. We can move on to another topic gross margin. So there is a 2.9 million provision for excess and obsolete inventory, is it fair that there was a distribution between some that was excess and some that was obsolete or are they absolutely intertwined?
Cory Sindelar
It's mostly excess. So a portion of that is fully related systems and some of its component parts, but it's not obsolescence and so much as it is excess quantities.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay. And then I think your inventory ticked down less Q-over-Q than the provision that was taken, so I assume that the provision did hit the balance sheet and therefore this does imply that you guys brought in new inventory, is that correct?
Cory Sindelar
Of the provision approximately $2 million of that hit the inventory balance and the other part went into accrued liabilities for component parts that we haven't received in yet.
Nehal Chokshi
I see, okay, all right. So, you didn’t taken any new inventory then basically correct?
Cory Sindelar
Correct.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay, good. And all right - and then that depreciation about $2 million of that, does any of that get record into product COGS.
Cory Sindelar
No, the majority of that would be in R&D.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay. So then it seems like the - it is a real apples-to-apples here that product gross margin did tick down from 25% to 13%. Can you talk about why that was then?
Cory Sindelar
Yes I think if you take a look at kind of the overall product revenue relative to prior quarters, the COGS is going to be a larger percentage of that cost of goods sold and the second thing is obviously pricing in the quarter probably more aggressive as we were trying to pool in as much revenue as possible to close out the quarter.
Nehal Chokshi
Okay. My final question is GlobalLogic deal. Does GlobalLogic retain any IP rights for the development?
Kevin DeNuccio
No.
Nehal Chokshi
Excellent. Thank you.
Operator
And at this time there are no further questions.
Kevin DeNuccio
Well operator then let's go ahead and conclude the call for today. Thank you everybody for joining us.

Corporate history[edit]
The company was founded in 2005 as Violin Technologies by Donpaul Stephens and Jon Bennett in Iselin, New Jersey.[citation needed] Series A financing valued over $10 million was raised in 2010. Two more rounds of financing in 2011 raised an additional $75 million. Corporate investors included Juniper Networks and Toshiba America Electronic Components (TAEC). It was based in Mountain View, California around this time.
Series D financing of $80 million in March 2012 was led by SAP Ventures (arm of SAP AG), and included Highland Capital, GSV and others. The reported valuation was over $800 million.[2][3]
Violin Memory's initial public offering in September 2013, raised $162 million at a price of $9 a share.[4][4] Its stock price dropped to $2 a share after its largest partner, Hewlett Packard, became a competitor and due to concerns of how quickly it was spending money.[4] The company experienced losses of $34 million the following year and the board called for the resignation of the CEO.[5] Additionally, five shareholder lawsuits were filed against the company, alleging it did not disclose the financial impact expected from a federal shutdown.[4] In December 2013 the company terminated CEO Basile,[6] replacing him with Kevin DeNuccio in February 2014.[7]
The New York Stock Exchange de-listed Violin Memory shares in October 2016 because its market capitalization had fallen below $15 million.[8] A few days later it changed to be traded on the OTC Markets Group exchange OTCQX, using the same VMEM symbol.[9] In November 2016, it was valued at $3.7 million.[7]
On April 24 2017, Violin announced in a press release that they had emerged from bankruptcy, and had been purchased by Quantum Partners LP, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC.[10]
Technology[edit]
Violin Memory does not use solid state drives (SSD), but instead uses a proprietary design referred to as flash fabric architecture (FFA).[11] The FFA technology consists of: a mesh of NAND flash dies, modules[12] that organize the mesh of flash dies, and a proprietary switched architecture for fault tolerance.[13] In September 2011 Violin announced the 6000 series all-silicon shared flash memory storage arrays.[14]
vMOS[15][16] is Violin Memory’s software layer that integrates with the FFA to provide data protection, management and connectivity to the host.
Products[edit]
The Violin 7000 series includes application aware snapshots, continuous data protection, synchronous replication, asynchronous replication and metro cluster functionality.[17][18][19]
On December 1, 2015 the Violin Memory FSP 7250 and 7600 were announced. The Violin FSP 7250 was marketed as an entry level point product.[20]
The 7700[21] series can scale up to ten 6000 or 7000 series arrays for up to 700TB of raw capacity or 3.5 PB with deduplication[22]
The Violin 6000 series[23] all flash arrays include the 6600, 6200 and 6100. The 6600[24] is based on SLC flash and offers 17.5TB of capacity. The 6200[25] offers flash performance at capacities from 17.5 to 70TB. The 6100[26] is a smaller array at lower price of entry with a pay as you grow[27] option.
The Windows Flash Array (WFA) announced in 2014,[28] uses Microsoft’s Storage Server 2012 R2 instead of vMOS. Jointly developed with Microsoft, the WFA supports Microsoft’s SMB Direct protocol, marketed as network-attached storage.[29]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Corporate history[edit]
The company was founded in 2005 as Violin Technologies by Donpaul Stephens and Jon Bennett in Iselin, New Jersey.[citation needed] Series A financing valued over $10 million was raised in 2010. Two more rounds of financing in 2011 raised an additional $75 million. Corporate investors included Juniper Networks and Toshiba America Electronic Components (TAEC). It was based in Mountain View, California around this time.
Series D financing of $80 million in March 2012 was led by SAP Ventures (arm of SAP AG), and included Highland Capital, GSV and others. The reported valuation was over $800 million.[2][3]
Violin Memory's initial public offering in September 2013, raised $162 million at a price of $9 a share.[4][4] Its stock price dropped to $2 a share after its largest partner, Hewlett Packard, became a competitor and due to concerns of how quickly it was spending money.[4] The company experienced losses of $34 million the following year and the board called for the resignation of the CEO.[5] Additionally, five shareholder lawsuits were filed against the company, alleging it did not disclose the financial impact expected from a federal shutdown.[4] In December 2013 the company terminated CEO Basile,[6] replacing him with Kevin DeNuccio in February 2014.[7]
The New York Stock Exchange de-listed Violin Memory shares in October 2016 because its market capitalization had fallen below $15 million.[8] A few days later it changed to be traded on the OTC Markets Group exchange OTCQX, using the same VMEM symbol.[9] In November 2016, it was valued at $3.7 million.[7]
On April 24 2017, Violin announced in a press release that they had emerged from bankruptcy, and had been purchased by Quantum Partners LP, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC.[10]
Technology[edit]
Violin Memory does not use solid state drives (SSD), but instead uses a proprietary design referred to as flash fabric architecture (FFA).[11] The FFA technology consists of: a mesh of NAND flash dies, modules[12] that organize the mesh of flash dies, and a proprietary switched architecture for fault tolerance.[13] In September 2011 Violin announced the 6000 series all-silicon shared flash memory storage arrays.[14]
vMOS[15][16] is Violin Memory’s software layer that integrates with the FFA to provide data protection, management and connectivity to the host.
Products[edit]
The Violin 7000 series includes application aware snapshots, continuous data protection, synchronous replication, asynchronous replication and metro cluster functionality.[17][18][19]
On December 1, 2015 the Violin Memory FSP 7250 and 7600 were announced. The Violin FSP 7250 was marketed as an entry level point product.[20]
The 7700[21] series can scale up to ten 6000 or 7000 series arrays for up to 700TB of raw capacity or 3.5 PB with deduplication[22]
The Violin 6000 series[23] all flash arrays include the 6600, 6200 and 6100. The 6600[24] is based on SLC flash and offers 17.5TB of capacity. The 6200[25] offers flash performance at capacities from 17.5 to 70TB. The 6100[26] is a smaller array at lower price of entry with a pay as you grow[27] option.
The Windows Flash Array (WFA) announced in 2014,[28] uses Microsoft’s Storage Server 2012 R2 instead of vMOS. Jointly developed with Microsoft, the WFA supports Microsoft’s SMB Direct protocol, marketed as network-attached storage.[29]

Simplify Your STORAGE
The Violin Flash Storage Platform stores more data in a smaller footprint and drives faster application performance for the same cost as traditional storage. It’s time to make Violin your primary storage.
WHITE PAPER: All Flash Data Center













Maximize CPU Performance


Uses Fewer Rack Units


Cuts Power Consumption




Simplify Your DATA CENTER
The Violin Flash Storage Platform drives efficiencies in CPU and server infrastructures. A Flash Storage Platform takes up less space and consumes less power than old style HDD arrays or Solid State Hard Drive-based hybrids. Simplify the economics of the entire data center.
LEARN MORE








Simplify Your BUSINESS
The Violin Flash Storage Platform closes the processor–storage performance gap. Redeploy resources to development of strategic initiatives and open new business opportunities. The Violin Flash Storage Platform simplifies storage economics, data center economic and business economics. Find out how.
LEARN MORE
























“Violin FSPs combines ease of deployment, reliability, and unsurpassed performance, enabling our company to face the future with confidence. Flash technology, such as the FSP, allowed us to collapse multiple tiers of storage into one, dramatically lowering our data center costs for storage. The choice to go with Violin was an obvious one, as it allowed us to replace nearly all of our legacy disk array architectures and software to be best prepared for our digital future.”
 Viktor Kuzmenko, Head of Systems Administration at Ingosstrakh 






“It’s quite a bit faster than using flash, Fibre Channel and SATA [tiers]. We can stick all our data into flash now. Before we were taking our SAN storage [with disk] and migrating it to SAN storage [with flash]. We were expecting performance improvements, but not this much. I don’t see any reason to turn back [to HDDs].“
Bill Evans, VP of Information Technology at Ferrellgas 








“Most enterprises have at least several applications where extremely low storage latency can directly translate to increased revenues, better customer experience, or differentiated competitive advantage. These applications tend to be transactional, database-driven or real-time analytics workloads where a 500 microsecond latency difference can be directly monetized. For these environments, AFA architecture can matter a great deal in an ability to consistently deliver sub 300μs performance that companies can base their reputation on, regardless of widely varying workloads and operational workflows.”
Eric Burgener, Research Director, Enterprise Storage at IDC






“Violin solved our ERP performance issues at a fraction of the cost of other systems. Not only are we exceeding our business service levels, we project a return on investment of 11 months with the Violin platform.”
Derek Cornwell, IT infrastructure services manager at BlueScope

WHITE PAPER: All Flash Data Center













Maximize CPU Performance


Uses Fewer Rack Units

“Violin FSPs combines ease of deployment, reliability, and unsurpassed performance, enabling our company to face the future with confidence. Flash technology, such as the FSP, allowed us to collapse multiple tiers of storage into one, dramatically lowering our data center costs for storage. The choice to go with Violin was an obvious one, as it allowed us to replace nearly all of our legacy disk array architectures and software to be best prepared for our digital future.”
 Viktor Kuzmenko, Head of Systems Administration at Ingosstrakh 






“It’s quite a bit faster than using flash, Fibre Channel and SATA [tiers]. We can stick all our data into flash now. Before we were taking our SAN storage [with disk] and migrating it to SAN storage [with flash]. We were expecting performance improvements, but not this much. I don’t see any reason to turn back [to HDDs].“
Bill Evans, VP of Information Technology at Ferrellgas 








“Most enterprises have at least several applications where extremely low storage latency can directly translate to increased revenues, better customer experience, or differentiated competitive advantage. These applications tend to be transactional, database-driven or real-time analytics workloads where a 500 microsecond latency difference can be directly monetized. For these environments, AFA architecture can matter a great deal in an ability to consistently deliver sub 300μs performance that companies can base their reputation on, regardless of widely varying workloads and operational workflows.”
Eric Burgener, Research Director, Enterprise Storage at IDC






“Violin solved our ERP performance issues at a fraction of the cost of other systems. Not only are we exceeding our business service levels, we project a return on investment of 11 months with the Violin platform.”
Derek Cornwell, IT infrastructure services manager at BlueScope

Big Data Warehousing
Drive Performance and Scale with Violin All-Flash Arrays 









Data Warehouse
        Most organizations have created data warehouses to track history of customers, vendors, inventory, finances and many other aspects of daily operations. This resource is now being combined with outside data from social media, clickstream data from company websites, marketing data, and other information to build a more complete view of the customers, markets and operations. Deploying your data warehouse on Violin’s Flash Storage Platform means you can achieve high service levels, support future growth, and get the most from your storage investment all at the same cost as legacy enterprise disk solutions.
      






Certified for Microsoft SQL Server Fast Track Data Warehouse
        SQL Server 2012 Fast Track for Violin is the industry’s first all-silicon data warehouse solution. This validated solution combines SQL Server 2012 Enterprise with the unparalleled performance of the Violin Flash Storage Platform, giving you the most efficient hardware for your solution, saving you time and avoiding the potential costs associated with choosing the right technology for your business needs.


Solution Brief: Fast Track Data Warehouse









Certified for Oracle
        Violin’s Flash Storage Platform delivers unbeatable performance for Oracle data warehouses that scales to petabytes of data so you can run multiple, massive databases in a flash. Violin solutions are certified by Oracle for use with Oracle VM, enabling customers that deploy Oracle Linux or Oracle VM on Violin solutions to benefit from streamlined joint support.


Solution Brief: Oracle Databases









Speed that Enables
        Violin’s Flash Storage Platform for data warehousing provides the performance for enterprises that need an exceptionally fast and predictable data warehouse infrastructure. Setup, configuration and management of the storage tier with Violin is significantly faster and simpler than disk, hybrid or SSD-based solutions. Whether your database is Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, or Sybase there is no LUN striping to architect, no separation of data, log and temp space or tiering software to administer and all LUNs perform the same regardless of locality. Such consistency allows CIOs and the technical staff to plan for and maintain performance levels stipulated by an SLA with ease.


Article: Latency Matters









Scale to Petabytes
        With 70TB raw capacity in a single 3U enclosure, Violin solutions enable customers to store upwards of a petabyte of data, even more with compression in a single rack, delivering a data warehousing storage platform that reduces complexity and increasing data loading speeds and efficiency. Customers use Violin’s Flash Storage Platform for petabyte-scale applications and to spread the benefits of Violin’s advanced Flash Fabric Architecture across a range of applications to accelerate their enterprises.

“Violin FSPs combines ease of deployment, reliability, and unsurpassed performance, enabling our company to face the future with confidence. Flash technology, such as the FSP, allowed us to collapse multiple tiers of storage into one, dramatically lowering our data center costs for storage. The choice to go with Violin was an obvious one, as it allowed us to replace nearly all of our legacy disk array architectures and software to be best prepared for our digital future.”
 Viktor Kuzmenko, Head of Systems Administration at Ingosstrakh 






“It’s quite a bit faster than using flash, Fibre Channel and SATA [tiers]. We can stick all our data into flash now. Before we were taking our SAN storage [with disk] and migrating it to SAN storage [with flash]. We were expecting performance improvements, but not this much. I don’t see any reason to turn back [to HDDs].“
Bill Evans, VP of Information Technology at Ferrellgas 








“Most enterprises have at least several applications where extremely low storage latency can directly translate to increased revenues, better customer experience, or differentiated competitive advantage. These applications tend to be transactional, database-driven or real-time analytics workloads where a 500 microsecond latency difference can be directly monetized. For these environments, AFA architecture can matter a great deal in an ability to consistently deliver sub 300μs performance that companies can base their reputation on, regardless of widely varying workloads and operational workflows.”
Eric Burgener, Research Director, Enterprise Storage at IDC






“Violin solved our ERP performance issues at a fraction of the cost of other systems. Not only are we exceeding our business service levels, we project a return on investment of 11 months with the Violin platform.”
Derek Cornwell, IT infrastructure services manager at BlueScope
