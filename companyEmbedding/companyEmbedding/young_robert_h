 Mission Statement: Our mission is to do all we can to change lives and save lives with an alkaline lifestyle and diet.Robert O. Young, MS, D.Sc., Ph.D."Dr. Young may be on the threshold of a new biology, whose principle—if proven—could revolutionize the biology and medicine worlds." Neil Solomon, M.D., Ph.D. Former Head of Research for John Hopkins University.     Over the past two and a half decades, Robert O. Young has been widely recognized as one of the top research scientists in the world. Throughout his career, his research has been focused at the cellular level. Having a specialty in cellular nutrition, Dr. Young has devoted his life to researching the true causes of "disease," subsequently developing "The New Biology™" to help people balance their life.    In 1994, Dr. Young discovered the biological transformation of red blood cells into bacteria and bacteria to red blood cells. He has since documented several such transformations.    Dr. Young's research has been published in several noted journals, including The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. (Sympathetic Resonance Technology, Scientific Foundations and Summary of Biologic and Clinical Studies, Dec. 2002, Vol. 8, No. 6: 835-842.) . He is the author of numerous articles (Herbal Nutrition 1988) and author and co-author of many books including: Herbal Nutritional Medications (1988), One Sickness, One Disease, One Treatment (1992), Sick and Tired (Woodland Publishing, 1995), Back to the House of Health (Woodland Publishing, 1999), The pH Miracle (Warner Books, 2002), The pH Miracle for Diabetes, (Warner Books,2003), Back to the House of Health 2, (Woodland Books, 2003) and The pH Miracle for Weight Loss(Warner Books, 2004) and The pH Miracle: Revised and Updated (Warner Books, 2010) and Reverse Cancer Now (Hikari Publishing, 2014).     The pH Miracle series has sold more than 4.5 million copies. The pH Miracle books have been translated into 27 languages and are gaining a widespread following internationally.    Aside from his work as an author, Dr. Young has been honored to speak at Central University for Nationalities - Beijing (below), China Women's College - Beijing, All-China Women's Federation - Beijing, Brigham Young University, Utah Valley State College, University of Minnesota, University of Hartford, Olin University, Sacred Heart University of Boston, Oxford University - U.K., Harvard University (bottom right), the University of Vienna, and the University of Victoria.    In addition, Dr. Young has been honored with an invitation to sit on the Vegetarian and Fasting Committee for NASA's earth and space missions. He also currently works with a team of research scientists at the University of Puerto Rico, as well as the Center of Diabetes in Puerto Rico, on a potential cure for Type I and Type II diabetes.    Before Dr. Young began his extensive nutritional research, his love for sports and science led him to the University of Utah—where he studied biology and business in the early 70's. There he was granted a full athletic scholarship for tennis. His team was consistently one of the top 10 in the nation. He had the experience of competing with the likes of Stan Smith, Jimmy Connors, and Roscoe Tanner.     In the 80's, following his schooling at the University of Utah, Dr. Young studied medical microbiology—training under Dr. Robert Bradford at the Bradford Research Institute in Chula Vista, California. Dr. Bradford is now a trustee and professor at Capital University in Washington, DC, where he teaches live and dry blood microscopy (www.ability.org.uk/holistic_courses_and_schools.html). Dr. Young also studied darkfield microscopy under Dr. Maria Bleker—who was the prodigy of the great late biologist, Dr. Gunther Enderlein—in Essen, Germany.     In 1993, Dr. Young received a MS in nutrition from the American College in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1995, he received his D.Sc. with emphasis in chemistry and biology. Dr. Young's doctoral dissertation was on Disseminated Intravascular Blood Coagulation and Pathological Blood Coagulation. In 1997, Dr. Young received a Ph.D. from Clayton College of Natural Health. His Professor, James E. Harvey from San Diego State University, reviewed and accepted his dissertation as completing all the requirements for a doctorate of philosophy degree in nutrition. Continuing his studies and research, Dr. Young later received an additional doctorate degree in naturopathy (ND) from Clayton College (1999).     Dr. Young is a member of the Farm Bureau (Membership number C118341) as well as a recognized certified Avocado grower by the California Avocado Commission.    Dr. Young is a member of the American Society of Microbiologists, the American Naturopathic Association, The American Associaiton of Cancer Researchers, an honorary member of the Connecticut Holistic Health Association, the Presidents Council at Brigham Young University, a consultant for InnerLight, Inc., and an advisor to Dean Lawrence Carter at the Martin Luther King Chapel at Morehouse College. He was honored with his wife, Shelley Redford Young, by Professor Lawrence Carter at Morehouse College and inducted into the collegium of scholars as well as placed on the advisory board. Professor Carter made this statement about Dr. Young's work:     "With over 52 books on the market, Dr. Robert O. Young and his wife, Shelley Redford Young, have established themselves as the preeminent scientific researchers on how to balance the body chemistry and achieve one's ideal weight. Every African American and African Caribbean, every person suffering from type I and type II diabetes, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, heart disease and youth obesity, and every person reared on 'soul food' needs to discover The pH Miracle and the rejuvenating recipes that alkalize and energize an over acidified diet.     "I have made this revolutionary dietary paradigm shift an official part of my professional ministry because it eliminated my acid reflux without prescriptions and reduced my weight by 50 pounds in less than two months. This reduction in weight greatly speeded reduction of my PSA level after seeds-implant treatment for low-grade prostate cancer. Dr. Young's nonviolent peace diet is the natural scientific solution for a healthy body that is free from the warring of excess acidity. With Dr. Young's new biology and nutrition program, pastors and congregations will rediscover the miraculous link between nutrition, health and spirituality."     ---The Reverend Dean Lawrence Edward Carter Sr., Ph.D.;Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel;Gandhi Institute for Reconciliation;Founder, Gandhi, King, Ikeda Legacy of Building Peace Exhibition;Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia    Dr Young has been the keynote speaker at medical and health gatherings all over the world and appeared as a guest on many national radio and television shows. In 2002, he and his wife appeared on CBS's The Early Show. Some of his most notable accomplishments include: developer of a new theoretical paradigm called the Mycozymian Theory; pioneer in the research of a biological process called Pleomorphism; and the discoverer of the etiology of diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, and many other diseases.    Dr. Robert Young has devoted his career to the discovery of the missing pieces necessary to complete the larger picture of health.Educational Accreditation for Dr. Young  US Department of Education (ED)   Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)   North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).

Her work provides the practical application of the alkalizing principles contained in the research of her husband, Dr. Robert O. Young.  By providing appropriate tools and knowledge, Shelley is empowering people to take their health into their own, proactive hands.  Her knowledge of the effects of diet on health matters extends beyond her expertise as an author and chef. She is also a Licensed Lymphatic Massage Therapist (LMT) and is trained in microscopic procedures. With a deep awareness of the dangers of the present-day acidic diet and its relationship to the epidemic of various diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer in both adults and especially children, she is forever looking to find the most creative ways to make an energizing and alkalizing diet more appetizing, delicious and attractive to the masses. As a result, she has authored two recipe books: Back to the House of Health: Rejuvenating Recipes to Alkalize and Energize for Life! and Back to the House of Health 2. She also co-authored with her husband, Dr. Robert O. Young, four other books: Sick and Tired? Reclaim Your Inner Terrain,The pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health, The pH Miracle for Diabetes: The Revolutionary Diet Plan for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetics, and The pH Miracle for Weight Loss.  Shelley realizes that when faced with changing our diet and lifestyle, one of the first things we want to know is, “what can I eat?” Therefore, as a master alkalarian chef—as she is being called by her fans—she shares her delicious alkalizing vegetarian recipes and teaches alkalarian food preparation.Shelley Young’s knowledge of the effects of diet on our health extends beyond her expertise as a book author and chef. As a licensed lymphatic massage therapist (LMT) and trained microscopist, Shelley lectures on the lymphatic system and its important role in the body. She is acclaimed for her seminars on how emotions affect our pH balance, as well as her presentations on the latest nutritional research. Both are popular events at the pH miracle retreats that she and her husband host at their beautiful avocado ranch—Rancho Del Sol(Ranch of the Sun)—in Valley Center, California.Her astonishing reputation brought her not only teaching jobs at the Women’s College in Beijing, China, but also an invitation to serve on a team of scientists and nutritionists as an invited member to NASA’s mission to Mars. The team will develop dietary recommendations for the astronauts in order to prevent osteoporosis and other health imbalances during space missions. A public figure, Shelley Redford Young has appeared on TV, been a keynote speaker at Tony Robbins’ Life Mastery events. Shelley is also a member of the InnerLight Foundation Association of Microcopists and has trained under the direction of Dr. Young in all aspects of The New Biology™.Shelley Young has been influenced greatly by John Robbins’ book Diet for a New America and is an advocate of healing through a properly balanced way of eating, living, and thinking. Always coming from the heart, she believes that healing should be available and affordable to all, especially children. Conscious of the effect of poor nutrition on children, she has become an activist in influencing schools to improve school lunch programs and to promote better health through an alkaline diet. Because she feels so strongly about educating the next generation, she has created two alkalarian heroes for children: Doc Broc and the AvoRado Kid. These characters are delighting children in the picture book called Doc Broc and the StoneHinge Cave Adventure, which Shelley has written and illustrated together with her son Adam Young. Along with her husband, Dr. Robert O. Young, Shelley Redford Young is Co-Founder of InnerLight, Inc., and The InnerLight Biological Research and Health and Education Foundation. This Foundation is committed to assisting people who are dealing with debilitating diseases. The Youngs established the foundation in order to provide valuable healing information and to share Dr. Young’s research with the world. Their extracurricular projects include a double-blind research study at the University of Miami on curing diabetes as well as applying their research to treat the wild animals at Out of Africa Wildlife Park in Arizona. Shelley Redford Young is the mother of four  children. An artist and illustrator, she has studied art at the Watt’s Atelier in Encinitas, California, where she focused on the human figure and illustration."Microbiologist and Wife, Featured Speakers at Morehouse College Event" On Thursday, March 31, 2005, Dr. Robert O. Young, Ph.D., D.Sc. and his wife, Shelley Redford Young, of Valley Center, California were featured speakers at the prestigious Morehouse College's “Science and Spiritual Awareness Week.” Morehouse is the nation’s largest, private liberal arts college for African-American men.The Young’s were invited by Dr. Lawrence Edward Carter, Sr., Dean of the Martin Luther King, Jr., International Chapel, to Atlanta, Georgia. The theme of the week-long conference was "The Diet of Life”.Dr. Young incorporated many spiritual principals into his talk titled "Feasting Upon the LIGHT." He spoke at a luncheon for the medical faculty, students, honorees, and other invited guests. Shelley Young presented The Alkalarian Nutritional Lifestyle at a subsequent seminar in the afternoon, teaching participants how to alkalize their diets—the practical application of her husband’s science.In addition to being presenters, Dr. Young was inducted into the Morehouse Colloquium of Scholars and Shelley Young was inducted to the Board of Sponsors. Both were placed on the Martin Luther King Chapel Advisory Board. During the induction, the Young’s presented a copy of the Freedman's Bank Records CD to Dr. Carter which contains valuable African-American family history records gathered and compiled by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  The Youngs have written several books including Sick and Tired, Back to the House of Health Cook Book I and II, The pH Miracle, The pH Miracle for Diabetes, The pH Miracle for Weight Loss, and others. Sought after as keynote speakers at medical and health gatherings around the world, the Young’s have also appeared as guests on many national radio and television shows.

 The pH Miracle Alkaline Diet: Our Alkalarian Approachto Optimal Health by Dr. Robert and Shelley Young         Testimonials          "The New Biology made sense. However, I declared, "I am not going to give up my coffee, red meat and beer!" I was in for a surprise! On March 2, 2003 I began to take control of my health. The amazing changes that occurred with my body and my health have changed my life and my attitude about health and nutrition. I began drinking 3 liters of Greens per day. After just 2 liters of the greens (on the first day), my body began to crave the greens. My body knew that the greens were good for me!... products, along with a new way of eating, have changed my life."-Pam Schulte-Wagner Homestead, Iowa"Searching for health the last 30 years has been like an archeological dig... finding a "this" or a "that", only to discover they were useless."In 10 weeks I have lost 40 pounds of my 142 lb. target amount. But of the highest importance is the fact I can feel health seeping back inside once again. I have at last found my jewel beyond all price."A great shock was to find my singing voice starting to come back after 31 years of missing in action, and then noticing the age spots on my hands were actually getting lighter!- Elaine Boylston   OUR BODIES WERE DESIGNED TO BE HEALTHY, slender and energetic. We were intended to have smooth, supple skin and a quick, alert mind.  Instead we are overweight, tired, and sluggish. WHY?An Alkaline Diet Based on The New Biology® Dr. Robert O. Young's New Biology®, most simply stated, is that the over-acidification of the body is the single underlying cause of all disease. In contrast, the old biology, based on the work of Louis Pasteur in the late 1800s, stems from the idea that disease comes from germs which invade the body from the outside. Dr. Young has found that when the body is in healthy alkaline balance, germs are unable to get a foothold. Think of Your Body as a Fish Tank.Think of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the internal fluids of the body that we "swim" in daily. Imagine the fish in this tank are your cells and organ systems bathed in fluids, which transport food and remove wastes. Now imagine we back up a car and put the tailpipe up against the air intake filter that supplies the oxygen for the water in the tank instead of a quality water machine. The water becomes filled with carbon monoxide, lowering the alkaline pH, creating an acidic pH environment, and threatening the health of the "fish," your cells and organs. What if we throw in too much food or the wrong kind of food (acid-producing food like dairy, sugar, and animal protein) and the fish are unable to consume or digest it all, and it starts to decompose and putrefy? Toxic acid waste and chemicals build up as the food breaks down, creating more acidic byproducts, altering the optimum alkaline pH of the water. Basically, this is a small example of what we may be doing to our internal fluids every day. We are fouling them with pollution, smoking, drugs, excessive intake of food, over-consumption of acid-forming foods, and any number of transgressions which compromise the delicate balance of our internal alkaline fluids. Some of us have fish tanks (bodies) that are barely able to support life, yet we somehow manage to struggle from day to day, building more sever imbalances until there is the inevitable crash and debilitating chronic, disturbing and disorganizing symptoms to deal with.The pH level (the acid-alkaline measurement) of our internal fluids affects every cell in our bodies. Extended acid imbalances of any kind are not well tolerated by the body. Indeed, the entire metabolic process depends on a balanced internal alkaline environment. A chronically over-acidic pH corrodes body tissue, slowly eating into the 60,000 miles of veins and arteries like acid eating into marble. If left unchecked, it will interrupt all cellular activities and functions, from the beating of your heart to the neural firing of your brain. In summary, over-acidification interferes with life itself leading to all sickness and disease!  How Do You Know If You're Overly Acidic?Fat is an Acid Problem so Drink Your Greens!Perhaps one of Dr. Young's most well known discoveries is his theory of the cause of obesity—the overweight. He has shown that fat is actually an over-acidification problem. What does that mean? The body creates fat cells to carry acids away from your vital organs, so these acids literally don't choke your organs to death. Fat is saving your life! Fat is actually a response from the body to an alarming over-acidic condition. So how do you lose weight? Alkalize and Exercise, beginning with the health and diet plan outlined in The pH Miracle, by enjoying an organic greens drink product that is loaded with chlorophyll, like Doc Broc Power Plants, and by drinking purified, alkaline water from one of the quality water ionizers we offer, such as the Chanson Miracle Water Ionizer.Alkaline Diet—Water and Food—to Maintain a Healthy WeightAt the other end of the health spectrum, the yeast and fungus produced within an overly acidic body can feed on your nutrients and reduce the chemical and mechanical absorption of everything you eat by as much as 50%. This causes many people to become excessively thin, which is no healthier than becoming overweight.  Without protein, your body cannot rebuild new tissues or produce enzymes, hormones, or hundreds of other chemical components necessary for cell energy and organ activity. Fatigue, illness, and body weight changes are the results. When an underweight person begins to follow the alkaline health and diet lifestyle they may initially loose a little more weight as their body chemistry stabilizes; but, as their body normalizes, they will begin to gain towards their ideal weight. Healthy bodies are not overweight or underweight. A healthy body naturally maintains its own ideal weight. You can begin to restore health, balance, and harmony to your body with pH Miracle brand nutritional supplements. As alkalizing and oxygenation begins to take place, the body naturally begins to seek its own ideal weight. Allergies Signify Over-AcidificationThe toxins produced within an overly acidic, oxygen deprived body may contribute significantly to what are often called the symptoms of allergy. In addition, the absorption of undigested proteins is a major cause of allergy conditions. The digestive system is weakened, which prevents the total breakdown of amino acids—often causing food allergies. This alone may produce a wide spectrum of severe allergic reactions. When you alkalize and exercise, beginning with an organic green drinks loaded with chlorophyll and purified, ionized water from a quality water machine/water ionizer, these allergies will begin to subside. This is because these products introduce oxygenating and alkalizing elements into your body—helping to balance the conditions that may lead to hyper-sensitivities.The Fatigue Due to an Acidic DietFatigue is probably the major symptom suffered by an overly acidic body. The toxins produced in an acidic body environment reduce the absorption of protein and minerals, which in turn weakens the body's ability to produce enzymes and hormones. This also interferes with the reconstruction of cells and other necessary components of energy production. The result is fatigue, poor endurance, an inability to add muscle tone, and general weakness. To abolish your fatigue and become the energetic person you want to be, begin by alkalizing with greens drinks like Doc Broc Power Plants and alkaline water from one of the excellent Chanson water ionizers we’ve made available.Doc Broc Power Plants, greens drink powder, is formulated to bring you vital nutrient elements and easily digested protein. This alkalizing, energizing, and nourishing green formula begins oxygenating your body. Alkaline Water and Water IonizersThe most important thing you must learn is to hydrate the body with alkalizing water. Like the earth on which we live, our bodies are 70% water. Food cravings are often the body's cry for water. A thirst for water will begin as one begins to hydrate with water.  A diet high in acid foods such as meat, dairy, grains, high sugar fruits, and bread causes acid wastes to build up in the body. When acid wastes enter our blood stream, the blood system will attempt to dispose of these wastes in liquid form through the lungs or the kidneys. If there are too many wastes to handle, they are deposited in various organ systems like the heart, pancreas, liver, colon, and other locations. The breakdown of this disposal process of acid waste could also be called "the aging process." To slow down and reverse this process, one must begin by removing this over-acidification of the blood and tissues by including liberal amounts of alkaline water in the diet. Alkaline water has a pH between 9 and 11, and will neutralize harmful stored acid wastes and gently remove them from the tissues.  And the best alkaline water comes from water ionizers, that produce many more positive effects than just alkalizing the water.  You can Learn more about Water Ionizers Here. Alkaline Diet—Foods You May Enjoy FreelyAre You Getting Enough Alkaline Foods in Your Diet? Your health depends on an alkaline environment, created by eating foods such as tomatoes, avocados and green vegetables...striking the optimum 80/20 balance and regulating your body's acid/alkaline chemistry through simple changes in diet can result in weight loss, increased stamina and strength, a stronger immune system and a greater sense of wellbeing.How Did We Become So Out of Balance?After years of societal changes, millions of dollars of marketing spent and technological advances, we, as a race, are now facing more dietary based health challenges than ever before. It is no coincidence that the rapidly growing numbers of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes correlate almost exactly with the rise in consumption of acid forming foods such as sugars, saturated fats, and white breads. At the same time our consumption of fresh vegetables and essential fatty acids has decreased dramatically, making way for convenience and a generation hooked on sugary treats. Becoming Alkaline With a Simple and Healthy DietThis is not as difficult or as technical as it sounds. When we talk about eating alkaline foods or starting an alkaline diet we are referring to consuming those foods and drink which have an alkaline effect on the body. This effect is based upon the ash residue that remains after our foods are consumed. Some foods leave an acid ash, whereas others leave an alkaline ash. Conveniently for us, our bodies have been designed to categorize which foods leave which kind of ash into neat and easy to remember groups.Of course, everybody is different - but most of us should aim to eat 75-80% alkaline foods and a maximum of 20-25% acid forming foods.The following guides and articles are intended to give you all of the information you need to successfully begin and maintain an alkaline lifestyle.

Dr. Robert H. Young - Biography












The official site of the legendary 
      composer

Dr. Robert H. 
      Young

1923 - 2011
 

Endorsed and approved by his 
      widow, Betty Young, and published as a tribute by 

Awesomewebs.net 
as our thanks to  Bob for his wonderful music, and to Betty, for sharing 
      him with us.




      










 

Biography
 

Robert H. Young was born in Santa Cruz, 
      California, on April 20, 1923.  After serving in the U. S. Marine 
      Corps from 1941 to 1945 (including Pearl Harbor, shortly after the 
      attack), he earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Otterbein College, 
      Master of Music from Northwestern University, and a Doctor of Musical Arts 
      from the University of Southern California.
 

His dissertation at USC was entitled 
      "The History of Baptist Hymnody in England from 1612 to 1800."  In 
      1997, he was named Distinguished Music Alumnus at Otterbein College.  
      He served as minister of music at churches in Huntington Park, Oakland, 
      and Los Angeles, California, and was on the faculties of San Francisco 
      Baptist College and the Worship and Arts Conference in Green Lake, 
      Wisconsin.
 

Dr. Young joined the faculty of Baylor 
      University in 1962 where he remained until retirement in 1993. Through his 
      thirty-year tenure, he was intern Chairman of Church Music, Chairman of 
      Vocal Studies, Chairman of Graduate Studies, and director of the Baylor 
      Chamber Singers, a 16-voice ensemble he founded in 1962 and that attained 
      a national reputation for excellence under his guidance.  The Baylor 
      Chamber Singers have been heard in churches and schools throughout the 
      United States.  It was his work with the Baylor Chamber Singers and 
      the beautiful performance venue of the Armstrong Browning Library that 
      provided much of the inspiration for his numerous choral compositions.
 

Dr. Young retired after twenty-seven 
      years as Choirmaster at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Waco.  He was 
      Conductor Emeritus of the Baylor Chamber Singers.  Active in TMEA, 
      ACDA and TCDA, he held the office of Vice President of the 
      Church/Community Division of TCDA from 1994-1996.  As an 
      award-winning member of ASCAP, Dr. Young had more than 100 choral 
      compositions published by some of the most prestigious publishing 
      companies in the United States, including Gentry Publications, Alliance 
      Music Publications, Carl Fischer, Colla Voce Publications, and National 
      Music Publishers.
 

Dr. Robert H. Young passed away on July 
      29, 2011 at the age of 88.  His ashes are interred in a garden of 
      honor at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Waco, Texas.

Medal of Honor citation[edit]
Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company E, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division
Place and date: North of Kaesong, Korea, October 9, 1950
Entered service at: Vallejo, Calif. Born: March 4, 1929, Oroville, California
G.O. No.: 65, August 2, 1951
Citation:

Pfc. Young distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. His company, spearheading a battalion drive deep in enemy territory, suddenly came under a devastating barrage of enemy mortar and automatic weapons crossfire which inflicted heavy casualties among his comrades and wounded him in the face and shoulder. Refusing to be evacuated, Pfc. Young remained in position and continued to fire at the enemy until wounded a second time. As he awaited first aid near the company command post the enemy attempted an enveloping movement. Disregarding medical treatment he took an exposed position and firing with deadly accuracy killed 5 of the enemy. During this action he was again hit by hostile fire which knocked him to the ground and destroyed his helmet. Later when supporting tanks moved forward, Pfc. Young, his wounds still unattended, directed tank fire which destroyed 3 enemy gun positions and enabled the company to advance. Wounded again by an enemy mortar burst, and while aiding several of his injured comrades, he demanded that all others be evacuated first. Throughout the course of this action the leadership and combative instinct displayed by Pfc. Young exerted a profound influence on the conduct of the company. His aggressive example affected the whole course of the action and was responsible for its success. Pfc. Young's dauntless courage and intrepidity reflect the highest credit upon himself and uphold the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army.[2]
