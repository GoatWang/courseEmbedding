Cesar Johnston Joins Energous Corporation as Senior Vice President of Engineering


 Download as PDF

July 09, 2014

PLEASANTON, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 07/09/14 -- 
 Energous Corporation ("Energous" or "the Company") (NASDAQ: WATT), the developer of WattUp™, a disruptive wire-free charging technology for electronic devices that provides power at a distance with complete mobility under full software control, today announced the appointment of Cesar Johnston as the Company's Senior Vice President of Engineering. Johnston will be responsible for leading Energous' team of engineers and working with key partners on developing WattUp. 
"Energous is delivering a revolutionary wire-free charging technology that will truly transform the consumer electronics market and the way consumers power their devices," said Johnston. "I am thrilled to be working with Energous and our customers to bring WattUp wire-free charging to market."
Previously, Johnston was the Vice President of Engineering at Marvell, a leading semiconductor company, where he focused on developing wireless connectivity solutions. Before holding this position, he served as the Senior Director of Engineering for Wi-Fi products at Broadcom and as the Senior Director of Systems Engineering at ARC. 
"Cesar's strong qualifications in mobile connectivity were a natural fit for Energous," said Stephen R. Rizzone, CEO of Energous Corporation. "I am excited to have Cesar join our highly experienced management team as we continue to focus on executing our strategic plan to finally deliver on the promise of a true wire-free charging solution."
About Energous Corporation
Energous Corporation is developing WattUp™, a wire-free charging technology that will transform the way people charge and power their electronic devices at home, in the office, in the car and beyond. WattUp is a revolutionary, patent- and trademark-pending solution that delivers intelligent, scalable power via the same radio bands as a Wi-Fi router. WattUp differs from current wireless charging systems in that it delivers meaningful, useable power, at a distance, while allowing users to roam while charging. The result is a wire-free experience that saves users from having to remember to plug in their devices or place them on a mat. Energous will initially license WattUp to the wearable and mobile-accessory markets and will expand to other markets such as Wi-Fi routers and smartphones over time.
