In a 50/50 joint-venture, the company and its partner invested a total of $72 million of equity, of which $58 million was funded from the December 2016 sale of The Grove, a 331-unit apartment community built in 1964 in San Jose, California. The partnership also secured a 10-year fixed-rate loan of $70 million at a rate of 4.06%, interest-only for the first five years.
“Radius is an exciting addition to our Seattle apartment portfolio,” said Shem Streeter, Managing Director of Kennedy Wilson Multifamily Investments. “Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood features some of the best rental demographics in the country, including a thriving job market and close proximity to many high growth companies. Our significant presence in the Seattle market allows us to leverage our existing operational expertise all while upgrading the overall quality of our portfolio through these two transactions.”
Radius is a class-A apartment community located in Seattle, WA. The property was built in 2015 and consists of 282 apartments offering tenants a modern, amenity-rich lifestyle. Radius’ amenity package includes two rooftop decks, gaming room, fitness center, and a private resident media room. Radius is located directly across the street from the world headquarters and main campus of Amazon and walking distance to over 10 million square feet of additional Amazon office space. The property is also walking distance to employers such as Facebook, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and a future 607,000 sq. ft. Google campus. Radius is next to many shops and restaurants, and is conveniently located near major freeways, providing quick access to the I-5, SR-99 and downtown Seattle.
The company now has an ownership interest in 10,430 units across 41 communities in the State of Washington.

In Landmark Deal, Capri Capital Partners and Kennedy Wilson Acquire Marina del Rey Apartment Property for $225 MillionLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Capri Capital Partners, LLC ("Capri"), on behalf of an institutional investor, and Kennedy Wilson  (NYS: KW)  have acquired 100% of the leasehold interest in Esprit, a luxury, multifamily mixed-use project with 437 units and a top-class 227-slip anchorage facility in Marina del Rey. The acquisition represents one of the largest multifamily mixed-use transactions in Los Angeles over the past several years.The Esprit Apartments, Marina del Rey, California (Photo: Business Wire)The five-building apartment complex is a premier multifamily rental property in the area. In addition to its exceptional waterfront location, the project includes a unique combination of resort-style amenities, spacious and luxurious units, and distinct finishes. The mix of studios, one, two, three and four bedroom units all feature water views, in-unit washer and dryers, 9-foot vaulted ceilings and private patios. The units are mostly split-level townhouse layouts with expansive walk-in closets and stainless steel kitchen appliances. A pedestrian promenade runs alongside the waterfront directly in front of the apartment complex.Additionally, Esprit offers one of the finest anchorage facilities in the area that attracts the area's most luxurious and expensive yachts and boats. This top-class boat slip offers mariners full utility packages, separate storage and water activity centers for guest use. The 227 boat slips range from 35 to 75 feet.Beginning immediately, Capri and Kennedy Wilson will move forward with a series of upgrades to further enhance the marketability of the asset. The team will invest approximately $5.3 million of additional capital to reconfigure the new leasing center, improve resident facilities, enhance landscaping and upgrade unit interiors."Capri's investment strategy is to actively acquire high-quality Class-A properties in high barrier markets with supply-demand imbalances and strong economic, demographic and income trends," said Ken Lombard, Partner of Investments for Capri. "Esprit is truly an iconic asset that meets our investment strategy and will be highly complementary to our investor's real estate portfolio. We are excited to be teaming up again with Kennedy Wilson to acquire this unique waterfront property and to be investing in one of the most coveted residential communities within Los Angeles County.""Esprit is considered the finest multifamily mixed-use property in Marina del Rey, and an off-market transaction to acquire a property of this size and quality is very rare," said Kurt Zech, President of Kennedy Wilson Multifamily Management Group. "The property was stabilized at 94% occupancy in late 2012 after a lengthy three year lease-up period and still has plenty of upside for rental growth in a steadily improving economy."The 18-acre property is ideally located in Los Angeles' Westside, within close proximity to the LA International Airport, the 90 and 405 freeways and employment hubs in nearby Santa Monica, as well as UCLA and Loyola Marymount University.Brian Eisendrath and Troy Tegeler of CBRE facilitated financing for the transaction with Fannie Mae.About Capri Capital PartnersCapri Capital Partners, LLC is an institutional real estate investment advisory firm, investing and managing commercial real estate properties and portfolios since 1992.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
