Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Defensive Style Funds, Momentum Style Funds, Multi-Style Funds, International Equity Fund, Global Equity Fund and Relaxed Constraint Equity Funds: January 28, 2018

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels.

60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies  and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Commentary

 As of June 30, 2017 

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Small Cap Core Fund (I Class Shares) underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Shares of RetailMeNot Inc. (0.0% portfolio weighting) increased during the period after the company was acquired by Harland Clarke Holdings Corp. in a deal valued at $630 million. Harland will pay $11.60 per share in cash, approximately 50% higher than the stock's closing price on the date of the transaction.

		Extreme Networks, Inc. (1.0% portfolio weighting) shares spiked during the period after management unveiled a fiscal year 2018 model at the company's analyst day, which incorporated the acquisitions of Avaya and Brocade into its financial projections. The model increased investor confidence by highlighting future revenues north of $1 billion and projected that the company will be the third-largest enterprise networking vendor, behind only Cisco and HP Enterprise.

		Shares of ArcBest Corp. (0.6% portfolio weighting) plummeted after the company released first-quarter earnings results below analyst estimates, which were already low due to seasonal headwinds. Poor earnings results were a function of weakness in the company's asset light business due to cyclically weak demand for truckloads, along with headwinds from the company's e-commerce platform for its asset heavy business.

		Our position in Insperity, Inc. (0.6% portfolio weighting) underperformed during the period after the company reported mixed first-quarter results hurt by lower-than-expected growth in net hiring and higher costs due to a spike in large health benefit claims, which are typically episodic. On a positive note, the company exhibited a solid improvement in client retention and strong operating expense management during the period.


	Looking ahead


		We continue to believe that our valuation factor is the key driver of long-term performance over a full market cycle. That said, we currently hold the view that stocks perceived to be more volatile are undervalued relative to historical averages. Therefore, we would expect the Fund to outperform in a market environment that is supportive of our pro-cyclical tilt.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.25% for A Shares, 1.75% for C Shares, 1.00% for I Shares, 0.80% for R5 Shares and 0.75% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 12/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2018 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the mutual fund includes performance of a predecessor account. Prior to the mutual fund's commencement of operations, the accounts were adjusted to reflect the expenses associated with the mutual fund. The accounts were not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, were not subject to the investment restrictions imposed by law on registered mutual funds. If the accounts had been registered, the performance may have been adversely affected. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell 2000 Index is an unmanaged index, measuring performance of the 2000 smallest stocks (on the basis of capitalization) in the Russell 3000 Index. The performance of the Lipper Small-Cap Core Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Small-capitalization investments typically carry more risk than investments in well-established "blue-chip" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
