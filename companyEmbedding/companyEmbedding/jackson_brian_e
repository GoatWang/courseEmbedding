Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Arizona:













Does Brian E Jackson Development Co carry a valid contracting license?



Although the State of Arizona allows its residents to hire unlicensed contractors, it strongly encourages them to hire licensed contractors for remodeling or construction work.
Brian E Jackson Development Co currently holds license 077294 (General Small Commercial Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Arizona?



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors maintains high standards for licensing. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience (this varies a bit based on specialty).











Your liability risk when hiring Brian E Jackson Development Co



Licensed contractors in Arizona with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Brian E Jackson Development Co



Residential contractors are required to provide a consumer protection bond. This may be in the form of a Surety Bond; cash deposit in the amount of $200,000; or payment into the Residential Contractors' Recovery Fund. Under certain conditions, consumers may be eligible to apply to the residential contractors' recovery fund and receive up to thirty thousand dollars to have the work corrected or completed.
Brian E Jackson Development Co has a $5,000 bond with American Contractors Indemnity Company.











What else should I know before hiring Brian E Jackson Development Co



Starting in '02, the ROC began performing a criminal background check on license applicants by checking their fingerprints against the FBI criminal database. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Description



This lab manual, created to accompany Introduction to Electric Circuits: Lab Manual, Ninth Edition (9780195438130), is suitable for introductory electric circuits courses offered through electrical technologist- and electrical technician-level programs. The manual contains a collection of experiments chosen to cover the main topics taught in foundational courses in electrical theory. Experiments can all be done with inexpensive test equipment and circuit components. Each lab concludes with questions to test students' comprehension of the theoretical concepts illustrated by the experimental results. The manual is formatted to enable it to double as a workbook, which allows students to answer questions directly in the lab manual.DISTINCTIVE FEATURESIncreased Coverage of AC and DC Motors and Filters. The lab manual has been revised to illustrate the updated material in Introduction to Electric Circuits, Ninth Edition, including thirteen DC and fifteen AC experiments and a new lab on passive filters.Designed for Students. Designed with students in mind, the text is spiral-bound for ease of use. It has been formatted in a way that allows students to use it as a workbook--including space to record experimental results and grids for graphing when necessary. Accessible. Each lab contains clear objectives, a brief summary of the necessary concepts to understand the experiment being conducted, illustrated instructions for use of equipment (such as ammeters), detailed procedural instructions with tips to ensure that students complete labs smoothly and effectively, and questions that allow students to check their understanding of the key concepts being illustrated by each lab.Instructor-Friendly. The manual includes a summary of all equipment and components required to run every lab in the book, allowing instructors to prepare their courses ahead of time.

Author Information

Herbert W. Jackson published the first edition of Introduction to Electric Circuits in 1959. Known as "the father of the Ontario college system", Jackson taught electronics and electrical engineering technology for more than forty years. In addition to authoring Introduction to Electric Circuits--a text that would become the industry standard and shape curricula for years to follow--Jackson was a member of the Ontario Ministry of Education, where he oversaw the creation of the province's community colleges.Dale Temple teaches electronics engineering technology at the College of the North Atlantic, where he has served as coordinator of the electronics program. Prior to working on Introduction to Electric Circuits, Temple contributed as a coauthor to the Canadian editions of Boylestad and Nashelsky's Electronic Devices and Theory and Tocci's Digital Systems: Principles and Applications.Brian Kelly is formerly an instructor at the College of the North Atlantic, where, in addition to teaching, he served as coordinator for the introductory circuit analysis course.
