                We operate three business groups — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands — which we believe are poised for long-term growth.
            









Calvin Klein
            
With global retail sales of approximately $8.4 billion in 2016, CALVIN KLEIN is one of the best known designer names in the world, offering provocative, modern designs. Our products are distributed through our wholesale partners and through over 2,800 retail locations (including company-operated, licensee and franchisee stores) across the world. Within the CALVIN KLEIN brand portfolio, CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC acts as a halo for the brand and offers inspiration to the other brands, which include CK CALVIN KLEIN (our contemporary line), CALVIN KLEIN (our master label), Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Jeans. CALVIN KLEIN products are available through our wholesale customers (third party retailers, distributors and pure play digital commerce retailers that sell our products in brick and mortar stores and on digital commerce sites), at our own company-operated retail locations across the world, and online through our own digital commerce sites in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, China, Hong Kong and Macau. Additionally, in certain markets, our products are distributed through licensees (including joint ventures), franchisees and distributors.

Business Structure and OverviewOur Calvin Klein business consists of two reportable segments: Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International.Calvin Klein North AmericaOur North American operations, which include revenues generated in the U.S., Canada and Mexico(1), accounted for approximately 55% of our Calvin Klein reported revenues in 2015. Product categories that are distributed in North America include men's sportswear and dress furnishings, men's and women's jeanswear, underwear, outerwear, fragrance, accessories, footwear, performance apparel, women's sportswear, dresses, intimates, suits and handbags and items for the home. Products are sold by us and our licensing partners, through wholesale customers (in stores and online), through our own network of retail stores, which are primarily located in premium outlet centers, and through our own digital commerce operations.



        Wholesale
    

            The wholesale channel is an important component of our business mix and one of the key ways we communicate our brand messaging and positioning to consumers. Accordingly, we partner with our wholesale customers to ensure that shop-in-shops, fixturing, marketing and customer service levels meet our standards given our premium brand positioning. Our wholesale customer base includes retailers such as Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Dillard's and Hudson's Bay (Canada), through which our products are available in stores and online.
    



        Retail
    

            Retail accounted for approximately 45% of Calvin Klein's North America sales in 2015(2). Our retail operations include approximately 200 stores, primarily located in premium outlet centers, as well as our U.S. digital commerce site, calvinklein.com, and our retail flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York City. Our outlet stores mainly offer men's and women's apparel and accessories made specifically for the channel, which is designed by our team in New York. 
    


Calvin Klein InternationalOur international operations accounted for approximately 45% of our 2015 reported Calvin Klein revenues (including revenues generated in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America). Internationally, our products are sold through the wholesale channel (in stores and online); our own network of retail locations (including concessions) under the brand names Calvin Klein Jeans, Calvin Klein Underwear, Calvin Klein Performance and CK CALVIN KLEIN; licensee stores under the brand names Calvin Klein Collection, Calvin Klein Platinum, Calvin Klein Performance and Calvin Klein Watch & Jewelry; and online through our digital commerce websites. Product assortments that are distributed internationally primarily include men's and women's jeanswear, underwear and accessories.



        Asia Pacific
    

Calvin Klein's Asia Pacific operations accounted for approximately 20% of Calvin Klein's reported revenues in 2015. Our regional headquarters is located in Hong Kong, and we have commercial teams based in Shanghai and Seoul and satellite offices in Tokyo, Taiwan and Singapore, to support our business in major markets such as China, South Korea and Southeast Asia. We also own an interest in joint ventures in India and Oceana (which encompasses Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific). In these countries, we sell CALVIN KLEIN jeanswear, underwear, performancewear, accessories and CALVIN KLEIN apparel (Australia and India only) primarily through the retail channel, which includes concessions, shop-in-shops, retail stores (both full price and outlet) and travel retail locations, which are located in major international airports. Our retail portfolio includes approximately 330 company-operated retail stores and approximately 350 concessions. Additionally, we operate a wholesale business, through which we primarily sell our products to distributors and franchisees (currently approximately 1,100 doors), and in certain markets, including Japan and South Korea, we have a significant department store presence. Digital commerce is a key focus area, with our products sold through Tmall, jd.com and our directly operated CALVIN KLEIN digital commerce sites in China, Hong Kong and Macau.




        Europe
    

Calvin Klein's European business accounted for approximately 20% of Calvin Klein's reported revenues in 2015. In these countries, we sell CALVIN KLEIN jeanswear, underwear and accessories, and a limited selection of men's CK CALVIN KLEIN apparel (primarily dress furnishings). Our store base includes approximately 150 retail stores (full price and outlet locations), approximately 480 concessions and approximately 115 franchisee stores. We also operate digital commerce sites across Europe, which have the capacity to ship to approximately 25 countries.We continue to see a notable opportunity to improve the profitability of Calvin Klein’s European operations, as we build upon our efforts that were initiated in 2015 and were met with initial success. The largest CALVIN KLEIN product offerings in the region include Calvin Klein Underwear, which is experiencing strong performance, and Calvin Klein Jeans, where we are making investments and capitalizing on the halo effect and strong consumer appetite that Calvin Klein Underwear has provided for the brand. During 2015, we improved our sales and profitability of Calvin Klein Jeans products by investing in the brand, upgrading the product with enhanced designs, denim washes and quality, enhancing our store and shop in shop presence and improving our distribution.




        Latin America
    

Calvin Klein's Latin America business, which consists primarily of our directly controlled operations in Brazil, accounted for approximately 4% of Calvin Klein's reported revenues in 2015. We primarily distribute CALVIN KLEIN products through the wholesale channel (in stores and online), a limited number of retail stores and our digital commerce site. Products sold include CALVIN KLEIN jeanswear, sportswear, accessories, underwear and related products. We also see a notable opportunity to expand the CALVIN KLEIN "better" apparel and accessories distribution in the region. Additionally, we have been expanding throughout South America through a third-party licensee.

        Largest Third-Party Licensees

Calvin Klein's two largest third-party licensees in terms of 2016 global retail sales are:G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (“G-III”), which generated approximately $1.7 billion in global retail sales in 2016 (primarily in North America) selling men's and women's coats and swimwear; luggage and women's suits, dresses, sportswear, active performancewear; handbags and small leather goods under the CALVIN KLEIN brand.Coty, Inc., our fragrance licensee, which generated approximately $1.2 billion in global retail sales in 2016. CALVIN KLEIN continues to be a top designer fragrance brand worldwide.

Business Structure and Overview
            
Our Tommy Hilfiger business consists of two reportable segments: Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International.Tommy Hilfiger North AmericaTommy Hilfiger North America(1) accounted for approximately 50% of Tommy Hilfiger's reported revenues in 2015. This includes revenues generated from the wholesale channel (in stores and online), through our own retail stores, our company-operated digital commerce site and licensing agreements.



        Retail
    

Retail accounts for approximately 70% of Tommy Hilfiger's North American sales(2). This consists principally of sales generated from approximately 240 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Our store base primarily consists of company stores, which are located in premium outlet centers and carry specially designed merchandise at a lower price point than our other stores, as well as several full-price flagship and anchor stores. Additionally, we generate sales from our digital commerce site, tommy.com, which acts as an effective brand marketing tool and an e-commerce platform.




        Wholesale
    

Our wholesale business represents approximately 30% of Tommy Hilfiger North America's sales(2). Macy's is the exclusive department store retailer for Tommy Hilfiger men's and women's sportswear in the U.S. and, in Canada, Hudson's Bay is the principal department store retailer. Both of these customers sell our goods in their stores and on their digital commerce sites. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with G-III for the design, production and distribution of Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the U.S. and Canada, beginning in Holiday 2016. This agreement includes PVH’s current women’s sportswear business (which will continue to be sold in the U.S. exclusively through Macy’s) and additional categories, including suit separates, performance and denim (which can be sold through a variety of wholesale accounts, including Macy’s).We view Macy's and Hudson's Bay as key partners in further shaping our North American sportswear strategy, and we are continually expanding the brand's presence in top doors at both department stores, maximizing sales of key items and upgrading the in-store experience by creating clear and impactful store presentations. Additionally, we license certain lifestyle product categories including eyewear, watches, dresses, fragrance and home furnishings, which are also sold at Macy's and Hudson's Bay, as well as through other retailers.



Tommy Hilfiger InternationalTommy Hilfiger International accounted for approximately 50% of the business' reported revenues in 2015. Products are sold by us through the wholesale and retail channels in Europe, Japan and China(3); through joint ventures in India, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand; and by third party distributors, licensees and franchisees in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. We also operate digital commerce sites in Europe, Brazil, Japan and China.



        Europe
    

Tommy Hilfiger has well-established operations in Europe that accounted for approximately 45% of Tommy Hilfiger's reported revenues in 2015. The largest markets in Europe are Germany and Spain.Across Europe, Tommy Hilfiger products are primarily sold through the wholesale channel, which represents approximately 60% of sales(2) – with customers ranging from large department stores to small independent stores. There are also over 600 retail stores (of which approximately 45% are company-operated, while the remainder are franchisee and distributor stores) and approximately 160 concession locations. Our company-operated store base in Europe consists of full price and outlet stores. Tommy Hilfiger's digital commerce operations are well-developed in Europe, as our directly operated European digital commerce sites are our largest and most profitable, and have the potential to ship to over 30 countries. Looking ahead, we see the largest potential to open additional retail locations in the Middle East and Africa (which is included within our European operations).




        Asia Pacific
    

Tommy Hilfiger’s operations in Asia Pacific include its Japan and China businesses, which are owned; its businesses in India, Australia and New Zealand, which are operated through joint ventures; and its business across Southeast Asia, which is licensed to a third party. The Asia Pacific businesses operated through joint ventures and licenses generated retail sales of approximately $355 million in 2016.In Japan, we operate approximately 150 stores. We are repositioning this business to align more closely with Tommy Hilfiger's premium position globally, by enhancing our distribution and product offerings. We are starting to see early positive signs from our investments and we look forward to seeing further improvement in the underlying business in the years ahead.In April 2016, we acquired the 55% interest in the Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China that we did not already own. We see this as a significant opportunity, as it allows us to directly operate in Tommy Hilfiger’s fastest growing market, while also leveraging our well-established infrastructure in Asia, regional leadership expertise and strong brand momentum across our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in the region. In particular, we see a large opportunity to grow our categories outside of men’s sportswear, including womenswear, kids’, tailored apparel and denim. We also believe that we drive growth through additional retail store openings and investing in brand marketing.




        Latin America
    

Our Latin America operations are showing continued momentum. Revenues in the region are primarily generated in Panama and Brazil. In Brazil, we have a joint venture with a local partner that was established in January 2013. Over the next several years, we plan to expand the brand’s presence significantly in the country, as we believe that Brazil is our largest underpenetrated market opportunity in the region. Tommy Hilfiger's store base includes approximately 210 full-price and outlet store locations in the region.

We market both dress shirts and neckwear under brands including Van Heusen, ARROW, IZOD, Eagle, Sean John, Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Kenneth Cole New York, MICHAEL Michael Kors and Michael Kors Collection. We also market dress shirts under the Chaps brand, among others. We market neckwear under the J. Garcia brand, plus an array of other licensed and private label brands, which comprise approximately 35% of our neckwear business revenues. These offerings are primarily sold to department, chain and specialty store customers (for sale in stores and online). To a lesser degree, our products are sold in higher-end department stores, such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue, and in mass market stores. Collectively, product offerings represent a sizeable portion of the domestic dress furnishings market; we had a greater than 50% market share in neckwear and an approximately 40% market share in dress shirts in 2015 unit volume in U.S. Department and Chain Stores combined. Recently, we have been focused on adding innovation and performance features to our products, including our successful launch of the Van Heusen Flex Collar shirt in Fall 2015. Based on positive performance, we are leveraging this feature to several of our other dress shirt offerings.




        Heritage Brands Sportswear
    

Our Heritage Brands Sportswear business also includes the design and marketing of sportswear, including men's knit and woven sport shirts, sweaters, bottoms and outerwear at wholesale, principally under the IZOD, Van Heusen and ARROW brands. Our products are primarily sold to department, chain, specialty, mass market, club and off-price store customers (for sale in stores and online), although we also operate approximately 170 Van Heusen retail stores, which are primarily located in outlet malls in the U.S. and Canada. While we continually look to close underperforming Van Heusen stores as leases come due, we plan to operate Van Heusen retail as a complement to the brand's wholesale operations and leverage its resources across the business, which we believe will help improve the brand's productivity. We have implemented strategic initiatives intended to improve performance, including multi-brand outlet stores that sell Van Heusen, IZOD Golf and Warner’s within one storefront, which has been well-received by consumers.




        Swimwear
    

We design, manufacture and sell men's, women's and children's swimwear, pool and deck footwear and swim related products and accessories such as swim goggles, learn-to-swim aids, water-based fitness products and training accessories under the Speedo brand. Products are distributed in North America and the Caribbean through all major distribution channels, including mass market stores, sporting goods stores, team dealers, swim clubs, off-price stores, catalog retailers and digital commerce sites, including Speedo's SpeedoUSA.com digital commerce site.




        Underwear / Core Intimates
    

Our underwear and core intimates offerings include intimate apparel, shapewear and loungewear under the Warner's and Olga brands, as well as underwear under the Michael Kors brand. Our objective is to leverage core competencies and best practices from across the PVH organization to enhance our products and assortments. This includes leveraging Calvin Klein Underwear's strong expertise in product, packaging and marketing, as well as capitalizing on Warner's reputation in bras and Olga's in fuller-figure sizing. Our underwear and intimates offerings are sold across a variety of retail channels, including department, chain, club, off-price and mass market stores (in stores and online).



 (1)On April 19, 2016, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture that will license the rights to operate and manage the distribution of Calvin Klein brand products, along with Tommy Hilfiger, Warner’s, Olga and Speedo, in Mexico. The transaction is expected to occur late in the third quarter of 2016. The Tommy Hilfiger Mexico business is currently operating under a licensing agreement with our partner, Grupo Axo.(2)Retail and Wholesale split excludes licensing revenues.(3)Our acquisition of the 55% interest in the Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China that we did not already own closed in April 2016, and, therefore, is not included in 2015 results.

PVH Corp.: Make American Fashion Great Again (A La Calvin Klein And Tommy Hilfiger) - PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PVH Corp.: Make American Fashion Great Again (A La Calvin Klein And Tommy Hilfiger)Jul.27.17 | About: PVH Corp. (PVH) Goddess Diogenes Long/short equity, research analyst, tech, biotechSummaryCalvin Klein is on the upswing with fashion powerhouse, Raf Simons, leading creative design in addition to the well-executed marketing campaigns targeting millennials and youth.Tommy Hilfiger is also becoming more relevant with an upcoming collaboration with Vetements, the Zurich-based streetwear brand known for its sold-out $1,000+ hoodies.As fashion people get excited about the PVH brands, this will drive the diffusion brands and aspirational items (fragrance, underwear, jeans).Can this momentum in Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger boost PVH as the Stan Smith sneaker did for adidas in 2014?Jeff Macke has been touting his PVH (NYSE:PVH) long, predicting that PVH will focus on more direct-to-consumer instead of selling at Macy's (NYSE:M). He believes that selling at Macy's, where clothes are on the floor, devalues a brand. His prediction is probably right in that direct-to-consumer will be likely a bigger slice of the pie for PVH. I also think there are other aspects of gaining momentum and tailwind that looks to be like a potential brand revival. So, what is PVH? PVH is one of the largest apparel company in the US, with over $8Bn in revenue, top-line growth around 3%. The market cap is ~$9Bn, and ~$12Bn enterprise value. It is the holding company that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein (75% of sales), in addition to Van Heusen, IZOD, Arrow, Bass, Speedo (the collective known as Heritage Brands). In the US, its largest distribution is through department stores like Macy's. 52% of its sales comes from the U.S., and Europe following at 30% of sales. Europe and Asia see double-digit top-line growth whereas US is mostly flatline. The stock has gapped up last three quarters of earnings and is trading at its 52-week highs. 


 Source: PVH presentation, note that PVH has some licensing business and the sum of the sales of the three lines do not equal PVH revenues "We look to assume more direct control over various licensed businesses where we have core competencies" The corporate strategy has been to control more of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger (core competencies) by buying back international JVs (Ireland, Russia, China), different lines of businesses (acquisition of Warnaco), and licensed retail stores (see increase in directly owned stores below). This strategy likely came from an MBB consultant and has been a few years and many deals in the making. 

 Source: PVH presentation The stock is near 52-week highs? Why buy the stock now? The NYTimes wrote a very endearing article about the new creative director, Raf Simons, being not only the savior for Calvin Klein but also savior of New York fashion. Raf has everyone in the fashion world excited, and I believe Raf is exactly what PVH needs at this point. Raf built his name being the creative director at Jil Sander. He was then poached by Dior, where Raf designed the dress that Jennifer Lawrence tripped on during the Oscars. Dior sales rose 60% under his tenure and were the stabilizing force of the brand after a string of scandals under Galliano. Most recently, as of August 2016, he has moved to New York to oversee complete creative direction over all Calvin Klein lines. The last person to have complete control was Calvin Klein himself. This is Raf's opportunity to reshape the identity of an iconic brand from its designs to its advertising, to its choice of celebrity models. In 2016, Raf won the CFDA Awards for both Menswear Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year. Incidentally, the only other designer to do the same was Calvin Klein himself in 1993.
 There are other positive strategic, product, and marketing decisions in addition to zeitgeist that acts as tailwind for Calvin Klein:  Calvin Klein was recently re-introduced at Barneys New York. The EVP and general merchandiser for womenswear raved about Raf, without even seeing the merchandise. Barneys buyers usually set the trends for other high-end department stores. The #mycalvins underwear campaign featuring Justin Bieber, Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Jenner, Ashton Sander (Moonlight), and Brooke Shields (yes, she is back) was wildly successful. Going through #mycalvins on Instagram will simultaneous make you feel old and realize that Calvin Klein underwear is cool again. The retro themed XX music video in collaboration with Raf Simons of Calvin Klein featuring Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven from Stranger Things). The video was essentially a Calvin Klein commercial with the hottest stars decked out in the latest collection. For better or for worse, 1980s/1990s style is back in fashion, including the Marky Mark Calvin Klein's banded underwear, oversized hoodies, chokers, and adidas Stan Smith sneakers. Calvin Klein just kicked off the Fall/Winter 2017 campaign, CALVIN KLEIN 205W29NYC entitled "American Classics", and it has been well received by the fashion community.  The social media game is strong at 9.7M followers on Instagram vs. 1.8M followers for Gap (NYSE:GPS), 2.1M followers for Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), 13M followers for Prada (OTCPK:PRDSF). Raf Simons has launched a collaboration with adidas (OTCQX:ADDDF) for a pair of $500 sneakers.  

Tommy Hilfiger is also a source of revival for the PVH franchise. Tommy Hilfiger is doing a collaboration with Vetements, the Zurich-based streetwear brand better known for its $1,000+ hoodies. This collection will be available in February 2018 and sold at Barneys New York, Harrods London, and Colette Paris. Global ambassadors to Tommy Hilfiger include cultural icons The Chainsmokers and Gigi Hadid.
 Ok, we get it. Fashion people think PVH is cool. What does that have to do with the fundamentals and the stock? 1. High street drives main street Some will argue that main street does not care/know about Raf Simons. However, I will argue that the biggest sellers (jeans, underwear, and fragrances) are diffusion lines, and the success of those brands are usually driven by high-fashion and marketing. High street usually trickles down into main street a few seasons behind. Below are the Google Trends analytics for "Calvin Klein" and "Tommy Hilfiger", respectively. Taking into account seasonality during holiday seasons, there has been a steady uptick in interest over time, especially the last few months. 

 

Source: Google 2. Guidance by the company is conservative if you believe that Calvin Klein will have a brand revival  “With the appointment of Raf Simons, Calvin Klein began a momentous new chapter in the brand’s history. As we continue to evolve, this new direction will further strengthen our premium positioning worldwide and pave the way for long-term global growth. - Steven B. Shiffman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Calvin Klein The above statement by Calvin Klein CEO is fairly bullish but doesn't seem reflected in the company guidance. PVH guidance does not account for a brand revival, but rather a conservative growth rate based on the current order book and organic growth at $8.4Bn (~3% growth) of revenue and $7.40-7.60 EPS for the fiscal year. Wall Street consensus is at $8.5Bn of revenue and $7.51 EPS.
 As with most consumer companies, the biggest driver of growth is the brand itself. The best example of a brand revival I can think of is adidas with the relaunch of the Stan Smith sneakers, and now Superstar sneakers. Below is a five-year stock price chart (plotted against earnings) and revenue chart for adidas. Can you guess when the Stan Smiths were re-launched? adidas re-launched the Stan Smith mid-2014, as seen in the revenue bar chart. A year after the revenue bump, adidas beat earnings for consecutive quarters. Wall Street tends to gets fashion wrong because it cannot predict a change in trends. 



Source: Sentieo 3. Europe is a powerhouse in the making In European cities like Amsterdam and Paris, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger (sadly also Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF)) are premium brands. It is probably because Europe doesn't have Macy's, and Europeans have never seen these clothing trampled on the floor at 80% off sale with an additional 15% off. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are sold in premium department stores such as Printemps and Galeries Lafayette in addition to over 1,700 retail stores. PVH enjoys higher margins in Europe as a premium brand as well as higher retail/wholesale mix (69% retail in Europe vs. 41% retail in the U.S.). Below are top regions on the Google search for "Calvin Klein" and "Tommy Hilfiger" (respectively). Europe tops on interests for the two brands.
 



Source: Google Who is Jeff Macke and why is he long? Jeff Macke is a master chartist and the "father figure America deserves." His father was the first CEO of Target and has grown up around consumer retail. Jeff is a great thinker and expert in all things retail. I think Jeff's long thesis is that PVH will go through margin expansion and increased sales as they focus on direct-to-consumer on their website instead of selling at Macy's. With the acquisition of True & Co, it does seem that PVH realizes that direct-to-consumer is the future of retail. What he is arguing for makes sense, but ultimately the turnaround of the image of a brand drives sales and profitability more than operational or business model improvements. So what should I do? I don't know what you should do, but I know what I would do. I really do believe that the stars are aligned for PVH will have some outstanding quarters to come due to a brand resurgence. Options are pretty expensive at the moment, so I'm looking to pick up stock. Beyond earnings, there is no short-term catalyst for a brand revival. I'd look to buy along the 20-day moving average as it seems to want to return back to the trend line. I'd look for a long-term play and just ride it until the momentum changes.  

What is the bear case on PVH? 
 As with anything else, please do your own due diligence. PVH is prone to miss earnings like any other company although its earnings are, in my opinion, conservative. PVH is subject to sell-offs as the broader retail sector has been very challenged. Relative valuations are reasonable given the growth rates, but the industry can see multiple contraction.

PVH Corp.: Make American Fashion Great Again (A La Calvin Klein And Tommy Hilfiger) - PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PVH Corp.: Make American Fashion Great Again (A La Calvin Klein And Tommy Hilfiger)Jul.27.17 | About: PVH Corp. (PVH) Goddess Diogenes Long/short equity, research analyst, tech, biotechSummaryCalvin Klein is on the upswing with fashion powerhouse, Raf Simons, leading creative design in addition to the well-executed marketing campaigns targeting millennials and youth.Tommy Hilfiger is also becoming more relevant with an upcoming collaboration with Vetements, the Zurich-based streetwear brand known for its sold-out $1,000+ hoodies.As fashion people get excited about the PVH brands, this will drive the diffusion brands and aspirational items (fragrance, underwear, jeans).Can this momentum in Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger boost PVH as the Stan Smith sneaker did for adidas in 2014?Jeff Macke has been touting his PVH (NYSE:PVH) long, predicting that PVH will focus on more direct-to-consumer instead of selling at Macy's (NYSE:M). He believes that selling at Macy's, where clothes are on the floor, devalues a brand. His prediction is probably right in that direct-to-consumer will be likely a bigger slice of the pie for PVH. I also think there are other aspects of gaining momentum and tailwind that looks to be like a potential brand revival. So, what is PVH? PVH is one of the largest apparel company in the US, with over $8Bn in revenue, top-line growth around 3%. The market cap is ~$9Bn, and ~$12Bn enterprise value. It is the holding company that owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein (75% of sales), in addition to Van Heusen, IZOD, Arrow, Bass, Speedo (the collective known as Heritage Brands). In the US, its largest distribution is through department stores like Macy's. 52% of its sales comes from the U.S., and Europe following at 30% of sales. Europe and Asia see double-digit top-line growth whereas US is mostly flatline. The stock has gapped up last three quarters of earnings and is trading at its 52-week highs. 


 Source: PVH presentation, note that PVH has some licensing business and the sum of the sales of the three lines do not equal PVH revenues "We look to assume more direct control over various licensed businesses where we have core competencies" The corporate strategy has been to control more of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger (core competencies) by buying back international JVs (Ireland, Russia, China), different lines of businesses (acquisition of Warnaco), and licensed retail stores (see increase in directly owned stores below). This strategy likely came from an MBB consultant and has been a few years and many deals in the making. 

 Source: PVH presentation The stock is near 52-week highs? Why buy the stock now? The NYTimes wrote a very endearing article about the new creative director, Raf Simons, being not only the savior for Calvin Klein but also savior of New York fashion. Raf has everyone in the fashion world excited, and I believe Raf is exactly what PVH needs at this point. Raf built his name being the creative director at Jil Sander. He was then poached by Dior, where Raf designed the dress that Jennifer Lawrence tripped on during the Oscars. Dior sales rose 60% under his tenure and were the stabilizing force of the brand after a string of scandals under Galliano. Most recently, as of August 2016, he has moved to New York to oversee complete creative direction over all Calvin Klein lines. The last person to have complete control was Calvin Klein himself. This is Raf's opportunity to reshape the identity of an iconic brand from its designs to its advertising, to its choice of celebrity models. In 2016, Raf won the CFDA Awards for both Menswear Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year. Incidentally, the only other designer to do the same was Calvin Klein himself in 1993.
 There are other positive strategic, product, and marketing decisions in addition to zeitgeist that acts as tailwind for Calvin Klein:  Calvin Klein was recently re-introduced at Barneys New York. The EVP and general merchandiser for womenswear raved about Raf, without even seeing the merchandise. Barneys buyers usually set the trends for other high-end department stores. The #mycalvins underwear campaign featuring Justin Bieber, Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Jenner, Ashton Sander (Moonlight), and Brooke Shields (yes, she is back) was wildly successful. Going through #mycalvins on Instagram will simultaneous make you feel old and realize that Calvin Klein underwear is cool again. The retro themed XX music video in collaboration with Raf Simons of Calvin Klein featuring Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven from Stranger Things). The video was essentially a Calvin Klein commercial with the hottest stars decked out in the latest collection. For better or for worse, 1980s/1990s style is back in fashion, including the Marky Mark Calvin Klein's banded underwear, oversized hoodies, chokers, and adidas Stan Smith sneakers. Calvin Klein just kicked off the Fall/Winter 2017 campaign, CALVIN KLEIN 205W29NYC entitled "American Classics", and it has been well received by the fashion community.  The social media game is strong at 9.7M followers on Instagram vs. 1.8M followers for Gap (NYSE:GPS), 2.1M followers for Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), 13M followers for Prada (OTCPK:PRDSF). Raf Simons has launched a collaboration with adidas (OTCQX:ADDDF) for a pair of $500 sneakers.  

Tommy Hilfiger is also a source of revival for the PVH franchise. Tommy Hilfiger is doing a collaboration with Vetements, the Zurich-based streetwear brand better known for its $1,000+ hoodies. This collection will be available in February 2018 and sold at Barneys New York, Harrods London, and Colette Paris. Global ambassadors to Tommy Hilfiger include cultural icons The Chainsmokers and Gigi Hadid.
 Ok, we get it. Fashion people think PVH is cool. What does that have to do with the fundamentals and the stock? 1. High street drives main street Some will argue that main street does not care/know about Raf Simons. However, I will argue that the biggest sellers (jeans, underwear, and fragrances) are diffusion lines, and the success of those brands are usually driven by high-fashion and marketing. High street usually trickles down into main street a few seasons behind. Below are the Google Trends analytics for "Calvin Klein" and "Tommy Hilfiger", respectively. Taking into account seasonality during holiday seasons, there has been a steady uptick in interest over time, especially the last few months. 

 

Source: Google 2. Guidance by the company is conservative if you believe that Calvin Klein will have a brand revival  “With the appointment of Raf Simons, Calvin Klein began a momentous new chapter in the brand’s history. As we continue to evolve, this new direction will further strengthen our premium positioning worldwide and pave the way for long-term global growth. - Steven B. Shiffman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Calvin Klein The above statement by Calvin Klein CEO is fairly bullish but doesn't seem reflected in the company guidance. PVH guidance does not account for a brand revival, but rather a conservative growth rate based on the current order book and organic growth at $8.4Bn (~3% growth) of revenue and $7.40-7.60 EPS for the fiscal year. Wall Street consensus is at $8.5Bn of revenue and $7.51 EPS.
 As with most consumer companies, the biggest driver of growth is the brand itself. The best example of a brand revival I can think of is adidas with the relaunch of the Stan Smith sneakers, and now Superstar sneakers. Below is a five-year stock price chart (plotted against earnings) and revenue chart for adidas. Can you guess when the Stan Smiths were re-launched? adidas re-launched the Stan Smith mid-2014, as seen in the revenue bar chart. A year after the revenue bump, adidas beat earnings for consecutive quarters. Wall Street tends to gets fashion wrong because it cannot predict a change in trends. 



Source: Sentieo 3. Europe is a powerhouse in the making In European cities like Amsterdam and Paris, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger (sadly also Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF)) are premium brands. It is probably because Europe doesn't have Macy's, and Europeans have never seen these clothing trampled on the floor at 80% off sale with an additional 15% off. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are sold in premium department stores such as Printemps and Galeries Lafayette in addition to over 1,700 retail stores. PVH enjoys higher margins in Europe as a premium brand as well as higher retail/wholesale mix (69% retail in Europe vs. 41% retail in the U.S.). Below are top regions on the Google search for "Calvin Klein" and "Tommy Hilfiger" (respectively). Europe tops on interests for the two brands.
 



Source: Google Who is Jeff Macke and why is he long? Jeff Macke is a master chartist and the "father figure America deserves." His father was the first CEO of Target and has grown up around consumer retail. Jeff is a great thinker and expert in all things retail. I think Jeff's long thesis is that PVH will go through margin expansion and increased sales as they focus on direct-to-consumer on their website instead of selling at Macy's. With the acquisition of True & Co, it does seem that PVH realizes that direct-to-consumer is the future of retail.

About Pvh Corp.


   PVH has the buttoned-up look covered. A top global apparel player, it is the world's largest dress shirt and neckwear company. PVH owns and globally markets lifestyle brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Its closet also overflows with clothing, accessories, and footwear for men, women, and children. PVH owns Heritage Brands, which include Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner's, Olga, Eagle, and Bass.  Private-label and licensed brands, such as DKNY, Speedo, Kenneth Cole New York, and MICHAEL Michael Kors, round out its wardrobe. PVH generates sales from multiple channels: about 1,450 company-operated retail stores, retailers, licensees, franchisees, distributors who resell, and royalty and advertising fees.
  
Operations

   PVH organizes its business into three main areas. Tommy Hilfiger consists of North America and International businesses and is the largest segment, contributing 44% of company revenues in 2016. Calvin Klein (36% of revenue), consists of the Calvin Klein Licensing and Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segments and comprises Calvin Klein dress furnishings, sportswear, and outlet retail divisions in North America. Finally, Heritage Brands (22% of revenue) consists of the Heritage Brand Dress Furnishings (men's dress shirts and neckwear), Wholesale Sportswear, and Retail segments.
  

   The company's products are made in more 1,450 factories in more than 50 countries worldwide.
  

   In addition to the more than 1,900 retail stores that it operates, PVH maintains wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers in the US, Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands. The centers inspect, sort, pack, and ship goods to customers.
  
Geographic Reach

   The company sells products in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico, and Brazil. Its US business accounted for 55% of sales in fiscal 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   PVH's Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Heritage Brands businesses all distribute products through multiple channels, including retail, wholesale, and licensing to third parties. Within the retail channel, each business has its own network of company-operated stores (those in the US and Canada tend to be located in outlet malls), specialty stores, and company-operated e-commerce sites. On the wholesale side, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger products are sold to distributors for resale, stores operated by licensees and franchisees, and department stores like Macy's (PVH's top customer) and Dillard's. Tommy Hilfiger products are also sold through joint ventures in such emerging markets as Brazil, China, and India.
  

   Heritage Brands products are distributed wholesale to the likes of Bon-Ton Stores, J. C. Penney, Kohl's, and Sears. Each of the Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Heritage Brands businesses have a number of licensing partners domestically and abroad, who have the right to manufacture and wholesale specified products under one or more brands or are granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name.
  

   PVH targets the marketing of its brands at distinct consumer demographics. The company advertises its brands through digital media (including its e-commerce and social media sites), national print media, television, outdoor signage, special events, promotions, and store locations. It also advertises through product tie-ins and sport sponsorships (Calvin Klein/basketball, Van Heusen/football, and IZOD/golf). The Tommy Hilfiger marketing team also coordinates appearances by the designer himself, Tommy Hilfiger, at runway shows, special events, and flagship store openings.
  

   The company spent $376.6 million on advertising expenses in 2016, down from $384.6 million and $392.5 million, in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  

   PFH's five largest customers account for more than a fifth of total revenues.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's net revenues have been increasing in recent years, until 2016. In fiscal 2016, the company's net revenue decreased by 3% due to a sales drop in Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation from a weaker euro.
  

   The revenues in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1% due to a 5% drop in retail comparable store sales, primarily as a result of the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in US stores located in international tourist locations due to the stronger dollar.
  

   Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenues decreased by 10% (including a 15% negative foreign currency impact).
  

   PFH's net income net income increased by 30% in fiscal 2016, mainly due to higher net revenues and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to lower retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial gains; a 70 basis point reduction due to a lower Warnaco integration and restructuring costs; and a decline in the Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments.
  

   The company's operating cash inflow increased by 14% in fiscal 2015.
  
Strategy

   PVH's strength lies in the fact that it maintains a strong, diversified brand portfolio that is growing through acquisitions and supported by a model that offers multiple brands and product types globally at different price points and across a range of distribution channels -- from retail to licensing -- allowing PVH to reach a broad range of consumers in various geographic regions thus reducing reliance on any one demographic.
  

   The company focuses on reinvesting in businesses and pursuing strategic acquisitions.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2016 the company bought 55% of TH Asia Ltd., its joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China. The acquisition is expected to add $100 million of revenues. With the closing of this transaction, Tommy Hilfiger business now operates directly in its fastest growing market, while leveraging its well-established infrastructure in Asia.

Organization[edit]
PVH Corp has its main headquarters in Manhattan, with administrative offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Additional distribution facilities in the United States are located in Brinkley, Arkansas; McDonough, Georgia; Jonesville, North Carolina; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.[3] The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide[citation needed].
History[edit]
The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones & Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s.
The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[4] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[5]
After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[6] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[7]
On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]
Distribution[edit]
PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein.
The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are about 10,000 square feet (930 m2).[10] Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008.[11][12] Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely.[11][12] The company will continue to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until at least 2013.[11] In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. The Izod Golf line is now available at select Van Heusen stores.
Marketing[edit]
Historically, PVH has not had a strong advertising presence of its own, preferring to let its department store customers market their products within its stores.
On October 4, 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007.[citation needed] The corporation will pay about $1.3 million a year over the next five years for the naming rights, and will handle marketing for arena events.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Environmental practices[edit]
In July 2011, PVH—along with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch—was the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled "Dirty Laundry". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate.[13]

On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]
Distribution[edit]
PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein.
The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are about 10,000 square feet (930 m2).[10] Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008.[11][12] Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely.[11][12] The company will continue to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until at least 2013.[11] In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. The Izod Golf line is now available at select Van Heusen stores.
Marketing[edit]
Historically, PVH has not had a strong advertising presence of its own, preferring to let its department store customers market their products within its stores.
On October 4, 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007.[citation needed] The corporation will pay about $1.3 million a year over the next five years for the naming rights, and will handle marketing for arena events.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Environmental practices[edit]
In July 2011, PVH—along with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch—was the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled "Dirty Laundry". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate.[13]

Organization[edit]
PVH Corp has its main headquarters in Manhattan, with administrative offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Additional distribution facilities in the United States are located in Brinkley, Arkansas; McDonough, Georgia; Jonesville, North Carolina; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.[3] The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide[citation needed].
History[edit]
The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones & Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s.
The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[4] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[5]
After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[6] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[7]
On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]

Organization[edit]
PVH Corp has its main headquarters in Manhattan, with administrative offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Additional distribution facilities in the United States are located in Brinkley, Arkansas; McDonough, Georgia; Jonesville, North Carolina; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.[3] The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide[citation needed].
History[edit]
The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones & Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s.
The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[4] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[5]
After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[6] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[7]
On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]
Distribution[edit]
PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein.
The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are about 10,000 square feet (930 m2).[10] Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008.[11][12] Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely.[11][12] The company will continue to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until at least 2013.[11] In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. The Izod Golf line is now available at select Van Heusen stores.
Marketing[edit]
Historically, PVH has not had a strong advertising presence of its own, preferring to let its department store customers market their products within its stores.
On October 4, 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007.[citation needed] The corporation will pay about $1.3 million a year over the next five years for the naming rights, and will handle marketing for arena events.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Environmental practices[edit]
In July 2011, PVH—along with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch—was the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled "Dirty Laundry". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate.[13]

PVH appears to be a sound bet, given its robust earnings history, favorable estimate revisions, solid bull-run and impressive fundamentals. Backed by these factors, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). So, let’s take a deeper look of these parameters, which have been driving the company with long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%.Robust Earnings History & OutlookWe note that PVH Corp. appears compelling from the earnings perspective, as the company kept its positive surprise streak alive for the 12th straight time in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2017. Notably, in the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.5%.A glimpse of the first quarter reveals that both the top and bottom line advanced year over year, alongside surpassing estimates. In fact, sales also marked its third straight surprise. Results gained from solid momentum at the company’s premium Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, particularly in the international regions. The superb quarter also encouraged management to raise its fiscal 2017 outlook, alongside issuing an impressive view for the second quarter. That said, we believe that PVH Corp. is well positioned to maintain its upbeat performance in future.Favorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing a sturdy performance and encouraging outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an uptrend as analysts raised their estimates.Analysts polled by Zacks are convinced about the stock’s upbeat performance in the future. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 and $7.47 for the second quarter and fiscal 2017 witnessed a jump of 11 cents and 8 cents, respectively. Clearly, a positive sentiment is palpable among analysts covering the stock.PVH Corp. Price and Consensus View photosPVH Corp. Price and Consensus | PVH Corp. QuoteStock MovementWhile this New York-based company has gained 3.1% since the quarterly outcome, the stock has significantly outperformed the Zacks categorized Textile – Apparel Manufacturing industry in the past one year. Evidently, PVH Corp.’s shares jumped 9.2% in the past one year, compared with the industry’s decline of 19%. This is mainly attributable to the company’s robust show even amid an uncertain macro environment. That, in itself, speaks volumes about the company’s ongoing prospects.Apart from the aforementioned factors, PVH Corp. has been riding on its strong fundamentals, which are discussed below.Strong FundamentalsPVH Corp.’s diversified brand portfolio allows it to stay ahead of its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain its position in the current challenging environment. The company’s approach to brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through efficient marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. Based on the strength of many of its brands, particularly Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, along with opportunities with regard to distribution, we believe that the company is poised for long-term growth.Further, the company has been undertaking significant steps to keep pace with the evolving retail trends and integrate consumers’ changing preferences into its operating decisions. In fact, these constant endeavors have helped the company to stay afloat even in a challenging retail landscape.Some recent evidences of PVH’s growth efforts include its latest agreement with Li & Fung, which is likely to enhance the former’s supply-chain network. Moreover, the company recently inked a deal to acquire True&Co, which is a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel online retailer. This deal underscores PVH’s focus on making innovations and developing its omnichannel operations to enrich consumer experience.All said, we believe that PVH Corp. is moving in the right direction and these strategies will help it to exploit opportunities in the lifestyle apparel market. This, combined with the company’s Value Style Score of “B” signal favorable future prospects for the company.Other Stocks in PVH Corp’s SpaceA top-ranked stock in the same industry is Cherokee Inc.

Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH shares jump 5% after J.P. Morgan upgrade
Shares of PVH Corp.  surged 5% Thursday, after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy after better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The apparel company and owner of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands, beat first-quarter per-share earnings estimates by 5 cents, driven by 5% sales growth and 178 basis points of margin expansion, analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a note. In a rare move for a retail company in the current troubled environment, PVH raised its guidance for the second quarter and full year, with the high end of its range pointing to more than 10% EPS growth in the first half. Boss said the company is on track to achieve sustainable double-digit profit growth for several years as forex pressure eases, and Calvin Klein's Europe business improves along with Tommy Hilfiger in China. "Management sees the Tommy Hilfiger brand (~$1.65B revenues, 13-14% EBIT margin) as a benchmark for Calvin Klein's European opportunity (currently ~$700M revenues at 10%EBIT margin) implying Calvin Klein could profitably grow in Europe at a mid-to-high
teens compound annual growth rate for the next 5 to 6 years before reaching Tommy's maturity, complemented by further opportunity in China (mgmt see business doubling over next 3-5 years)," he wrote. Shares have gained 19% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH shares jump 5% after J.P. Morgan upgrade
Shares of PVH Corp.  surged 5% Thursday, after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy after better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The apparel company and owner of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands, beat first-quarter per-share earnings estimates by 5 cents, driven by 5% sales growth and 178 basis points of margin expansion, analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a note. In a rare move for a retail company in the current troubled environment, PVH raised its guidance for the second quarter and full year, with the high end of its range pointing to more than 10% EPS growth in the first half. Boss said the company is on track to achieve sustainable double-digit profit growth for several years as forex pressure eases, and Calvin Klein's Europe business improves along with Tommy Hilfiger in China. "Management sees the Tommy Hilfiger brand (~$1.65B revenues, 13-14% EBIT margin) as a benchmark for Calvin Klein's European opportunity (currently ~$700M revenues at 10%EBIT margin) implying Calvin Klein could profitably grow in Europe at a mid-to-high
teens compound annual growth rate for the next 5 to 6 years before reaching Tommy's maturity, complemented by further opportunity in China (mgmt see business doubling over next 3-5 years)," he wrote. Shares have gained 19% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

The Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, commonly referred to as PVH Corp, is an American clothing company which owns brands such as Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, and licenses brands such as Geoffrey Beene, BCBG Max Azria, Chaps, Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud, Michael Kors, and Speedo (the latter under an exclusive perpetual license from Speedo International for the North American market).
It is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve.[2]

Organization[edit]
PVH Corp has its main headquarters in Manhattan, with administrative offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Additional distribution facilities in the United States are located in Brinkley, Arkansas; McDonough, Georgia; Jonesville, North Carolina; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.[3] The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide[citation needed].
History[edit]
The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones & Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s.
The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[4] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[5]
After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[6] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[7]
On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]
Distribution[edit]
PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein.
The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are about 10,000 square feet (930 m2).[10] Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008.[11][12] Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely.[11][12] The company will continue to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until at least 2013.[11] In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. The Izod Golf line is now available at select Van Heusen stores.
Marketing[edit]
Historically, PVH has not had a strong advertising presence of its own, preferring to let its department store customers market their products within its stores.
On October 4, 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007.[citation needed] The corporation will pay about $1.3 million a year over the next five years for the naming rights, and will handle marketing for arena events.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Environmental practices[edit]
In July 2011, PVH—along with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch—was the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled "Dirty Laundry". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate.[13]

The Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, commonly referred to as PVH Corp, is an American clothing company which owns brands such as Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, and licenses brands such as Geoffrey Beene, BCBG Max Azria, Chaps, Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud, Michael Kors, and Speedo (the latter under an exclusive perpetual license from Speedo International for the North American market).
It is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve.[2]

Organization[edit]
PVH Corp has its main headquarters in Manhattan, with administrative offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California. Additional distribution facilities in the United States are located in Brinkley, Arkansas; McDonough, Georgia; Jonesville, North Carolina; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
PVH has several sourcing facilities worldwide, located in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.[3] The corporation employs over 12,000 people worldwide[citation needed].
History[edit]
The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones & Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s.
The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002.[4] In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump.[5]
After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York.[6] The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement.[7]
On March 15, 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion.[8]
In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the "Van Heusen" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. As of March 2011[update] the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result.
In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only).
In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group.[9] PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants.[5]
Distribution[edit]
PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein.
The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are about 10,000 square feet (930 m2).[10] Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008.[11][12] Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely.[11][12] The company will continue to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until at least 2013.[11] In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. The Izod Golf line is now available at select Van Heusen stores.
Marketing[edit]
Historically, PVH has not had a strong advertising presence of its own, preferring to let its department store customers market their products within its stores.
On October 4, 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007.[citation needed] The corporation will pay about $1.3 million a year over the next five years for the naming rights, and will handle marketing for arena events.[citation needed]
Controversy[edit]
Environmental practices[edit]
In July 2011, PVH—along with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch—was the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled "Dirty Laundry". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate.[13]
