The plaudits are many for George Sledge, physician and researcher at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center: "brilliant scientist," "caring physician," "successful mentor," "inspirational leader." Yet an anecdote relayed by Sledge's colleague Hari Nakshatri is perhaps the most revealing portrayal of all. 

Last summer at a scientific meeting in Orlando, a New York radiation oncologist described one of her patients in a presentation and then reported that she had personally undertaken a national search for the best clinical oncologist to treat that patient. The physician she chose, from all those she could have selected in the United States, was George Sledge.

"George Sledge is one of the most influential figures in breast cancer in our generation," says Jose Baselga, holder of the Bruce A. Chabner Chair in Hematology and Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "He is a gifted clinician, an amazing scientist, and a deep and critical thinker. The depth of his knowledge is legendary." 

For countless women and their families, Sledge is a compassionate doctor providing expert care, a physician who has given women his home phone number and encouraged them to use it.

"George is a consummate clinician," says Kathy Miller, associate professor of medicine and Sheila D. Ward Scholar at the IU School of Medicine. "He continues to serve a large and loyal patient population. Referring physicians seek his advice and counsel regularly.

"I marvel at his ability to explain technically complicated molecular biology to patients and their families. He is an active listener, considering patients' unique fears and goals when formulating their treatment plans. Importantly, George cares deeply about his patients -- celebrating their successes and mourning their losses," Miller says.

Sledge's laboratory has been continuously funded with external grants, and the science that has emerged is on the leading edge, generating more than 245 peer-reviewed scientific papers. He is recognized internationally for his work in developing and testing agents -- notably the drug bevacizumab -- to inhibit angiogenesis, the process by which cancer stimulates the development of blood vessels to support the growth of cancer cells.

Sledge was a leader in the research and clinical trials that established the medication Paclitaxel as an important therapy for metastatic breast cancer. His demonstration that the efficacy, at much lower toxicity, of sequential administration of another drug, Doxorubicin, with Paclitaxel "triggered a profound revision of the therapeutic approach to women with metastatic breast cancer," says Luca Gianni, director of the Department of Medical Oncology at Milan's Istituto Scientifico Universitario San Raffaele.

As leader of the Breast Cancer Program at the IU Simon Cancer Center, Sledge has created a multidisciplinary program of excellence in research and patient care, expanding it to 32 members. In the process Sledge has served as a talented mentor, inspiring young colleagues to do work that has made them national leaders in their cancer research specialties.

He has served tirelessly as a member or chair of numerous study groups and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group clinical trials, and as a member of key research-related committees at the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, and the American Association of Clinical Oncology. His many contributions resulted in his election as president of American Association of Clinical Oncology for 2010-11.

Sledge has received numerous prestigious honors, notably the Komen-Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction from the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in 2006, the Jill Rose Award from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in 2007 and the 2010 William L. McGuire Memorial Lecture Award at the 33rd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

Clifford Hudis, chief of Breast Cancer Medicine Service and professor of medicine at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, captures well Sledge's many contributions: "His is a career marked by service and selflessness. He can be counted upon to confront difficult drug development decisions within both academia and industry; he provides clarity and precision when he teaches; and his specific contributions to the work of the regional scientific community, the national cooperative group system and ASCO all reflect admirable and rarely seen generosity."

Curing Metastatic Breast Cancer.
Journal of oncology practice / American Society of Clinical Oncology

Sledge, G. W.

2016; 12 (1): 6-10


Abstract
Metastatic breast cancer is generally considered incurable, and this colors doctor-patient interactions for patients with metastatic disease. Although true for most patients, there appear to be important exceptions, instances where long-term disease-free survival occurs. Although these instances are few in number, they suggest the possibility of cure. How will we move toward cure for a much larger population of patients with metastatic disease? This article outlines a potential research agenda that might move us toward that distant goal.

Targeted Therapy for Cancer in the Genomic Era.
Cancer journal 

Afghahi, A., Sledge, G. W.

2015; 21 (4): 294-298


Abstract
The advent of cancer genomics has led to the development of many highly successful targeted therapies, primarily inhibitors of growth factor receptors and related kinases, including imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. This approach has become highly successful for certain cancers. However, as the list of targeted therapies expands, their efficacy becomes more limited, and toxicity accumulates. What we have learned in the past decades is that while the targeted therapeutics approach may be highly successful in less complex tumors, cancers defined by carcinogen-induced genomic chaos, such a UV-induced melanoma or tobacco-induced lung cancer, are driven by a multitude of competing molecular pathways and, as such, are not as successfully managed by a similar approach. Luckily, in the past years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has become more fully developed with the emergence of checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy. These promising new agents are particularly well suited for tumors with a high mutational burden due to underlying genomic disarray. While still in its infancy, we predict that cancer immunotherapy will offer a better alternative to our current targeted approach and eagerly await the results of several ongoing clinical trials that will elucidate this new direction in cancer therapy.

"Vertical" Inhibition of HER2 Yields Horizontal Gains in the Clinic.
Clinical cancer research 

Sledge, G. W., Pegram, M. D.

2015; 21 (12): 2663-2665


Abstract
HER2-targeted therapy has moved beyond trastuzumab to include other monoclonals targeting the cell surface, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors of HER2, and antibody-drug conjugates. Afatinib, a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, now joins the ranks of HER2-targeting agents in combination with trastuzumab. The combination brings new opportunities and challenges.

Abstract
To develop a genomic signature that predicts benefit from trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer.DASL technology was used to quantify mRNA in samples from 1,282 patients enrolled onto the Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Breast Cancer (North Central Cancer Treatment Group N9831 [NCCTG-N9831]) adjuvant trastuzumab trial. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for significant clinicopathologic risk factors, were used to determine the association of each gene with relapse-free survival (RFS) for 433 patients who received chemotherapy alone (arm A) and 849 patients who received chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (arms B and C). Network and pathway analyses were used to identify key biologic processes linked to RFS. The signature was built by using a voting scheme.Network and functional ontology analyses suggested that increased RFS was linked to a subset of immune function genes. A voting scheme model was used to define immune gene enrichment based on the expression of any nine or more of 14 immune function genes at or above the 0.40 quantile for the population. This model was used to identify immune gene-enriched tumors in arm A and arms B and C. Immune gene enrichment was linked to increased RFS in arms B and C (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.55; P < .001), whereas arm B and C patients who did not exhibit immune gene enrichment did not benefit from trastuzumab (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.28; P = .53). Enriched immune function gene expression as defined by our predictive signature was not associated with increased RFS in arm A (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.37; P = .64).Increased expression of a subset of immune function genes may provide a means of predicting benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab.

Predicting early brain metastases based on clinicopathological factors and gene expression analysis in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients
JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY

Duchnowska, R., Jassem, J., Goswami, C. P., Dundar, M., Goekmen-Polar, Y., Li, L., Woditschka, S., Biernat, W., Sosinska-Mielcarek, K., Czartoryska-Arlukowicz, B., Radecka, B., Tomasevic, Z., Stepniak, P., Wojdan, K., Sledge, G. W., Steeg, P. S., Badve, S.

2015; 122 (1): 205-216


Abstract
The overexpression or amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene (HER2/neu) is associated with high risk of brain metastasis (BM). The identification of patients at highest immediate risk of BM could optimize screening and facilitate interventional trials. We performed gene expression analysis using complementary deoxyribonucleic acid-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in primary tumor samples from two independent cohorts of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Additionally, we analyzed predictive relevance of clinicopathological factors in this series. Study group included discovery Cohort A (84 patients) and validation Cohort B (75 patients). The only independent variables associated with the development of early BM in both cohorts were the visceral location of first distant relapse [Cohort A: hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95 % CI 2.4-22.3; p < 0.001; Cohort B: HR 6.1, 95 % CI 1.5-25.6; p = 0.01] and the lack of trastuzumab administration in the metastatic setting (Cohort A: HR 5.0, 95 % CI 1.4-10.0; p = 0.009; Cohort B: HR 10.0, 95 % CI 2.0-100.0; p = 0.008). A profile including 13 genes was associated with early (≤36 months) symptomatic BM in the discovery cohort. This was refined by qRT-PCR to a 3-gene classifier (RAD51, HDGF, TPR) highly predictive of early BM (HR 5.3, 95 % CI 1.6-16.7; p = 0.005; multivariate analysis). However, predictive value of the classifier was not confirmed in the independent validation Cohort B. The presence of visceral metastases and the lack of trastuzumab administration in the metastatic setting apparently increase the likelihood of early BM in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

The future of breast cancer systemic therapy: the next 10 years.
Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)

Telli, M. L., Sledge, G. W.

2015; 93 (2): 119-125


Abstract
Over the past 50 years, substantial progress has been made in the systemic treatment of early-stage and advanced breast cancer. The use of chemotherapy in the adjuvant and metastatic settings has demonstrated proven efficacy and it has been clearly demonstrated that targeting the estrogen receptor and human growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is efficacious in early and advanced disease. Despite these advances, vexing clinical challenges remain particularly related to the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; estrogen receptor [ER]-negative, progesterone receptor [PR]-negative, and HER2-negative) where little progress has been made therapeutically in more than a decade. While recurrences of hormone-responsive breast cancer are overall less common, late relapses after cessation of endocrine therapy are a more frequent occurrence in modern times and reflect the problem of underlying tumor dormancy that as yet has not been overcome. Multiple molecular tools are now available to interrogate the biology of breast cancer, though exactly how to make this information meaningful in the clinic has proven challenging, and molecularly driven clinical trials have faced feasibility challenges. In parallel, focus has expanded from tumor to host with the ability to ascertain underlying germline alterations, such as inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which may be responsible for breast cancer carcinogenesis and, importantly, may have implications for treatment. These clinical advances in germline genetics, made possible by both scientific investigation as well as the courts, still face challenges related to increasing encounters with variants of unknown significance and difficulty in predicting risks associated with less well-characterized inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. In this paper, we attempt to predict the next 10 years of breast cancer, in particular focusing on how the past serves as prologue to the future in this disease.

Treatment-associated musculoskeletal and vasomotor symptoms and relapse-free survival in the NCIC CTG MA.27 adjuvant breast cancer aromatase inhibitor trial.
Journal of clinical oncology 

Stearns, V., Chapman, J. W., Ma, C. X., Ellis, M. J., Ingle, J. N., Pritchard, K. I., Budd, G. T., Rabaglio, M., Sledge, G. W., Le Maitre, A., Kundapur, J., Liedke, P. E., Shepherd, L. E., Goss, P. E.

2015; 33 (3): 265-271


Abstract
Treatment-emergent symptoms with adjuvant tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been associated with superior recurrence-free survival (RFS). We hypothesized that MA.27 anastrozole- or exemestane-treated patients with new or worsening vasomotor and/or joint symptoms would have improved RFS.MA.27 randomly assigned 7,576 postmenopausal women with breast cancer to 5 years of anastrozole or exemestane. Patient-reported symptoms were collected using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 at protocol-specified baseline and 6- and 12-month clinical visits. Symptoms were considered present with either vasomotor and/or joint complaints. Associations between symptoms and baseline patient characteristics were examined with χ(2) and Fisher's exact tests. Subsequent effects of new or worsening symptoms on RFS were examined with landmark analyses and stratified univariable and multivariable Cox models. We examined the effects of 3-month symptoms arising from unplanned clinic visits as a result of severe toxicity.Patients were assessable if eligible for the MA.27 trial, received some trial therapy, and had no disease recurrence at the end of a symptom assessment period; 96% of patients (n = 7,306 patients) were included at 6 months, and 96% (n = 7,246) were included at 12 months. Thirty-four percent of patients had baseline symptoms. For patients without baseline symptoms, 25% and 52% had new symptoms by 6 and 12 months, respectively. Neither treatment-emergent nor baseline symptoms significantly impacted RFS (P > .10) in patients with or without baseline symptoms.In MA.27, anastrozole or exemestane treatment-emergent symptoms were not associated with improved RFS. Women should be supported through treatment and encouraged to remain on their AI regardless of their symptoms.

Abstract
Positive interim analysis findings from four large adjuvant trials evaluating trastuzumab in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer were first reported in 2005. One of these reports, the joint analysis of North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG N9831 (Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project NSABP B-31 (Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2), was updated in 2011. We now report the planned definitive overall survival (OS) results from this joint analysis along with updates on the disease-free survival (DFS) end point.In all, 4,046 patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were enrolled to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in both trials. The required number of events for the definitive statistical analysis for OS (710 events) was reached in September 2012. Updated analyses of overall DFS and related subgroups were also performed.Median time on study was 8.4 years. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.73; P < .001) and an increase in 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%. These results were accompanied by an improvement in DFS of 40% (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.68; P < .001) and increase in 10-year DFS rate from 62.2% to 73.7%. All patient subgroups benefited from addition of this targeted anti-HER2 agent.The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer results in a substantial and durable improvement in survival as a result of a sustained marked reduction in cancer recurrence.

Abstract
Bevacizumab has broad anti-tumour activity, but substantial risk of hypertension. No reliable markers are available for predicting bevacizumab-induced hypertension.A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in the phase III bevacizumab-based adjuvant breast cancer trial, ECOG-5103, to evaluate for an association between genotypes and hypertension. GWAS was conducted in those who had experienced systolic blood pressure (SBP) >160 mm Hg during therapy using binary analysis and a cumulative dose model for the total exposure of bevacizumab. Common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3-5 hypertension was also assessed. Candidate SNP validation was performed in the randomised phase III trial, ECOG-2100.When using the phenotype of SBP>160 mm Hg, the most significant association in SV2C (rs6453204) approached and met genome-wide significance in the binary model (P=6.0 × 10(-8); OR=3.3) and in the cumulative dose model (P=4.7 × 10(-8); HR=2.2), respectively. Similar associations with rs6453204 were seen for CTC grade 3-5 hypertension but did not meet genome-wide significance. Validation study from ECOG-2100 demonstrated a statistically significant association between this SNP and grade 3/4 hypertension using the binary model (P-value=0.037; OR=2.4).A genetic variant in SV2C predicted clinically relevant bevacizumab-induced hypertension in two independent, randomised phase III trials.

Improving the quality of cancer care in America through health information technology.
Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 

Feeley, T. W., Sledge, G. W., Levit, L., Ganz, P. A.

2014; 21 (5): 772-775


Abstract
A recent report from the Institute of Medicine titled Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis, identifies improvement in information technology (IT) as essential to improving the quality of cancer care in America. The report calls for implementation of a learning healthcare IT system: a system that supports patient-clinician interactions by providing patients and clinicians with the information and tools necessary to make well informed medical decisions and to support quality measurement and improvement. While some elements needed for a learning healthcare system are already in place for cancer, they are incompletely implemented, have functional deficiencies, and are not integrated in a way that creates a true learning healthcare system. To achieve the goal of a learning cancer care delivery system, clinicians, professional organizations, government, and the IT industry will have to partner, develop, and incentivize participation.

Abstract
Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the brain, colonizing a neuro-inflammatory microenvironment. The molecular pathways facilitating this colonization remain poorly understood.Expression profiling of 23 matched sets of human resected brain metastases and primary breast tumors by two-sided paired t test was performed to identify brain metastasis-specific genes. The implicated DNA repair genes BARD1 and RAD51 were modulated in human (MDA-MB-231-BR) and murine (4T1-BR) brain-tropic breast cancer cell lines by lentiviral transduction of cDNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) coding sequences. Their functional contribution to brain metastasis development was evaluated in mouse xenograft models (n = 10 mice per group).Human brain metastases overexpressed BARD1 and RAD51 compared with either matched primary tumors (1.74-fold, P < .001; 1.46-fold, P < .001, respectively) or unlinked systemic metastases (1.49-fold, P = .01; 1.44-fold, P = .008, respectively). Overexpression of either gene in MDA-MB-231-BR cells increased brain metastases by threefold to fourfold after intracardiac injections, but not lung metastases upon tail-vein injections. In 4T1-BR cells, shRNA-mediated RAD51 knockdown reduced brain metastases by 2.5-fold without affecting lung metastasis development. In vitro, BARD1- and RAD51-overexpressing cells showed reduced genomic instability but only exhibited growth and colonization phenotypes upon DNA damage induction. Reactive oxygen species were present in tumor cells and elevated in the metastatic neuro-inflammatory microenvironment and could provide an endogenous source of genotoxic stress. Tempol, a brain-permeable oxygen radical scavenger suppressed brain metastasis promotion induced by BARD1 and RAD51 overexpression.BARD1 and RAD51 are frequently overexpressed in brain metastases from breast cancer and may constitute a mechanism to overcome reactive oxygen species-mediated genotoxic stress in the metastatic brain.

Abstract
This study aimed to investigate whether pre-chemotherapy anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) is a biomarker for chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA) in breast cancer patients. A multicenter randomized controlled trial, ECOG5103, assigned patients with early stage breast cancer to standard doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with either placebo or one of two durations of bevacizumab therapy. Five hundred ninety-one patients were part of the decision-making/quality of life substudy, in which there were surveys from baseline through 18-month follow-up. One hundred twenty-four women were included in this analysis of menses data because they were premenopausal at enrollment, responded to the 12-month survey, had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian function suppression before that survey, and had serum banked for research before chemotherapy. One hundred of the 124 also responded to the 18-month survey. Median age was 45 years (range 25-55), and median serum AMH level was 0.11 ng/mL (range 0.01-8.63) prior to treatment. Eighty-two percent had CRA at 12 months, and 81 % at 18 months. In multivariate analyses, older age (p = 0.0003) was the only statistically significant predictor of 12-month CRA, but at 18-months, lower pre-chemotherapy AMH (p = 0.04) and older age (p = 0.008) were both statistically significant predictors of CRA. Race, bevacizumab therapy, and tamoxifen use were not statistically significantly associated with CRA after adjustment for AMH and age. Pre-chemotherapy AMH level is a potential novel biomarker for CRA in premenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. Further research to evaluate the clinical utility of AMH testing is warranted.

Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a heterogeneous set of tumors defined by an absence of actionable therapeutic targets (ER, PR, and HER-2). Microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers represents a novel comparator to reveal insights into TNBC heterogeneity and to inform drug development. Using RNA-sequencing data from our institution and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we compared the transcriptomes of 94 TNBCs, 20 microdissected normal breast tissues from healthy volunteers from the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank, and 10 histologically normal tissues adjacent to tumor. Pathway analysis comparing TNBCs to optimized normal controls of microdissected normal epithelium versus classic controls composed of adjacent normal tissue revealed distinct molecular signatures. Differential gene expression of TNBC compared with normal comparators demonstrated important findings for TNBC-specific clinical trials testing targeted agents; lack of over-expression for negative studies and over-expression in studies with drug activity. Next, by comparing each individual TNBC to the set of microdissected normals, we demonstrate that TNBC heterogeneity is attributable to transcriptional chaos, is associated with non-silent DNA mutational load, and explains transcriptional heterogeneity in addition to known molecular subtypes. Finally, chaos analysis identified 146 core genes dysregulated in >90 % of TNBCs revealing an over-expressed central network. In conclusion, use of microdissected normal ductal epithelium from healthy volunteers enables an optimized approach for studying TNBC and uncovers biological heterogeneity mediated by transcriptional chaos.

WINNER: Advancements in Health Care

George W. Sledge Jr., MD

	If you ask George Sledge why he became an oncologist, he doesn’t hesitate. He can tell you exactly when he knew that’s what he wanted to do. While an intern at St. Louis University, he had to inform a young mother that she had leukemia. “I’ll always remember what Carmelita asked me,” Sledge said. “She asked, ‘Who will take care of my children?’” That had a huge emotional impact on me.”

	After completing his residency, Sledge, 59, went on to complete an oncology fellowship at the University of Texas in San Antonio, studying for several years under nationally known breast cancer researcher Bill McGuire.

	When Sledge came to IU in 1983, he was the only oncologist with expertise in the area of breast cancer, and it was under his leadership that IU opened its first breast clinic.

	That’s where he’s made his mark in medical research, developing life enhancing treatments and cancer-care protocols that have improved the care and outcomes of breast cancer patients.

	One area of research Sledge is involved with is biologic treatments for breast cancer, especially anti-angiogenic therapies, such as the drug Avastin. Anti-angiogenic therapies prevent the development of new blood vessels or stunt new blood vessel growth in cancer cells, consequently starving them. Sledge also conducted studies involving the drug Herceptin, used in conjunction with chemotherapy to help prolong the lives of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.

	Perhaps Sledge’s most far-reaching contribution to breast cancer research was with Taxol, a chemotherapy treatment. He led the first major trial in the use of Taxol as a treatment for breast cancer. The Phase III trial lasted from 1993 to 1997, with institutions nationwide participating. As a result, Taxol is now commonly used by many breast cancer patients. The findings from this trial also demonstrated that sequential use of chemotherapies, which is much less toxic and easier for patients to tolerate, was just as beneficial as using chemotherapies in tandem.

	“Drugs like Avastin, Herceptin and Taxol are valuable to the extent that they prolong women’s lives, first and foremost,” Sledge said. “So my career as a breast cancer researcher has been designed in large part to try and develop new agents that will prolong women’s lives, and hopefully, when applied to women with early-stage breast cancer, increase their cure rate.”

	As co-director of IU’s Breast Cancer Program, Sledge leads a breast cancer research team of more than 30 members. The program has produced several patents and two startup companies and is involved in more than 70 clinical trials. Its annual research grant funding now exceeds $11 million, and it received a $20 million gift from the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer Research.

	“During the most recent review from the National Cancer Institute, the Breast Cancer research program at the IU Simon Cancer Center earned one of the National Cancer Institute’s highest rankings,” said Patrick Loehrer Sr., director of the IU Simon Cancer Center. “This doesn’t just happen by chance. It is a result of the hard work of George and his many colleagues from numerous disciplines. Together, they continue to make a mark worldwide by improving the prognosis of breast cancer and increasing not only the duration of life, but also the quality of life for women with this disease.”

	Over the years Sledge has received several prestigious national awards, such as the 2010 William L. McGuire Memorial Lecture Award at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the 2007 Rose Award from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and the 2006 Brinker Award from the Komen Foundation.

	Sledge has also provided leadership for numerous organizations, including the FDA’s Oncology Drug Advisory Committee, Hoosier Oncology Group, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group’s Breast Cancer Committee and the Department of Defense Oncology Drug Advisory Committee. He currently serves as president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

	While awards and recognition are nice, Sledge considers his greatest achievement being able to help his patients, and the beast cancer program is the vehicle that allows him to do it.

	“Like most doctors, what drives me when I get up in the morning and what keeps me going during a very long day is my ability to help my patients,” Sledge said. “I hope to continue to help the women of central Indiana live better lives through the application of cutting-edge research so they will have a chance to be first in line for new therapies, new drugs and new developments that will prolong their lives and minimize or eliminate their suffering.”

	After all these years, he’s still trying to ensure the “Carmelitas” under his care will live to raise their children.

	“In the breast cancer research world, George Sledge is a rock star,” Loehrer said. “But he goes about his work in a down-to-earth manner, whether he’s talking with a patient, teaching younger scientists or doing an interview with the national media. To us at the IU Simon Cancer Center and to his patients, George is a true hero.”•

WALTHAM, Mass., Feb. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., today announced the appointment of distinguished breast cancer specialist, George W. Sledge, Jr., M.D., to its board of directors as an independent director. Dr. Sledge is currently professor and chief of medical oncology at Stanford University Medical Center. He specializes in the study and treatment of breast cancer and directed the first large, nationwide study on the use of paclitaxel to treat advanced breast cancer. He served as chairman of the Breast Committee of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (now called ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group) from 2002 - 2009, where he played an important role in the development of several nationwide clinical trials. He has published over 280 articles in medical journals about breast cancer and chaired several nationwide clinical trials involving new breast cancer treatments.
"Dr. Sledge is a preeminent breast cancer researcher and clinician and his experience with ECOG and in other settings in directing and evaluating clinical trials for breast cancer therapies will be invaluable to Syndax as it evaluates the combination of entinostat with hormone therapy in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for metastatic breast cancer. Syndax will benefit enormously from the experience and perspective that George brings to the company," said Luke Evnin, Ph.D., a member of Syndax's board of directors.
Dr. Sledge serves as editor-in-chief of the journal Clinical Breast Cancer and is a past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). He has also been chair of ASCO's Education Committee, a member of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program's Integration Panel, a member of the Food and Drug Administration's Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) and a member of the External Advisory Committee for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.
Dr. Sledge was awarded the Hope Funds for Cancer Research 2013 Award of Excellence for Medicine, received the 2006 Komen Foundation Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction, the 2007 Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Jill Rose Award and in 2010 was awarded the William L. McGuire Award from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.
Dr. Sledge holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a medical degree from the Tulane University School of Medicine. He completed his training in internal medicine at St. Louis University and specialty training in medical oncology at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
