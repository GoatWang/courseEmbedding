                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Takes Various Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Takes Various Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-1
    





June 14, 2016 11:46 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust 2004-1 (SLM 2004-1):
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 'AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-5 AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class A-6 'AAAsf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class B 'Asf' maintained on Rating Watch Negative.
    

      Maintenance of the Rating Watch Negative on the class A-4, A-5, A-6 and 
      B notes is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses necessary 
      to maintain their current ratings of 'AAAsf' and 'Asf', respectively. On 
      Dec. 4, 2015, Fitch released an exposure draft that delineates revisions 
      it plans to make to the 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan 
      Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated June 23, 2014.
    

      This transaction was reviewed under both the existing criteria and 
      exposure draft. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch Negative 
      status once its revised FFELP criteria report is published.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral comprises Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. 
      Fitch's current U.S. sovereign rating is 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      excess spread and for the class A notes, subordination provided by the 
      class B notes. As of March 2016, Fitch calculated effective total parity 
      (which includes the reserve fund) is 100.38% and senior parity is 
      104.92% (4.69% CE). Cash is being released from the trust given that the 
      100% total parity ratio (excluding the reserve) is maintained.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve 
      account, sized at its floor of $3,007,834.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by 
      Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch 
      believes Navient is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      In certain LIBOR-down interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread 
      may be compressed, as Fitch would apply a floor to one-month LIBOR at a 
      negative rate level in accordance with Fitch's 'Criteria for Interest 
      Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds' (May 
      2016). Since the updated interest rate stresses are not addressed yet in 
      existing FFELP criteria, this represents a criteria variation. Use of 
      the criteria variation did not have a measurable impact upon the ratings 
      assigned.
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated May 14, 2014, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are 
      those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested 
      for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch doesn't believe such variation has a measurable impact upon 
      the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a build-up of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

THE TRUST
STUDENT LOAN POOL

 

The trust
student loans owned by the trust were originally selected from a
portfolio of consolidation student loans owned by Student Loan
Marketing Association by employing several criteria, including
requirements that each trust student loan as of the original
statistical cutoff date (and with respect to each additional trust
student loan as of its related subsequent cutoff date):

·

was
guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency under
a guarantee agreement and the guaranty agency was, in turn,
reinsured by the Department of Education in accordance with the
FFELP;

·

contained terms
in accordance with those required by the FFELP, the guarantee
agreements and other applicable requirements;

·

was
more than 30 days past the final disbursement;

·

was
not more than 210 days past due;

·

did
not have a borrower who was noted in the related records of the
servicer as being currently involved in a bankruptcy proceeding;
and

·

had
special allowance payments, if any, based on the three-month
commercial paper rate or the 91-day Treasury bill rate.

 

No
trust student loan as of the applicable cutoff date was subject to
any prior obligation to sell that loan to a third party.

 

Unless
otherwise specified, all information with respect to the trust
student loans is presented as of July 1, 2010, which is the
statistical disclosure date.

 

The following
tables provide a description of specified characteristics of the
trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date.
 The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loans in
each of the following tables includes the principal balance due
from borrowers, plus accrued interest of $2,699,463 to be
capitalized as of the statistical disclosure date.
 Percentages and dollar amounts in any table may not total
100% or whole dollars due to rounding.  The following tables
also contain information concerning the total number of loans and
total number of borrowers in the portfolio of trust student loans.
 For ease of administration, the servicer separates a
consolidation loan on its system into two separate loan segments
representing subsidized and unsubsidized segments of the same loan.
 The following tables reflect those loan segments within the
number of loans.  In addition, 50 borrowers have more than one
trust student loan.

 

The
distribution by weighted average interest rate applicable to the
trust student loans on any date following the statistical
disclosure date may vary significantly from that in the following
tables as a result of variations in the effective rates of interest
applicable to the trust student loans and in rates of principal
reduction.  Moreover, the information below about the weighted
average remaining term to maturity of the trust student loans as of
the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from the
actual term to maturity of any of the trust student loans as a
result of prepayments or the granting of deferment and forbearance
periods.

We
determined the weighted average remaining term to maturity shown in
the table from the statistical disclosure date to the stated
maturity date of the applicable trust student loan without giving
effect to any deferment or forbearance periods that may be granted
in the future.  See Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing
memorandum.

 

The weighted
average annual borrower interest rate shown in the table is
exclusive of special allowance payments.  The weighted average
spread for special allowance payments to the 91-day Treasury bill
rate was 3.11% as of the statistical disclosure date.

 

The weighted
average spread for special allowance payments to the three-month
commercial paper rate was 2.64% as of the statistical disclosure
date.  See “Special Allowance Payments” in
Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing memorandum.

 

For this
purpose, the three-month commercial paper rate is the average of
the bond equivalent rates of the three-month commercial paper
(financial) rates in effect for each of the days in a calendar
quarter as reported by the Federal Reserve in Publication H.15 (or
its successor) for that calendar quarter.  The 91-day Treasury
bill rate is the weighted average per annum discount rate,
expressed on a bond equivalent basis and applied on a daily basis,
for direct obligations of the United States with a maturity of

We
determined the interest rates shown in the table above using the
interest rates applicable to the trust student loans as of the
statistical disclosure date.  Because trust student loans with
different interest rates are likely to be repaid at different
rates, this information is not likely to remain applicable to the
trust student loans after the statistical disclosure date.
 See Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing memorandum and
“The Student Loan Pools – The Student Loan Marketing
Association’s Student Loan Financing Business” in

Current
borrower payment status refers to the status of the borrower of
each trust student loan as of the statistical disclosure date.
 The borrower:

 

·

may
have temporarily ceased repaying the loan through a
deferment or a forbearance period; or

 

·

may
be currently required to repay the loan – repayment
.

 

See Appendix A
to the preliminary remarketing memorandum and “The Student
Loan Pools – The Student Loan Marketing Association’s
Student Loan Financing Business” in the
prospectus.

 

The weighted
average number of months in repayment for all trust student loans
currently in repayment is approximately 59.9 calculated as the term
to maturity at the commencement of repayment less the number of
months remaining to scheduled maturity as of the statistical
disclosure date.

We
have determined the scheduled weighted average remaining months in
status shown in the previous table without giving effect to any
deferment or forbearance periods that may be granted in the future.
 Of the $120,295,459 aggregate outstanding principal balance
of the trust student loans in deferment as of the statistical
disclosure date, $60,040,413 or approximately 49.9% of such loans
are to borrowers who had not graduated as of that date.  We
expect that a significant portion of these loans could qualify for
additional deferments or forbearances at the end of their current
deferment periods as the related borrowers continue their education
beyond their current degree programs.  As a result, the
overall duration of any applicable deferment and forbearance
periods as well as the likelihood of future deferment and
forbearance periods within this pool of trust student loans is
likely to be higher than in other pools of student loans without
similar numbers of in-school consolidation loans.  See
Appendix A to the preliminary remarketing memorandum.
