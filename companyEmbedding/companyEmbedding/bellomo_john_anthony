      CHIN'S 20M EMPIRE  
INDICTMENT DETAILS GENOVESE CHARGES CHIN'S 20M EMPIRE  
INDICTMENT DETAILS GENOVESE CHARGES   BY  Greg B. Smith  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, June 12, 1996, 12:00 AM     facebook   Tweet   email        BY  Greg B. Smith  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, June 12, 1996, 12:00 AM    A crippling indictment against the Genovese crime family yesterday showed America's most powerful mob clan pocketed $20 million through a catalogue of crimes  right down to stealing bills off the Feast of San Gennaro statue. 
  The family's regular pillaging of Little Italy's autumn street festival was just the most outrageous act in a 60-count racketeering indictment unveiled yesterday in Manhattan Federal Court. 
  "This investigation showed how the Genovese crime family used a religious institution to mask the object of its true devotion, which is the almighty dollar," said James Kallstrom, head of the FBI's New York office. 
  The biggest catch in the series of arrests launched from the indictment was Liborio (Barney) Bellomo, a 39-year-old Bronx garbage hauler, who allegedly runs the family as acting boss while the real boss, Vincent (Chin) Gigante, fights federal charges in Brooklyn. 
  Lawyers for Gigante, who walks the streets in a bathrobe, claim their client is incompetent to stand trial. 
  By early yesterday, proud investigators from the FBI and NYPD said they had arrested 17 of the 19 defendants without incident. 
   "It was the largest organized crime family in the United States," said Kallstrom. "This is one family we didn't have a lot of success against. 
  "They were fairly sophisticated, kept their heads low, were fairly disciplined," he said. 
  The indictments paint a sprawling portrait of Chin's empire, alleging the Genoveses controlled the San Gennaro festival for years through the purportedly nonprofit San Gennaro Society. 
  Mayor Giuliani's chief of staff, Randy Mastro, said yesterday it was a "virtual certainty" that the city would deny a permit to the society to run this year's event in September. 
  Beyond the festival, the indictments showed Genovese gangsters also ran loansharking operations, stole heavy construction equipment, robbed banks and even illegally pocketed veterans benefits. 
  They shook down companies doing business with Local 46 of Mason Tenders and Local 707 of the Teamsters, and they extorted payments from a Connecticut recycling firm called Enviro Express and the Queens-based New York Tech Windows, officials said. 
  In their two-year probe, the feds and New York City cops were able to tap phones and monitor the homes and social clubs to bring down Bellomo and his underlings.  
  In one case, they watched reputed associate John (Big John) Schenone steal a Caterpillar front-end loader from a Whitestone, Queens, lot during the day. The multi-ton rig was to be shipped to the Dominican Republic. 
  Reputed associate Thomas Barrett allegedly dreamed up one of the largest heists in New York history  a pre-Christmas 1993 raid at a midtown Chemical Bank in which $1.4 million was stolen. 
  Barrett remains a fugitive. 
  The family was also not above committing murder, according to the indictment.  
  The feds charged Genovese consigliere James (Little Jimmy) Ida, who allegedly favors Harley Davidsons to the traditional black La Cosa Nostra Lincolns, participated in the Nov. 25, 1988, murder of a suspected informant, Antonio (Hickey) DiLorenzo. 
  Bellomo, alleged underboss Michele (Mickey Dimino) Generoso and Ida are also charged with ordering the murder of another suspected informant, Ralph Desimone.  
  His body was found stuffed in the trunk of his Lincoln at LaGuardia Airport on June 12, 1991. 
  Bellomo, Generoso and Ida were all held on pending bail applications. Each faces life in the murder counts.

 John Anthony La Dame Michele Blanc De Noirs 
 "Our inaugural release of sparkling wine made entirely from Pinot Noir.  A delicate peach and rose petal color with a heady bouquet of rhubarb and orchard fruit that is complemented by dried floral notes and sweet baking spices.  The wine is bright and energetic upon entry with white raspberry, blood orange and stone fruit flavors that confirm the resulting complexity from additional time on the skins.  Ginger, cardamom and beurre Suzette offer a dry finality to the initial fruitiness.  A luxurious texture is balanced by a lively finish that invites you to return for another sip."
