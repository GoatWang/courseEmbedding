SharePoint 2010's mainstream support 

SharePoint 2010's
mainstream support by Microsoft was ended and there will be only security
related patches and hot fixes available for SharePoint 2010 Service Pack 1

Product related issues will not be fixed by Microsoft so far for SharePoint
2010 technologies, Only premier support only available for customers.

When the product moves
into Extended Support, security updates are no longer issued, and the company
charges for all support calls related to the software.  Charging for support
calls is one of the most important aspects that differentiates Extended Support
from Mainstream Support, and is one of the most significant issues facing
SharePoint 2010 users. Currently, SharePoint users are governed by the
following "support" calendar:

TitleDevelopment of a Novel Si-Modified Zn-Al Eutectoid Alloy for Hot-Dip Batch GalvanizingAuthor InfoJoshi, Abhay VikasSocial Media

Abstract


The hot dip galvanizing process facilitates a combination of good strength and toughness of the substrate with excellent resistance to corrosion provided by the coating through a simple and economic technique. There are two broad categories to this process; the continuous hot- dip galvanizing process and the batch hot-dip galvanizing process. The batch process is particularly important for preformed members or structures. Along with improvement in the life of galvanized steel, there is a growing environmental concern about leaching of zinc into the soil, and this project was an attempt to address this issue. Intensive research has resulted in successful development of new products like Galvanneal®, Galfan® and Galvalume® in recent years, which are produced through the continuous galvanizing process. These products have varying degree of aluminum in the galvanizing bath. There has not been much development in the batch process, mainly due to the restrictions imposed by the process itself, and due to the incompatibility of the conventional zinc-ammonium-chloride flux with baths containing high aluminum content. A novel Cu-Fe and Cu-Sn chloride-free fluxes were therefore developed first, which work satisfactorily with baths containing Al as high as 50%. Prior research work on the Zn-22.3 wt% Al alloy showed that the galvanized coatings obtained from the binary Zn-Al eutectoid bath were an order thicker than the commercially acceptable norm of approximately 80 ìm and the coating surface was rough and the coatings showed a lot of trapped porosities and outbursts. The ternary additions of Bi and RE in the Zn-Al eutectoid bath were made in order to control the thicknesses of the coatings, but with limited success. Ternary addition of 0.2-0.4 wt% Si in the Zn-Al eutectoid bath had beneficial influence on the growth rate and morphology of the coatings. A coating as thin as 10-40 ìm could be achieved. The porosities in the coatings were totally eliminated but the outbursts although, greatly reduced, were still a cause of concern. However, the Si-treated Zn-Al eutectoid bath emerged by far as the most promising alloy for hot-dip galvanizing of steel. Dr. W. van Ooij on behalf of the University of Cincinnati and Weert Groep, requested the assistance and galvanizing expertise of Teck Cominco Ltd. Product Technology Center (PTC) in completing the development of this alloy, understanding the underlying principles and scaling-up the development work from small laboratory furnaces to larger crucibles for dipping trials. Following the agreement between the three parties a joint project was started at PTC from 22nd June, 2005 until 20th September, 2005. The novel Cu-Sn and Cu-Fe fluxes were found to be ineffective during the initial stages of the work. A modified Zn Ammonium Chloride flux developed by PTC and Ferrotech Inc. was used and it was found to be working with this high Al bath. The thesis work was focused towards development and optimization of the experimental matrix to assess the effects of pretreatment chemistries, bath temperature, bath composition, immersion time and withdrawal rates on the coating quality. Evaluation and understanding of the coating properties was accomplished by doing in depth characterization of the coatings, produced at PTC, in the Advanced Materials Characterization Center at The University of Cincinnati. The thesis traverses through the study of the working mechanism of the Si modified Zn-Al alloy in an attempt to completely eliminate the outbursts observed on the coating surface and to produce a commercially acceptable coating quality.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
