On An Individual Basis


M&R Capital Management is a wealth management firm serving individuals, family offices as well as endowments 
			and other institutions. Our investment professionals have decades of investment experience providing advice and 
			helping implement innovative investment strategies.


















Company History
Our firm was founded in 1993 by John Maloney and Richard Diver. The firm has grown over the years and has adapted to the changing opportunities in the wealth management business. We have increased the number of products we offer our clients and value our role as a large and mid-size capitalization investor. 

Vision
We pride ourselves with our abilities in working closely with our clients as we identify and implement their investment objectives. As our firm continues to grow, we will build upon our core principles that help our clients attain their objectives.

 Philosophy
We identify opportunities in publicly traded securities that are trading at a discount to our estimate of their underlying value. Over time, equities offer greater appreciation potential than other investments.

At M&R Capital, we work with a wide variety of clients, many going back to the time the firm was founded. Our investment professionals are committed to the long-term success of our clients and their families. One of our many objectives is helping our clients maintain their standard of living. A number of them have placed virtually all of their investible assets with us and some have been with us for over 25 years (via predecessor firms.) We strive to preserve and increase clients wealth for present and future generations.
Technology
 We employ the Advent / Axys portfolio reporting system for our quarterly reports to clients. This system is an all encompassing report system that provides clients with detailed reports related to performance, realized gains and portfolio review, in addition to other leading portfolio management tools.

Philosophy



Capital Appreciation Portfolio


The portfolio's primary objective is long term growth of capital. We achieve this by owning successful franchises that are purchased below their underlying value. The companies comprising the Capital Appreciation Portfolio have strong positions in their respective industries.


Read More

Balanced Portfolio




The portfolio's primary goal is risk-adjusted growth of capital combined with dividend and/or interest income. The purchase of short to intermediate term taxable or tax exempt bonds will augment the equity dividends in the portfolio. 


Read More

Income Oriented Portfolio


In 2010, M&R incorporated the income orientated portfolio within their asset management strategy. The primary objective is high current and growing income, coupled with modest capital appreciation and capital preservation. The high dividend yield allows for preservation of capital during periods of market volatility.

Investment Philosophy:
 M&R Capital is a large cap value and multi‐cap value investment firm. Through proprietary research, we identify securities that are trading at discounts to their underlying values. Therefore, as value investors, our investment strategy is long term in its approach. We expect to hold securities for several years and do so in companies that have strong fundamentals accompanied with a proven history of success within their industry. 
M&R offers three (3) core investment strategies: 
1.Capital Appreciation Portfolio
2.Balanced Portfolio
3.Income Orientated Portfolio 


GLOBAL ASSET ALLOCATION: M&R utilizes a multi‐cap asset allocation strategy. Both domestic and international equities, American Depository Receipts (ADR’s), and Exchange‐Traded Funds (ETF’s) are incorporated within the international segment of the portfolio as a cost‐effective means of international diversification and ETF’s are used to achieve the small and mid cap equity exposure.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space.

Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does M&R Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
M&R Inc currently holds license 702127, 1003382 (General Building Contractor, Manufactured Housing), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring M&R Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring M&R Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
M&R Inc has a $12,500 bond with Wesco Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring M&R Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

for any job, commercial or residential.

BuildZoom = Happy Customers




I used BuildZoom to add solar panels to my house. BuildZoom matched me with two highly rated, experienced
pros. I took the lower bid, and have been extremely happy with the result. I plan to use them for all
future projects.


I used BuildZoom to remodel my bathroom and kitchen, and it was the best contractor experience I've ever
had. They not only find great contractors, but they add an extra layer of accountability that goes a long way.


As a custom home builder who takes pride in his work, I love being on this site. It allows me to more
easily build a trust relationship with potential customers, because they can easily see my work history.

Professional Account Management


On An Individual Basis


M&R Capital Management is a wealth management firm serving individuals, family offices as well as endowments 
			and other institutions. Our investment professionals have decades of investment experience providing advice and 
			helping implement innovative investment strategies.


















Company History
Our firm was founded in 1993 by John Maloney and Richard Diver. The firm has grown over the years and has adapted to the changing opportunities in the wealth management business. We have increased the number of products we offer our clients and value our role as a large and mid-size capitalization investor. 

Vision
We pride ourselves with our abilities in working closely with our clients as we identify and implement their investment objectives. As our firm continues to grow, we will build upon our core principles that help our clients attain their objectives.

 Philosophy
We identify opportunities in publicly traded securities that are trading at a discount to our estimate of their underlying value. Over time, equities offer greater appreciation potential than other investments.
