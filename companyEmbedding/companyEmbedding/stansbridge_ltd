Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

                            About us 



                            Here at Stanbridge Limited we have been going since the 1950s, where we have been supplying necessary infection control and decontamination equipment. We also like to specialise in equipment for sluice rooms.

We have been working on designs for washer and disinfector machines for many years, leading the way in efficiency. Along with this, we have teamed up with many reputable associations over the years, where we played an important role in infection control across a variety of environments such as care and nursing homes and hospitals, as well as processes like assisted bathing.

Our impressive range begins with providing greater ease into the lives of patients, the elderly, the disabled, nurses, carers and whoever else concerned. Our swing reclining bath systems turns assisted bathing into less of a chore.

Hospitals and nursing homes require a lot of consideration and commitment over hygiene, but would rather do this through the most efficient way. This is where our equipment can help. Bedpans can be easily maintained with our bedpan washers and disinfectors. Additionally, we supply a variety of bedpans, commodes and urine bottles; hand hygiene can be maintained from our range of wash basins and our janitorial deep clean sinks; various sluices and stainless steel slop hoppers are available; thorough cleaning can be applied with our scrub troughs; storage solutions can be met with our range of cupboards, shelving and racks, etc.

Along with these products, it’s essential to provide helpful service. Our service covers installation, technical and assistance support, callout support for breakdowns comprising of our team of highly skilled engineers, servicing for products and tailored service agreements.

We aim to adhere to compliance through the guidelines put in place by CQC and HPA and by this you can trust our service and reliability, as well as the quality of our products.
