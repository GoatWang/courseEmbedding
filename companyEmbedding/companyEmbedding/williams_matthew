Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.

We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

About the Sessions▼▲
Session 1: From Warrior to Servant: Jesus the Messiah

Explore Caesarea Philippi, the location of the Gates of Hades, where Jesus and his disciples stood. Dive into greater depths of who Jesus really is: the Son of God, the Christ, and the Messiah. Dr. Matt Williams teaches about the shocking revelation of Jesus' identity to his disciples: not a military conqueror overthrowing Rome, but a suffering servant triumphing over evil and death. What is it to deny yourself? What did Jesus mean when he told Peter, "Get behind me, Satan?" Unpack the incredible mysteries & prophecies in Matthew 16 using the Old Testament Scriptures and Jewish cultural context.

Session 2: A Glimpse of Glory: The Transfiguration

Get a glimpse of Nazareth, Jesus' hometown as you dive into the story of the Transfiguration. From the Colorado Rockies, Dr. Susan Hecht guides you through this historic and pivotal teaching of the Transfiguration in Matthew 17, where the Old and New Testament collide. Get an in-depth overview of Jesus' meeting with Elijah and Moses, what his transfiguration means for our transformation, the disciples' reactions, and how to apply this lesson to our lives.

Session 3: The Rejected King: The Triumphal Entry

Travel along the Mount of Olives where Jesus frequently traveled and where he entered Jerusalem on a donkey to publicly proclaim his identity as the Messiah. Dr. Mark Strauss walks you through the three events that make up the Triumphal Entry: Jesus' entrance on Palm Sunday, the cleansing of the temple, and the cursing of the fig tree. Dr. Strauss covers the historical and cultural background of Passover, Old Testament prophecies, Jewish customs of temple sacrifice, and much more! Plus, get practical applications to bring the Lord of Lords into your day-to-day living and transform the world around you!

 
Session 4: Love to the Full: The Last Supper

Experience Upper Mount Zion, where Jesus and his disciples spent their final night together for the Last Supper. Dr. Scott Duvall covers the Passover ceremony in-depth to shine light on the meaning of the events of this critical evening, including Jesus washing his disciples' feet, the betrayal of Judas, the Lord's Supper, and much more. Learn to apply the 3 practical principles Jesus displays in this lesson: selfless love, serving one another, and forgiveness!

Session 5: The Ultimate Victory: The Trial and Death of Jesus

Discover the Garden of Gethsemane, filled with olive trees thousands of years old, where Jesus came to hide and was arrested by the Romans after being betrayed by Judas. Join Dr. Darrell Bock in Dallas, Texas, as he walks through the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. What was the claim Jesus made that pressed Pilate to convict him? Dr. Bock puts Jesus' confession, his death, and the reaction of the public in Jewish, Roman, and modern day contexts to paint a powerful picture of God's plan for salvation.

Session 6: The Death of Death: The Resurrection of Jesus

Take a walk by the Garden Tomb, one of the few likely places where Jesus rose from the dead to proclaim his triumph over evil. Discover the earth-shattering power of the resurrection of Jesus Dr. Gary Burge at Forest Home Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois, as he vividly reconstructs the scene using the Scriptures, apologetics, and first century Jewish culture. Enrich your understanding of the most spectacular event in all of Christian history and learn how to allow it to transform you from the inside out.

            As I stated in a couple of my previous reviews of other items, I am going to be in Israel in a very short time for a 10-day  tour.  So far, I have loved the Deeper Connections Series DVD-based Bible Studies as they have parts that are filmed on location in Israel.  To see the site locations that pertain to the miracles and where Jesus walked helped dramatically to put Scripture into perspective.  The teaching in the 6 different Bible studies are solid on the last days of Jesus and how we can apply the lessons we learn to our lives is excellent to say the least.  From a content perspective, this is put together very well.   You won't go wrong with purchasing this excellent Bible study kit.


DVD VIDEO (ISBN: 978-1628624328)


As I mentioned previously in this review, it is based all on the digital content and not the physical content.  So, I received electronic video files from Rose Publishing to watch each of the sessions included in the DVD that comes with the kit.  The videos range from around 26 to 36 minutes in length.


The videos are very professionally done and each session has separate sections to them.  Initially, the lesson starts out with an amazing introduction with Margaret Feinberg that is filmed on location in Israel which helps connect the Scriptures on such a personal level.  She really did an excellent job.  I honestly love the approach of doing these videos on-site in Israel for two reasons.  First because I will be taking a trip with my wife and her mother in a little over a week for a 10-day trip to Israel.  I enjoy seeing some of the sites ahead of time. Second, and more importantly, seeing some of the sites where these events took place many years ago really helps us to put Scripture into perspective so we can understand it better and apply it more accurately to our lives.  After the introduction, the video teachings start off with an audio reading of the pertinent Scriptures (from the NIV Audio Bible) and then the lesson from the teacher, and finally, a quick video graphic called "Connecting the Bible to Life" where they direct you to the discussion section within the Participant's Guide where we review how to apply what we've learned.  Some of the videos are broken up during the teaching portion to have discussions throughout the teaching time.


LEADER GUIDE (digital copy included with the DVD)


The kit comes with a digital copy of the Leader Guide that you can print out.  It is 33 pages, so it was not a huge burden on my printer..  My review is based on the digital copy that I received from Rose Publishing. Each of the six sessions has very helpful ideas for group leaders on how to prepare, setup and conduct the Bible study meetings, Tips for preparation for before the meeting, how to open the session, and so much more.  Clear instructions are vital in my opinion and Rose did a very nice job accomplishing just that. The leader/facilitator should have no issues running a Bible study using these materials and this leader guide.


I received a copy of this digital material from Rose Publishing in exchange for my honest review.

            "The Last Days of Jesus" is a 6-session DVD Bible study for small groups or personal use. Each session is 25-35 minutes long. It starts with 2-3 minutes of video on location in Israel (Ceasarea Philippi, Mount of Olives, Garden Tomb, etc.) with Margaret Feinberg. This is followed by audio of the study text from Matthew using the NIV Audio Bible. Then a New Testament scholar provides 17 minutes of commentary on the passage and 6-10 minutes of application. They walk you through the text while explaining first century context and cultural background information.


For example, Session 1 covers "Who do people say that I am?" and explained why people thought Jesus might be those people and what they expected of the Messiah. Dr. Williams also explained some phrases like "keys of the kingdom of heaven" and underlying word plays. Each session features a different speaker, so Session 1 on Matthew 16:13-28 features Dr. Matt Williams, Session 3 on Matthew 21:1-22 features Dr. Mark Strauss, and Session 6 on Matthew 28:1-10 features Dr. Gary Burge.


The lessons are on Jesus the Messiah, the Transfiguration, the Triumphal Entry, the Last Supper, The Trial and Death of Jesus, and Jesus' Resurrection. Overall, I thought that the three sessions I viewed were informative and interesting. I'd recommend this series as a small group Bible study.


My review is based off of a free viewing of 3 video sessions as provided by the publisher.

            This is an articulate and in-depth Bible study that brings Scripture to life. The imagery displayed in the videos and the audible reading of Scripture enables the listener to place themselves in the scenario. Also, the presentation of differing interpretations encourages interaction with the application of Truth to the life of the Church. I greatly appreciate the explanation of the cultural and historical context to denote the tension between the Messiah of Jewish expectation and the suffering Messiah; it debunks false understandings of who Jesus is. Whether you've grown up in Church or are new believer, I definitely recommend this study. For those with an intellectual appetite, the use of Greek words creates a greater desire to be immersed in study of the text. For those who love the simplicity of the Gospel, you cannot help but be in awe of the love communicated in the last days of Jesus. For all Christians, a genuine intrigue in the Word of God in both the Old and New Testament.

            The last days of Jesus leading up to his death are powerful. Jesus is serving and teaching right up until he becomes the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. Recognizing the full meaning and implications of these last days can be difficult on your own, but a study like this one helps these rich narratives come to life in new ways. It is amazing to be able to hear about the meaning of these accounts of Jesus' last days from scholars who have studied these texts closely so that they can be faithful teachers. This DVD series would be so helpful for personal use as you seek to gain a further understanding of what is happening in the last days of Christ or for use with a church small group. The teaching of these scholars coupled with stirring scenes filmed in Israel makes for a great DVD study of the last days of Christ.

            This is an articulate and in-depth Bible study that brings Scripture to life. The imagery displayed in the videos and the audible reading of Scripture enables the listener to place themselves in the scenario. Also, the presentation of differing interpretations encourages interaction with the application of Truth to the life of the Church. I greatly appreciate the explanation of the cultural and historical context to denote the tension between the Messiah of Jewish expectation and the suffering Messiah; it debunks false understandings of who Jesus is. Whether you've grown up in Church or are new believer, I definitely recommend this study. For those with an intellectual appetite, the use of Greek words creates a greater desire to be immersed in study of the text. For those who love the simplicity of the Gospel, you cannot help but be in awe of the love communicated in the last days of Jesus. For all Christians, a genuine intrigue in the Word of God in both the Old and New Testament.

            This participant guide is a helpful tool to go along with the DVD series. The series itself is a great aid for recognizing the full meaning and implications of the last days of Christ. Led by Dr. Williams, a team of scholars provides background information and details that help the viewer recognize the importance and impact of these narratives. This DVD series would be so helpful for personal use as you seek to gain a further understanding of what is happening in the last days of Christ or for use with a church small group. The teaching of these scholars coupled with stirring scenes filmed in Israel makes for a powerful DVD study of the last days of Christ.

            This series contains excellent Bible teachers who take deep Biblical truths and present them in very accessible ways. From always beginning with an introduction in Israel itself, to then explaining the background context for each passage, you get an awesome backdrop for the teachings that follow. This is good scholarship and professionally presented so that it is not boring or cheesy. Listeners quickly will see the Messianic identity and significance of Jesus, and how they are to respond.

            From the intellectual insights to the intimate "Jesus moments" coupled with life-changing reflections, this series has many layers of excellence! As a pastor of 20 years, I used this with our small groups and we came away profoundly impacted and deeply impressed. The video production on these is also very well done and worth noting.

Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry
Edited by James Williams and Matthew Bevis


The first collection of exploratory essays on Edward Lear
Places Lear's work into a wide range of contexts, both among his contemporaries and in a longer perspective
Seek to explore and appreciate the playfulness embodied in the poems and to provide contexts in which it can be better understood and enjoyed








Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry
Edited by James Williams and Matthew Bevis



Description



Of all the Victorian poets, Edward Lear has a good claim to the widest audience: admired and championed by critics and poets from John Ruskin to John Ashbery, he has also been read, heard, and loved by generations of children. As a central figure in the literature of nonsense, Lear has also shaped the evolution of modern literature and his work continues to influence and inspire writers and readers today. This collection of essays, the first ever devoted solely to Lear, builds on a recent resurgence of critical interest and asks how it is that the play of Lear's poetry continues to delight, and to challenge our sense of what poetry can be. These seventeen chapters, written by established and emerging critics of poetry, seek to explore and appreciate the playfulness embodied in the poems and to provide contexts in which it can be better understood and enjoyed. They consider how Lear's poems play off various inheritances (the literary fool, Romantic lyric, his religious upbringing), explore particular forms in which his playful genius took flight (his letters, his queer writings about love), and trace lines of Learical influence and inheritance by showing how other poets and thinkers across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries played off Lear in their turn (Stein, Eliot, Auden, Smith, Ashbery, and others).

Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry
Edited by James Williams and Matthew Bevis


Reviews and Awards


"[An] excellent volume ... If Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry is any guide to what is to come, the future for Lear studies looks bright indeed. Its contributors show it to be possible to write successfully about his nonsense in diverse ways. ... Arriving at a moment when Lear's critical fortunes appear to be on the rise, it will be an essential point of reference." --Martin Dubois, Review of English Studies
"An admirable new collection...Rarely does a collection of essays published by an academic press carry such emotional nuance, or tune it to the requirements of literary analysis so deftly and consistently...This collection will swiftly become one of the first ports of call for Lear scholars, but some of its essays deserve to be read by anyone with an interest in the ways we might "turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us," as Matthew Arnold put it." --Times Literary Supplement
"Almost every page contained pleasurable surprises." --Paris Review
