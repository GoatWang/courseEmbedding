e-Gel vs.Clif SHOT Bloks
	  Clif SHOT Bloks and other "chew" products are loaded with sugar and fat, 
		just like candy. Clif SHOT Bloks may taste good, but if your goal is to 
		improve performance, we're not sure why would anyone would want to use 
		these during your training or competition.

Maltodextrin 
			(a complex carbohydrate from corn) is the preferred carbohydrate source for endurance athletes and
    as such it is the primary ingredient in e-Gel as well as most other good
    products on the market. e-Gel contains twice as much complex carbohydrates 
			compared to SHOT Bloks and less than half the simple sugars. Clif SHOT Bloks on the other hand use evaporated
    cane juice and brown rice syrup. Both of these sound good on the label,
    unfortunately,  evaporated cane
    juice is another name for sugar and brown rice syrup is also very high 
			in sugar. The danger of high 
			sugar content products is that they can elevate your blood sugar 
			level too far too fast which can lead to a sugar crash (also known 
			as bonking). read more

e-Gel is the ONLY energy gel that is designed to provide complete and

    designed to meet the American College of Sports Medicine's recommendation
    for electrolyte replacement during intense athletic activity.

			While caffeine may give a temporary mental boost, unfortunately it 
			is a diuretic, meaning that it causes your kidneys to produce more 
			urine - thus promoting dehydration. Proper hydration is critical to 
			optimum performance, and in our opinion caffeine should not be 
			incorporated into your sports nutrition program. Our recommendation 
			has always been that if you feel that you NEED caffeine, then only 
			use a caffeinated product (there are plenty on the market) near the 
			end of your competition when you need the psychological boost the 
			most and there is little time to cause dehydration. We strongly 
			recommend against relying on a caffeinated product for the duration 
			of the competition. None of e-Gel's flavors contain caffeine. Some 
			GU flavors have caffeine, for current flavors and ingredients refer 
			to their website.

                        "The Los Angeles Marathon was a death march! The temperature at the start was in the lower 80s and climbed to 90 by the time I finished the race. Many people suffered from heat cramps and vomiting, and had to be pulled off the course. But I did NOT suffer from any of those problems, which was probably due to the high sodium content of the e-Gels I ate during the race; I ate 5 of them!" (read

e-Gel
		vs.
		EFS Liquid Shot Gel
First Endurance EFS Liquid Shot Gel is fairly new to the market and is 
		improvement in some areas over many traditional gels, but it still comes 
		up far short of e-Gel in terms of electrolyte levels and carbohydrate 
		sources.

EFS Liquid Shot does not come in individual packets, so for the 
		purposes of this comparison to e-Gel we have used 150 calories of each 
		product. The first thing that jumps out is that EFS Liquid Shot contains
		50% simple sugars, that's the highest level of all energy gels on 
		the market that we are aware of (you should be looking for low levels of 
		simple sugars and high levels of complex carbohydrates). As for 
		electrolytes, e-Gel contains 50% more sodium, the most important 
		electrolyte for maintaining hydration and avoiding cramping. Amazingly, 
		even when purchasing EFS Liquid Shot is the 2,400 calorie bulk jug, the 
		cost per serving is 18% more than e-Gel.

e-Gel
		vs.
Sport Beans 
Sport Beans are a 
		seemingly attractive alternative to energy gels 
		primarily because people enjoy eating - especially when it's candy! 
		However, if your goal is improving your athletic performance we would 
		strongly advise you to take a long hard look at what's in those Sport 
		Beans.

Highlights:
  Sport Beans are 68% simple sugars vs. 18% for e-Gel
      - related reading >>
		why is low sugar important?

  Sport Beans have very few electrolytes
      -  critical to maintain hydration and avoid 
		cramping and injuries

  Sport Beans have Carnuba Wax and Beeswax

Carbohydrates
    Maltodextrin is the preferred carbohydrate source for endurance athletes and
    as such it is the primary ingredient in e-Gel as well as most other good
    products on the market. Sport Beans on the other hand uses evaporated cane 
	juice (aka sugar) and Tapioca Syrup which results in a carbohydrate blend that is 68% 
	simple sugar (compared to e-Gel which is only 18%)  The danger of high sugar content products
    such as Honey Stinger Waffles is that they
    can elevate your blood sugar level too far too fast which can lead to a
    sugar crash (also known as bonking). Higher sugar content also raises the osmolality of the product which can reduce energy delivery, delay fluid
    absorption and promote dehydration.  




  
    




Fat
    Fat has to go through a digestive process which requires blood flow AWAY 
	from your muscles and back to the stomach. Endurance athletes want maximum 
	blood flow to the working muscles for the oxygenation process (less oxygen = 
	decreased performance). Sport Beans are formulated with Carnuba Wax and 
	Beeswax.



  
    




Electrolytes
    e-Gel is the ONLY energy gel that is designed to provide complete and 
	balanced electrolyte replacement that is critical for proper hydration and 
	to avoid muscle cramping. e-Gel has approximately 3 times the amount of selectrolytes compared to 
	Sport Beans. The sodium and potassium levels in e-Gel are
    designed to meet the American College of Sports Medicine's recommendation
    for electrolyte replacement during intense athletic activity.

COLLEGE PARK, Md., July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- gel-e Inc., a privately-held, clinical-stage medical device company, today announces that it has raised $3.1 million in a private financing, led by early-stage investment funds and life science investors. 








The financing allows gel-e to expand its initial U.S. FDA regulatory clearance for the management of bleeding wounds, including vascular access sites (Vascular gel-e®) to a broader hemostatic product line for the treatment of external wounds. In parallel, this funding allows the company to establish cGMP manufacturing of gel-e's active ingredient.  If you'd like to learn more visit http://www.gel-e.co.
"gel-e exemplifies an ideal investment for us," said Jim Hughes, Director, UM Ventures.  "By strategically deploying grants, gel-e has built an impressive corporate foundation, such as achieving its first regulatory clearance, securing an issued patent estate, and recognition through numerous peer-reviewed publications. We are excited to be a part of this financing that supports the next phase in the company's growth."          
gel-e's mission is to develop a broad range of game-changing hemostatic and wound treatment products, including bandages for the treatment of routine cuts and scrapes, foams and putties for traumatic and military injuries, and surgical gels and powders. The path created by Vascular gel-e® facilitates expansion of the company's portfolio, while gaining greater confidence about the platform's safety and efficacy for future indications, including internal surgical use.  
Prior to this financing, gel-e was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (through the SBIR), the United States Army Research Lab, Maryland Industrial Partnerships, and the Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO).
"I've had the chance to apply the technology in a few research studies," said Dr. Mayur Narayan, attending trauma surgeon and Associate Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College/ New York Presbyterian Hospital.  "These studies involved lethal bleeding in large animal models, where we were able to achieve rapid hemostasis using gel-e hemostats with superior results to competitive products."
About the Company gel-e is developing a novel line of hemostatic and wound treatment products.  With an initial focus on external wounds, gel-e combines the use of safe, inert ingredients with proprietary chemistry that can be designed for use across a broad spectrum of clinical applications including vascular closure and during surgery. gel-e is based in College Park, Md.

e-Gel Electrolyte Energy Gele-Gel has half the sugars of GU and other leading energy 
				gels and it's the only Electrolyte Energy Gel with 4 
	times the sodium and double the potassium. When taken with water you can now get
      balanced hydration, energy and
                electrolyte replacement in one product. And, with 150
                carbohydrate calories, e-Gel packs 50% more energy than most competing energy gels. 
	With e-Gel you get more energy, no sugar BONKS and complete electrolyte 
	replacement to avoid cramping and injuries!

	The Balanced
      Solution
              Energy Gels by themselves are extremely hypertonic (more concentrated then
      your body fluids), which means that you have to consume water to ensure 
	that they are rapidly absorbed. This is the case for all gels (GU,
		Clif Shot and
		others). Water dilutes the
      gel and lowers the concentration (osmolality), thus increasing the
      absorption rate. If you consume just the right amount of water, the combined solution will become isotonic (the same
      concentration as your body fluids) which allows for rapid absorption,
      hydration and maximum energy delivery.

              If you try to get your electrolytes by drinking a sports drink (instead of water)
      it will not properly dilute the gel, thus slowing the absorption rate. This
      can also lead to stomach irritation and a dehydrating effect as your
      cellular fluids are drawn upon to dilute the gel. (read more:
		when to use energy gels vs. 
		hydration drinks and can they be used together)

	So, if you drink water with your
      gel like you have to, then how do you replace your electrolytes? Other gels contain
      electrolytes, but they do not contain nearly enough (see
              comparisons) to
      provide adequate electrolyte replacement (even
      GU says so). e-Gel on the other hand is the first Electrolyte Energy Gel and is
              designed to provide complete and
      balanced energy, hydration and electrolyte replacement. In fact, e-Gel has more
      than 5 times the sodium and twice as much potassium as competing gels. 
    




e-Gel is low in sugar, why is his important?
	If we spike the 
	level of our blood sugar then we have lots of energy ... for a little while, 
	and then we come crashing down. This doesn't work so well for "endurance" 
	athletes. Simple sugars can do just that, a little bit is okay but too much 
	will quickly raise your blood sugar. If it could stay elevated life would be 
	great, but unfortunately it can't, and when and comes back down it drops 
	(crashes) well below where it started. When this happens during athletic 
	activity it is a dual edged sword. Your performance will drop as the blood 
	sugar drops because your body is depending on that energy, and your body 
	will no longer be able to as efficiently convert your muscle glycogen into 
	usable energy ... here comes the BONK!!! The goal is to maintain a 
	consistent blood sugar level without the spikes and crashes, and this is 
	achieved by relying primarily on complex carbohydrates and low sugar levels, 
	and that's exactly what you get with e-Gel!

Ingredients

The primary 
	ingredient in e-Gel is maltodextrin, a complex carbohydrate derived from 
	corn. For endurance activities you should always look for products that are 
	high in complex carbohydrates and low in simple sugars. The problem with 
	simple sugars is that they rapidly increase your blood sugar, which feels 
	good for a short period of time, but then your blood sugar can come crashing 
	down. When you give your kids candy this is called a sugar crash but when it 
	happens to an athlete we call it BONKing. The carbohydrate blend in e-Gel is 
	82% maltodextrin and 18% fructose and has been formulated to maximize energy 
	delivery. Research has shown that products with multiple carbohydrate 
	sources can deliver more energy to working muscles compared to products 
	using a single carbohydrate source. It is also important to note that there 
	is a wide variety of maltodextrins with varying molecular structures. e-Gel 
	uses the highest quality maltodextrin with a large molecular structure that 
	allows the product to deliver even more energy (for more information read 
	about the 
	effect of carbohydrates on osmolality). Be aware of products that use 
	large amounts of carbohydrates that are high in simple sugars such as 
	sucrose, honey, brown rice syrup, evaporated cane juice, etc.). e-Gel is 
	also 100% Gluten-Free.

Complete List of Ingredients


	Product Usage
For each hour of athletic activity,
    Crank Sports recommends
      consuming 1 to 2 e-Gel packets and 16 to 32 ounces of water for balanced
      energy, hydration and electrolyte replacement. Your individual intake
      requirements will vary depend among other things on temperature, humidity,
      athletic intensity, etc. For more information, refer to: Hydration
    - the key to optimum performance with energy gels.


Why Try e-Gel?
      There is very little difference 
	between most traditional energy gels besides taste, texture and packaging. e-Gel is not just another
    energy gel, it is the only Electrolyte Energy Gel and it truly stands apart 
	from the competition. e-Gel is the only gel that provides balanced 
	electrolyte replacement, the highest quality carbohydrates and a complete 
	profile of amino acids and antioxidants. For more information, see why
    try e-Gel?

overviewcompetitionvideoflavorsnutritionpricing














e-Gel vs.GLUKOS Energy Gel
		The comparison between e-Gel and 
		GLUKOS Energy Gel is striking. e-Gel is the
      most complete energy gel on the market today while GLUKOS has the highest sugar levels 
		(100%), very low electrolyte levels, no amino acids
      or antioxidants and three times the price.

Maltodextrin is the preferred carbohydrate source for endurance athletes and
    as such it is the primary ingredient in e-Gel as well as most other good
    products on the market. GLUKOS Energy Gel on the other hand uses glucose 
	(more commonly known as dextrose in food items) which is 
	100% 
	simple sugar (compared to e-Gel which is only 18%)  The danger of high sugar content products
    such as GLUKOS is that they
    can elevate your blood sugar level too far too fast which can lead to a
    sugar crash (also known as bonking). Higher sugar content also raises the osmolality of the product which can reduce energy delivery, delay fluid
    absorption and promote dehydration. GLUKOS claims that since glucose 
	(dextrose) is rapidly absorbed that this is a benefit, but to the contrary, 
	an endurance athlete actually needs to avoid the type of blood sugar 
	fluctuations that simple sugars can cause. For more information

			While caffeine may give a temporary mental boost, unfortunately it 
			is a diuretic, meaning that it causes your kidneys to produce more 
			urine - thus promoting dehydration. Proper hydration is critical to 
			optimum performance, and in our opinion caffeine should not be 
			incorporated into your sports nutrition program. Our recommendation 
			has always been that if you feel that you NEED caffeine, then only 
			use a caffeinated product (there are plenty on the market) near the 
			end of your competition when you need the psychological boost the 
			most and there is little time to cause dehydration. We strongly 
			recommend against relying on a caffeinated product for the duration 
			of the competition. None of e-Gel's flavors contain caffeine.

With a retail price of $1.59 per pack,

    that each pack of e-Gel contains 150 calories vs. only 60 calories in a pack of 
			GLUKOS, GLUKOS is more than tripple the price!

                        "I was running my best marathon ever in Detroit.  I had five miles to go and I took my Tropical Blast e-Gel because there was a water station about 100 yards ahead.  I got to the station and it was a bunch of guys handing out beer!  Determined, I went on.  The e-Gel was so easy to digest, I got through it just fine when I hit a water station about a mile later.  Somehow that just cranked me and my fastest mile was mile 26.  Not only did I finally hit my sub-three hour dream, I hit 2:57!" (read

Carbohydrates
    Maltodextrin is the preferred carbohydrate source for endurance athletes and
    as such it is the primary ingredient in e-Gel as well as most other good
    products on the market. Huma Gel on the other hand uses evaporated cane 
	juice (sugar) and brown rice syrup which combined is 80% 
	simple sugar (compared to e-Gel which is only 18%)  The danger of high sugar content products
    such as Huma Gel is that they
    can elevate your blood sugar level too far too fast which can lead to a
    sugar crash (also known as bonking). Higher sugar content also raises the osmolality of the product which can reduce energy delivery, delay fluid
    absorption and promote dehydration.  




  
    




Electrolytes
    e-Gel is the ONLY energy gel that is designed to provide complete and 
	balanced electrolyte replacement that is critical for proper hydration and 
	to avoid muscle cramping. e-Gel more than double the amount of sodium compared to 
	Huma 
	Gel. IN addition, Huma Gel has NO potassium. The sodium and potassium levels in e-Gel are
    designed to meet the American College of Sports Medicine's recommendation
    for electrolyte replacement during intense athletic activity.





  
    




Amino Acids
    The amino acids in e-Gel are designed to reduce lactic acid build up, 
	maintain muscle protein and aid in recovery. Huma Gel and most
    other energy products on
    the market today fail to include amino acids because they are expensive
    ingredients. 




  
    




Citrates
    Citrates assist in the carbohydrate to energy conversion process as well as
    reduce and slow the build-up of lactic acid in your muscles.





  
    




Antioxidants
    e-Gel is one of the few energy gels that contains antioxidant vitamins C and E
    to help protect against tissue damage,
    reduce soreness and aid in the recovery process.





  
    




Vitamin B6
    Vitamin B6 assists in the
    energy conversion process and e-Gel is one of the only energy gels to 
	include this ingredient.



     



Protein



Protein has to go through a 
	digestive process which draws blood away from working muscles to the stomach 
	and intestines. When you are competing in an aerobic activity you want as 
	much blood as possible supplied to your muscles carrying fresh oxygen for 
	the energy conversion process. Here are links to the research that show that 
	protein in your energy gel DOES NOT boost performance:

Fat



Fat has to go through a digestive 
	process which draws blood away from working muscles to the stomach and 
	intestines. When you are competing in an aerobic activity you want as much 
	blood as possible supplied to your muscles carrying fresh oxygen for the 
	energy conversion process. You should avoid fats, fibers and proteins 
	endurance athletic activity and stick with fast absorbing liquid 
	carbohydrates.

gel-e Secures $3.1 Million Financing for Innovative Hemostatic and Advanced Wound Treatment Platform






Jul 13, 2017, 10:08am EDT














COLLEGE PARK, Md., July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- gel-e Inc., a privately-held, clinical-stage medical device company, today announces that it has raised $3.1 million in a private financing, led by early-stage investment funds and life science investors. 



The financing allows gel-e to expand its initial U.S. FDA regulatory clearance for the management of bleeding wounds, including vascular access sites (Vascular gel-e®) to a broader hemostatic product line for the treatment of external wounds. In parallel, this funding allows the company to establish cGMP manufacturing of gel-e's active ingredient.  If you'd like to learn more visit http://www.gel-e.co.
"gel-e exemplifies an ideal investment for us," said Jim Hughes, Director, UM Ventures.  "By strategically deploying grants, gel-e has built an impressive corporate foundation, such as achieving its first regulatory clearance, securing an issued patent estate, and recognition through numerous peer-reviewed publications. We are excited to be a part of this financing that supports the next phase in the company's growth."          
gel-e's mission is to develop a broad range of game-changing hemostatic and wound treatment products, including bandages for the treatment of routine cuts and scrapes, foams and putties for traumatic and military injuries, and surgical gels and powders. The path created by Vascular gel-e® facilitates expansion of the company's portfolio, while gaining greater confidence about the platform's safety and efficacy for future indications, including internal surgical use.  
Prior to this financing, gel-e was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (through the SBIR), the United States Army Research Lab, Maryland Industrial Partnerships, and the Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO).
"I've had the chance to apply the technology in a few research studies," said Dr. Mayur Narayan, attending trauma surgeon and Associate Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College/ New York Presbyterian Hospital.  "These studies involved lethal bleeding in large animal models, where we were able to achieve rapid hemostasis using gel-e hemostats with superior results to competitive products."
About the Company gel-e is developing a novel line of hemostatic and wound treatment products.  With an initial focus on external wounds, gel-e combines the use of safe, inert ingredients with proprietary chemistry that can be designed for use across a broad spectrum of clinical applications including vascular closure and during surgery. gel-e is based in College Park, Md.

It is comprised of synthetic aminoethylamide, and is commonly used as a numbing agent, working by inhibiting sodium channel ion flux, thus blocking nerve impulses.PrilocainePrilocaine is a short acting topical local anesthetic, chemically designated as an amide, which provides dermal analgesia. Onset time after administration is slightly longer than lidocaine, but duration of action is also longer.TetracaineTetracaine is a longer acting local anesthetic that works by affecting calcium channel function. Tetracaine may take up to 15 minutes before onset of action, but the duration is also longer than either lidocaine or prilocaine (typically 2-3 hours).PhenylephrinePhenylephrine is a phenethylamine primarily used as a decongestant, vasopressor, and vascular constrictor. More Dentistry Products

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

COLLEGE PARK, Md., July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- gel-e Inc., a privately-held, clinical-stage medical device company, today announces that it has raised $3.1 million in a private financing, led by early-stage investment funds and life science investors. The financing allows gel-e to expand its initial U.S. FDA regulatory clearance for the management of bleeding wounds, including vascular access sites (Vascular gel-e®) to a broader hemostatic product line for the treatment of external wounds. In parallel, this funding allows the company to establish cGMP manufacturing of gel-e's active ingredient.  If you'd like to learn more visit http://www.gel-e.co."gel-e exemplifies an ideal investment for us," said Jim Hughes, Director, UM Ventures.  "By strategically deploying grants, gel-e has built an impressive corporate foundation, such as achieving its first regulatory clearance, securing an issued patent estate, and recognition through numerous peer-reviewed publications. We are excited to be a part of this financing that supports the next phase in the company's growth."          gel-e's mission is to develop a broad range of game-changing hemostatic and wound treatment products, including bandages for the treatment of routine cuts and scrapes, foams and putties for traumatic and military injuries, and surgical gels and powders. The path created by Vascular gel-e® facilitates expansion of the company's portfolio, while gaining greater confidence about the platform's safety and efficacy for future indications, including internal surgical use.  Prior to this financing, gel-e was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (through the SBIR), the United States Army Research Lab, Maryland Industrial Partnerships, and the Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO)."I've had the chance to apply the technology in a few research studies," said Dr. Mayur Narayan, attending trauma surgeon and Associate Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College/ New York Presbyterian Hospital.  "These studies involved lethal bleeding in large animal models, where we were able to achieve rapid hemostasis using gel-e hemostats with superior results to competitive products."About the Company gel-e is developing a novel line of hemostatic and wound treatment products.  With an initial focus on external wounds, gel-e combines the use of safe, inert ingredients with proprietary chemistry that can be designed for use across a broad spectrum of clinical applications including vascular closure and during surgery. gel-e is based in College Park, Md.For additional information, please visit http://www.gel-e.co.  Contacts: Larry Tiffany, gel-e, Inc.(301) 529-4943  pr@gel-e.co View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gel-e-secures-31-million-financing-for-innovative-hemostatic-and-advanced-wound-treatment-platform-300487289.htmlSOURCE  gel-e, Inc.

July 13, 2017 - gel-e Secures $3.1 Million Financing
gel-e Inc., announces that it has raised $3.1 million in a private financing, led by early-stage investment funds and life science investors.
The financing allows gel-e to expand its initial U.S. FDA regulatory clearance for the management of bleeding wounds, including vascular access sites (Vascular gel-eÂŽ) to a broader hemostatic product line for the treatment of external wounds. In parallel, this funding allows the company to establish cGMP manufacturing of gel-e's active ingredient.  If you'd like to learn more visit http://www.gel-e.co.
"gel-e exemplifies an ideal investment for us," said Jim Hughes, Director, UM Ventures.  "By strategically deploying grants, gel-e has built an impressive corporate foundation, such as achieving its first regulatory clearance, securing an issued patent estate, and recognition through numerous peer-reviewed publications. We are excited to be a part of this financing that supports the next phase in the company's growth."
gel-e's mission is to develop a broad range of game-changing hemostatic and wound treatment products, including bandages for the treatment of routine cuts and scrapes, foams and putties for traumatic and military injuries, and surgical gels and powders. The path created by Vascular gel-eÂŽ facilitates expansion of the company's portfolio, while gaining greater confidence about the platform's safety and efficacy for future indications, including internal surgical use.
Prior to this financing, gel-e was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (through the SBIR), the United States Army Research Lab, Maryland Industrial Partnerships, and the Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO).
"I've had the chance to apply the technology in a few research studies," said Dr. Mayur Narayan, attending trauma surgeon and Associate Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College/ New York Presbyterian Hospital.  "These studies involved lethal bleeding in large animal models, where we were able to achieve rapid hemostasis using gel-e hemostats with superior results to competitive products."


February 1, 2017 - New Notice of Trademark Allowance
The USPTO issued a notice of trademark allowance on the name "gel-e," which is at the core of our branding. This allowance continues the build of our intellectual property estate, and we believe it to be an important asset moving forward.

January 15, 2017 - Biz Dev deal signed with the Jai Group
The Jai Group (JG) is a West Coast business development firm with a focus on pharmaceutical and medical device partnerships in Latin America. gel-e and JG just inked a deal through which JG will identify the best Latin American partners for  gel-e's currently cleared Vascular Access product as well as future products. JG has an excellent track record of obtaining valuable licensing and distribution partnerships in Latin America for their clients.


September 15, 2016 - New Supplemental Grant from the National Science Foundation
gel-e is the recipient of a supplemental grant to our current SBIR Phase II Award from the National Science Foundation for $100,000. The award, called Small-Business / ERC (Engineering Reserach Center) Collaborative Opportunity (SECO), will go towards evaluating the safety of our chitosan-based foam in internal surgical applications. The Company will collaborate with Dr. Steven Stice who works at the Regenerative Engineering and Medicine Research Center, University of Georgia, where the studies will be conducted. This is an exciting development for our internal surgical research program.
