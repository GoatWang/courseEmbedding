Top Image Systems' EFLOW® AP Gaining Traction In The Accounts Payable Automation Market In 2017






GlobeNewswire



Jun 28, 2017 8:01 AM EDT













 


















































 TEL AVIV, Israel and PLANO, Texas, June 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Top Image Systems, Ltd. (NASDAQ:TISA), a global innovator of intelligent content processing solutions, today announced that the company is demonstrating continued momentum for the eFLOW AP solution in 2017. Examples of deals Top Image Systems has closed this year include an agreement with a retail chain in North America through a strategic partner, an expanded license with a leading data management company in India, and transactions with a consumer goods manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer, a leading utilities provider in Germany, and a business process outsourcing partner in the UK.  These deals are an indication that the new eFLOW AP solution is gaining traction, further strengthening the reputation of TIS for delivering scalable accounts payable automation solutions globally. "The growing adoption of our eFLOW AP solution is based on multiple things—an intuitive user experience, which enables finance organizations to control the entire AP process from inside SAP within a familiar environment, the elimination of data redundancy, and the efficient leveraging of existing SAP infrastructure, including new SAP functionalities such as FIORI," said Carsten Nelk, Chief Technology Officer of Top Image Systems.   "We are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with eFLOW AP, particularly within mid-market companies," commented Brendan Reidy, CEO of Top Image Systems. "Our solution enables finance organizations to gain real-time insight into key payment metrics such as Days Payables Outstanding, as well as reduce processing transaction costs while increasing return on invested capital by extending early payment discounts to preferred suppliers. In addition, our existing install base of eFLOW customers who are currently deploying eFLOW to automate the capture of vendor invoices represent upsell opportunities for us to upgrade them to our eFLOW AP solution. Our customers are realizing tangible ROI associated with our accounts payable automation solutions." 1

Digital Business Starts Here Automatically transform incoming business content into digital data that fuels your business processes.

 
 
 




Home About TIS TIS Difference
Accelerating the pace that businesses process inbound document and form data 
At TIS, we’re inspired by the digital transformation happening in today’s business world. The organizations we work with are creating new customer experiences, where the customer journey begins, progresses, and ends in a completely digital environment…and where business processes run at the same fast-paced speed of the market and consumers. This journey begins by transforming all inbound content, documentation, and forms data to a unified digital format at the moment the content enters the organization.



With advanced capture and workflow technology, superior recognition rates, innovative mobile and cloud offerings, and integration with virtually any business system, we help companies achieve the highest rates of straight-through processing possible.
Our proprietary eFLOW platform, which has evolved and improved over the past twenty years, is the foundation of our business process automation solutions.


TIS empowers organizations to build their digital business through four principles:

Onboard inbound information. As business content enters the organization from various channels, automatically capture and organize all data, making it understandable and digitally actionable.
Accelerate customer engagement. Automating labor-intensive, error-prone business processes reduces transaction costs and frees customer-facing staff to focus on higher value exceptions.
Improve service levels and delight customers. Enable proactive customer response management processes based on classifying and routing inbound information to the right department for resolution.
Increase business agility. With better insight into your customers’ sentiments and buying intentions, you can engender repeat business, foster customer loyalty, and generate higher customer lifetime value.
