Mary ErdoesJPMMary Erdoes is one of the most under-the-radar, powerful people on Wall Street.
Erdoes, the CEO of JPMorgan Asset Management, manages the biggest hedge fund in the world, already grew the bank’s client base by a record 15% a year, and she's only 42.
She's also Jamie Dimon's dad's boss. When Dimon hired Ted, his father, last fall in November 2009, he put him in the private client services division, under Erdoes.
In a recent interview, Erdoes told eFinancialNews that managing Ted Dimon, "keeps you on your toes." We doubt Ted Dimon is running over to call his son and tattle on Erdoes for anything, so employing him probably works to her advantage more than anything.
So does this: Erdoes says she works crazy hours (12 hours a day, seven days a week) and Glenn Dubin, who runs JPM's hedge fund, Highbridge, says she always answers emails.
According to Highbrdige's Glenn Dubin, “If there were an Olympic event for responding to emails at all hours from around the world, she’d win a gold medal.”
Someone sleeps with their phone in their hand!
Here are some more interesting things we learned about JPM's hedge fund business from eFinancialNews' profile on Erdoes:

JP Morgan suggests its private clients should take a weighting of 33% in alternatives, twice the average of its rivals. 
During the credit crisis, Highbridge’s assets fell to $17.3bn during the year
Two funds – multi-strategy and Asia – had to gate. Sixty of Highbridge’s 400 staff lost their jobs.
Erdoes plans to hike technology spending 11% this year, to secure more efficiencies.
According to Erdoes, "this is the best opportunity for private equity in 25 years."
JP Morgan has put together a maritime fund, seeking to buy cheap cargo ships and charter them out for a double-figure yields. 
JPM has raised nearly $900m for an Asian infrastructure fund
Erdoes likes Latin America. She says, "We are interested in expanding in emerging markets. Particularly Latin America, which has become increasingly wealthy."
At present, revenues are two-thirds from the US and one-thirds the rest of the world but Erdoes is focused on the split being much nearer 50/50.

Clean Record


This advisor has a clean track record with regulators.






About Wealthminder



Wealthminder was created for one simple reason:
To help people get the financial assistance they need to achieve their long-term financial goals.


Wealthminder is a database of every Investment Advisor Representative in the country.
We work hard to collect and provide you the information you need to find a financial advisor who’s right for you.


If you are looking for a specific financial advisor and you can’t find them on Wealthminder,
it’s likely that they are either exclusively a broker or are unlicensed - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Financial Advisor through Wealthminder



Historically finding and hiring a financial advisor was hard.
Wealthminder was built to make the process much easier.


The best way to use Wealthminder is to take advantage of our free proposal system.
All you have to do is take a few minutes of your time to describe your situation and the assistance you are looking for.


Wealthminder then sends your request to our network of
prescreened financial advisors.
If a financial advisor is interested in your business, they will submit a proposal to you.


You review the proposals you receive and decide if you’d like to have a follow-up call with one or more of the financial advisors.


Throughout the process, you maintain control. We only share your contact information with a financial advisor once you ask for an introduction.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

I need a small personal loan I own my own house and it is paid for butt I am in the middle of fighting with disability I was diagnosed almost four years ago with MS. I need a small loan for $6,000 so I can pay my back taxes. Or at the end of August they're going to take me home and like I said it is paid for they're going to take it for $6,200.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
