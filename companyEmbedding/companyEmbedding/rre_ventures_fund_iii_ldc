Hedge Funds Database
In our Free Hedge Funds Database we have listed more than 4000+ hedge funds and institutional investors. You can see the fund’s summary, employees, AUM, portfolio values, historical 13F, current portfolio, holdings, new positions, sector weights, sentiment, turnover, top 10 holdings and more.
What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

WHO WE AREWe are a New York-based venture capital firm. We believe in unique ideas, we partner with extraordinary teams, and we commit to supporting great companies as they develop and grow. As investors, we pride ourselves on combining experience with open-mindedness. We're a thoughtful investment firm that encompasses independent perspectives, and our decades of expertise complement our enduring hunger for amazing opportunities.WHAT WE'RE ABOUTAt RRE, we are committed to helping founders build category-defining companies in industries ranging from financial services (OnDeck, Avant, Venmo) to 3D printing (Makerbot), and from media (BuzzFeed, Business Insider, TheSkimm) to space and robotics (Jibo, Spaceflight, Spire). We invest primarily in Seed, Series A, and Series B rounds, and we take pride in being active strategic and operational - as well as financial - partners. Our unparalleled network of relationships across multiple industries and countries allows us to help the companies we invest in with strategy, business development, marketing, recruiting, and much more. Simply put, we think of ourselves as being far more than just a source of capital for companies.RRE has raised $1.5 billion across seven funds. While we invest primarily in early and mid-stage businesses, our structure allows us to remain active participants throughout the financing life of a company. Our broad horizon has yielded investments across all forms of hardware, software, and tech-enabled services, and we have had over sixty acquisitions and seventeen IPOs to date. We invest across the United States and in select cases, overseas. With over fifty portfolio companies based in the New York Metro region alone, we are among the area’s most active investors.  Twitter

 What we look forAt RRE we look for credible teams executing against incredible ideas. While our investment decisions are based on many factors, we tend to focus on three main criteria when evaluating a new opportunity.TeamCategory-defining companies are founded by exceptional teams with the relentless spirit and passion necessary for extraordinary execution. Our partners have a deep affinity for the problem they want to solve or the experience they wish to create. This can take several forms, including deep industry expertise, successful prior ventures, demonstrated drive, or all the above. Credible people, incredible ideas... and the ability to execute.ProductGreat teams tend to create great products. That said, we believe that new companies need to create products that are more than incrementally better than existing solutions. Our companies build products creating marketplace resonance that is magnetic and impossible to ignore.  Truly amazing product is what distinguishes a company from numerous other would-be disruptors.MarketThere are many large industries. Only some are ripe for disruption. Similarly, there are many bold ideas for new market categories but only certain moments when these categories can actually emerge. We look at structural and competitive landscapes while harnessing our experience working with the world’s largest corporations to determine whether a market is large, growing, and attackable. We invest in businesses disrupting such markets.  LocationsRRE Ventures Offices130 East 59th Street17th FloorNew York, New York 10022

14: Kathleen Breitman — Tezos Unleashed

July 13, 2017Jason Black

AMLG: Welcome back to the latest episode of Flux. I’m excited for today’s episode. We have Kathleen Breitman, co-founder and CEO of @tezos Tezos is many things but fundamentally it’s a blockchain-based smart contracts platform with built-in governance mechanisms, which allows for formal coordination and upgrades to the protocol. It’s a powerful idea which we’re going to unpack more in this conversation. But the key thing is that there is on-chain governance capability and a functional scripting language. These are desirable traits that people now argue have been missing from other protocols such as Ethereum, which is a leading contender. I’d been sent several emails about Tezos and, being a terrible email shirker, didn’t follow up on them. But the fates brought Kathleen and I together a few weeks ago at a conference in England. We were standing outside, it was freezing and my fingers were falling off when Jack Herrick (@jackh) introduced us. We extricated ourselves from the conference, found one of those portable office pods and shut ourselves in there to chat crypto. We both spent time at the Wall Street Journal under Mary Kissel (shout out to @marykissel if she’s listening) and Bridgewater the mega hedge fund in the woods of Connecticut. No need to read out Kathleen’s extensive bio here but she’s crammed an impressive amount in the last five years since graduating from Cornell. She was a consultant at Accenture and also worked on strategy for R3, the consortium of 40+ banks focused on blockchain tech. She left there in 2016 to pursue Tezos. So that’s a long-winded introduction to Kathleen. I’m especially excited to have her here today because we’re bang in the middle of the Tezos ICO or fundraiser. So I will include a disclaimer before we begin:The ensuing conversation is not a recommendation that any listener participate in the fundraise. Do your own research. You should never invest in something you don’t understand.But I hope you learn something from this conversation nevertheless. Welcome Kathleen.KB: Thank you Alice.AMLG: I guess we should start at the beginning and explain the origins of Tezos. You’re the CEO and co-founder along with your husband Arthur. Husband-wife team and he’s the CTO, the architect. You told me you guys met at a crypto-anarchist meetup in New York in 2010. What is the story there and what kind of pickup lines does one hear at an anarchist meetup?KB: It all starts off in a in a bar near NYU in 2010. I was de-briefing with my debate team. We had just lost mightily to a better school in a debate. There was a party going on at the bar and I was 20 years old and was very tempted at this party by the free-flowing beer, a hot commodity for 20 year olds. I met this guy named Tennyson. Tennyson and I got along just fine and he insisted I come with him to a lunch the next day. He left out a lot of details. The deal-breaker probably would been that it was crypto anarchist lunch — minor detail. The theme of the lunch was not disclosed.So I went in and this guy made a bee-line at me. I was a little weirded out but Tennyson had told Arthur all about me prior to this and I guess he thought that it would be a good match. So shout out to Tennyson. He said “hello, nice to meet you, welcome to the media.” He was friendly and gregarious and tried to figure out all the things I would like and not like. He name-dropped that he knew Milton Friedman’s grandson when I mentioned I liked Milton Friedman. We just kept on talking and I really enjoyed speaking to him and he seemed smart and nice and funny. I meandered through the rest of my Saturday the way I would normally. Then he texted me later and I texted him and we wound up meeting at another bar. Then we wound up going to dinner —AMLG: And you covered all of Milton Friedman?KB: Oh yes it was a rich intellectual history of the Friedmans. Basically we just started talking and we haven’t stopped.AMLG: And Arthur was a quant right. He was at some high frequency trading shops, shops being Goldman.KB: Yes. He studied math and computer science and physics over in France. Then he wanted to work in finance. France isn’t a great place to make a living if you’re under the age of like 50. So instead of going to London which he didn’t really care for he decided to make his bets on New York. So he went to NYU where he studied under Nassem Taleb and the financial engineering group. Then he became a quant. So he was doing high frequency trading and market making for foreign ETFs in particular.AMLG: You’ve said that Arthur is the brains and you’re at the brawn. What do you mean by that?KB: Arthur is really the technical architect, he came up with the structure. Tezos has gone in and out of fashion — the ideas — over the last three or four years. People really took interest in it last year when the DAO occurred. This was a fantastic heist of sorts. A digital heist.ALMG: Could you explain what happened there, with the DAO hack?In April 2016 14% of all Ether ($150m at the time) was deposited into the DAO, a smart contract (computer program) running on Ethereum. A few bad lines of code in the contract enabled a hacker to steal $50m in June 2016. The community ultimately decided to resolve the hack by hard forking Ethereum, which resulted in two coins, ETH and ETCKB: There was a project that aspired to be a decentralized venture capital organization on the Ethereum blockchain called the DAO. They had about $150 million dollars worth of Ether pledged to the contract. This was an ambitious undertaking and the people who created the DAO didn’t do a super thorough job of security audits and wondering if they could actually mobilize this vision they had created. So a clever hacker gave himself some of the Ether out of this contract to the tune of $50 million dollars out of the $150 million.AMLG: That’s a good steal.KB: Not bad if you can get it. So this forced a conversation in the Ethereum community as to whether or not there ought to be a do over. Call it a mulligan, if you will, on this whole DAO fiasco. That led to a split in the chain of Ethereum, which is how we got two versions: Ethereum Classic which is favored by some people in the community because it didn’t unwind this transaction — it forced people to deal with the consequences of this heist. And then regular Ethereum or Ethereum as we know it today, which basically called a do over. This was ultimately a governance question and the whole nexus of Tezos is — governance is very much a part of blockchains, we can’t divorce the math and computer science aspect from the overall governing philosophy. So this forced a conversation.AMLG: So when there’s a fork and a community has to vote on a direction there’s basically an informal process that’s determined by perceptions, perception of which fork seems most authoritative or valid or which constituents shout the loudest which is what we saw after the DAO hack. This is the problem you’re trying to solve with Tezos — you’re trying to formalize the process of how one upgrades a protocol?KB: So the Tezos position paper examines the potential threats to bitcoin. Ethereum was not factored into the analysis in the initial white paper or position paper, but yes essentially the idea is that ultimately these systems are very fragile in the sense that if you have undue influence over the protocol on this soft level you can render different results at the protocol level.You see this with bitcoin. You have core developers who have personalities and it kind of becomes a cult of personality over who you’re with and people taking sides on Twitter. But there’s no meaningful way to enact change. In the sense that ultimately you’re at the behest of miners in China over which version of the protocol is actually deployed.AMLG: So your mechanism allows blockchain to change the blockchain itself. Very meta, turtles all the way down there. Your central idea was — you saw this fallacy underlying bitcoin, that code can solve everything. Or as Arthur puts it, nothing bad can happen to bitcoin because MATH. But really blockchains are embedded in society, society can be compromised. So this is what you’re getting at with Tezos right. The question I have that follows — under the current construction isn’t there a risk that the network favors the people who are more technical, the more technical stakeholders who are knowledgeable about anything that you would vote to change? What do you do for the non technically-savvy tokenholders?Read more in the Tezos OverviewKB: That’s a good question. We have what’s called delegated proof-of-stake in our system. Essentially what this means is that everyone who owns a token can become a validator in the network. Or they can actually assign that right to someone else and that person can vote on their behalf. So there is going to be some element of politicking, but at least it’ll be something where people can express that in a much more legitimate way than just saying that that guy’s right because —AMLG: So sort of a proxy vote.KB: It’s a proxy vote yes. Some people call it liquid democracy.AMLG: But you can never really remove the element of humans influencing other humans’ ideas right, it’s just the voting piece?KB: Most definitely. That’s an important caveat. That’s why it’s an experimental piece of technology. Ultimately this is still going by people’s judgment, which is of course always subject to some sort of fallacy. The main innovation with Tezos is giving a way to air legitimacy on the chain. Right now it’s sinuous as to how decisions are made. By making things more explicit we hope that we can get more useful conversations going.There has been a long-standing debate over how to increase the bitcoin block size. Under the current 1MB block capacity, network congestion is resulting in higher transaction times and processing fees. BIP-148 and SegWit2 form two of the top scaling proposals, and are set to update the network on August 1st, dubbed Bitcoin Independence Day. There is a possibility of a chain split, an event that would result in two separate bitcoins. [More info]AMLG: It’s super relevant now since we’re seeing this play out with massive battles over block size in bitcoin, whether to go with BIP-148 or SegWit2. Maybe you could just fit Tezos into the landscape for the listeners. You’ve said previously that the Bitcoin model is so decentralized that it’s beholden to these populist campaigns and there’s this governance deadlock. Then on the other side, Ethereum is moving very fast but is very centralized because the Foundation has a lot of clout over the protocol. Where do you fit on that spectrum?KB: In some ways we’re choosing a middle ground between the two and in other ways we’re taking a radically different approach. So a little about how Tezos governance works in its first iteration: what we’re going to do is a two-phased vote. We’re taking our cues from the Republic of Venice and we’re doing affirmative voting on the first iteration. So what would you like to test. So say six people have proposed these things and they all have different tradeoffs, what we want to actually test and see if it’s useful for the protocol. What’s the proposition here.AMLG: Then that proposition has to pass a threshold to get the main vote?KB: Yes after testing. We’ll spin up a testnet. It will say for example, well you said that this preserves privacy but we actually found that it does not.AMLG: What happens if you don’t get people over a certain level? Some of the DAO propositions won only 5 or 6% the votes.KB: One way of approaching that is delegation — making it easy to not have to think critically about every proposal. If you take a vacation you shouldn’t have to worry too much about the network.AMLG: Right and it’s very easy to bash every option down.KB: But we also adjust the quorum every time. For instance maybe people just want two people making all the decisions. That’s a weird outcome certainly but it’s possible.AMLG: Is it possible that Ethereum could change its governance structure?KB: They could introduce different roles for people. They could introduce something like a representative democracy. But the innovation with Tezos is that we can actually iterate on our governance model. We can adjust it at the meta level. That’s something you have to bake into the protocol at the base layer.AMLG: They really can’t bake it in at this stage — it’s done?KB: I think it would be remarkably difficult. I’m not going to underestimate Vitalik of course. But with Tezos we don’t just have this governance layer, we also have a way of pushing the upgrades out to everyone, it’s one and the same, making it a very powerful mechanism. Whereas bitcoin and Ethereum still have manual processes for updating their chain.AMLG: You’ve said yours is modular, with the three layers swappable — you can swap things in and out?Tezos distinguishes three protocols: the network, transaction and consensus protocols. The transaction and consensus layers are implemented in an isolated module plugged into a generic network shell responsible for maintaining the blockchain.KB: Yes. It’s called a hot swap on the protocol.AMLG: Hot swap on the protocol. Well Vitalik is a brilliant guy, but I did love the fact that your smart contract language is Michelson—KB: Michelson. At least that’s how French developers pronounce it. I actually don’t know, I mispronounce everything —AMLG: How’s your blockchain French?KB: Better than my blockchain English.AMLG: But so it’s a reference to the Michelson-Morley experiment, which disproved Aether right? Not to be confused with Ether. That’s hilarious. I love that you guys throw those little things in.KB: It’s the only cheeky thing we’ve done.AMLG: The other interesting thing is that you’ve built in incentives for developers — bounties and invoice potential on the chain.KB: Yes. So I think a big failing of open source technology nowadays is that you basically have corporates sponsoring it because they use it in some capacity and that’s kind of how these things are governed. But outside of a group of enthusiasts and people who have a vested interest in its success you don’t find too many people actively trying to contribute just for the sake of it or for pecuniary gain. We decided early on that that would be a massive inhibitor to innovation in these blockchain protocols. Because at the beginning at least they seem to appeal to ideologues — which mind you is fine — but I like the idea of having someone from a university who’s been studying something on the periphery and incentivizing them to contribute to the protocol, even if they don’t find the ideological aspects of it appetizing.AMLG: For the mercenary engineers out there.KB: There are many of them.AMLG: Really you guys have been working on this for a while but it feels like you’re just making your entrance onto the scene more. In the grand scheme of course it’s still very early, but surely many of the folks interested in the space have already taken stakes in other competing ledgers? How have you navigated these existing vested interests and converted people to the Tezzie religion? I know you’ve said that community building has turned out to be one of the hardest parts.KB: It’s genuinely really tough. I think that’s part of the reason we did an uncapped crowd sale. When we were thinking of the best way to get Tezos backing from people, it wasn’t obvious to us how to do it. But one way is to make sure that everyone has the ability to take part in the ecosystem. People having an interest in you and contributing to your fundraiser is a way to get them interested in the technology.AMLG: You really opened it up broadly with the fundraiser.KB: Absolutely.AMLG: Should we not be saying ICO?KB: I mean it is a fundraiser. People call it an ICO. But it is a fundraiser. I was thinking of making tote bags like PBS tote bags.AMLG: Because people are donating to a nonprofit.KB: Exactly. And the non-profit is recommending an allocation of tokens.AMLG: Let’s step back for a second and lay out the landscape for people who haven’t seen all the headlines on ICOs. What’s a quick explainer on an initial coin offering and what have you done so far.KB: Basically there are a number of new projects in this space and one way to distribute the token is to simply receive donations to their blockchain and then in return you get the token. And typically they’ll price it at a certain number of Bitcoin or ethereum and deploy it right away. So it’s an alternative financing structure for some projects and for some projects it’s a distribution mechanismAMLG: And the tokens are not securities.KB: I mean in some cases they could be right, like if you have a claim on a line of revenue. Arguably that’s a security. But with Tezos you’re basically getting computing power on a decentralized blockchain.AMLG: So in your case they’re not. As of today it’s Thursday July 6th 2:30pm, about 51,000 bitcoin and 28,0000 ethereum have been contributed with seven days to go. It’s so exciting. It’s like a reality show.Let’s get into some of the questions that have been raised — we ought to cover a few. I admit when I first heard some of the facts about Tezos I was skeptical. It’s easy to fall into cynicism. There’s all these keyboard warriors on Reddit throwing out one liners. But the papers you’ve put out actually give clear and well-thought out answers to some of these mainstream public questions. I want to get into a few of them. The first thing I want to ask is about the pushback over the fact that the fundraiser is uncapped. Uncapped meaning there’s no upper limit on the funds you can raise. The limit is just the time, the window in which you’re raising — two weeks. In the Tezos overview you state the reason for this which I will read here:“There is no cap on the amount of contributions that will be accepted. This is done in order to ensure that participation is not limited only to insiders or the fast fingered. The Tezos team believes that an uncapped fundraiser will promote a widespread distribution of the tokens a necessary prerequisite to launching a robust network.”So that inclusive argument instinctively makes sense to me. But of course the problem with democracy is democracy. The system itself. Crowds don’t always get things right and in this case your crowd may be speculators. There’s been a lot of speculative buying in China for instance. Do you worry about who the tokenholders are and whether their incentives are aligned with Tezos?KB: It’s tough. We didn’t do much marketing outside of the U.S. Well rather Arthur and I are based in the U.S. and we talk about the technology in mainstream U.S. press outlets and sometimes it’s picked up in Asian outlets. We mostly have just been evangelizing about the technology. But certainly there are a lot of people who are interested in the more speculative aspects. I think there’s a lot of fervor and froth in the marketplace right now. That does make it a bit odd to launch something that’s more community-based on some level when there’s a lot of people who are just profit-seeking. I suppose I do worry but ultimately we’re appealing to people’s rational self-interest. So at the end of the day I hope that the proper incentives will align themselves.AMLG: And that the tokens end up in the right hands, with people who align with your values?KB: Yes.AMLG: Let’s talk about the structure, which is the other question people ask, and fiduciary liabilities. You’ve laid out the Tezos Foundation’s goal is to promote the use of the Tezos protocol. So participants in the crowd sale donate to the Swiss Foundation which in turn provides the contributors with a token allocation. You’ve said the Foundation will spend on conferences, marketing, funding developers. If your director decided he wanted to buy an island in the Caribbean who votes on that? How does the corporate structure work?KB: That’s a good question. Part of the reason this is not a security is because you have no claim on the revenue and that includes the revenue from the fundraiser. The Tezos Foundation is at the behest of the Swiss nonprofit authority, which has a clear directive to adhere to whatever the Tezos foundation sets out to do. So if Johann wants to buy a Caribbean island where there there’s a ton of Ocaml programmers that’s kosher if Johann wants —AMLG: So if they program better there it’s OK — as long as productivity goes up.KB: Ha yes. If Johann wants to buy a Caribbean island because he wants to run it on the Tezos blockchain in some way, I guess that falls in line with it. But if he wants to do it because — well he’s quite pale so I don’t know if he wants to go tanning — but if he wants to go on vacation and buy an island that would not be OK. You could theoretically hold him accountable under Swiss law. And I think that the Foundation ought to survey the community for major decisions to reflect their will better. But there’s no explicit voting mechanism on it. Part of the reason that’s not such a bad thing is that anyone can contribute to the protocol. There’s the Foundation which has veto power for one year, but other than that they don’t have any favored status in the protocol.AMLG: It’s amazing how you’re paving the way and there doesn’t seem to be any regulatory framework for what you’re doing. What was your thinking on going to Switzerland? I know that the U.S. money transmission laws are nuts on a state by state basis, it’s so complex here. But it sounds like it’s complex there as well. What are your thoughts on how the regulatory framework will evolve?KB: Well Johann is the founder of the Crypto Valley in Zug, which is a Canton in Zurich. It has a ton of Bitcoin companies it has a ton of watching companies located there and including Ethereum foundation.AMLG: So I guess they paved the way. Do you think others will follow — do you think there’s a best practice being set here?KB: I think so. There are other a few other places — Gnosis which is an ethereum prediction market token I think they had their token sale out of Gibraltar. Estonia wants to do work around this. I think the Ethereum foundation itself is actually in Singapore right now. So there’s all sorts of accommodating usually small nations that are willing to work with you.AMLG: You gotta love the small nations. So the other major thing that’s gone on during the fundraiser which you’ve had to deal with is serious attacks. I’ve seen phishing attempts all over the Internet, fake accounts on Twitter, Reddit. It seems like you’ve learned a lot about DDOS resilience and you’ve probably a lot of sleepless nights. How have you managed key security during this process?KB: Oh geez. It’s a good question. We have some very clever engineers is the short answer. The long answer is that my husband is a hobbyist infosec researcher so he thought of an elaborate way of securing the site against DDOS measures. He worked with friends at AWS and Cloudflare who were willing to give us some of their time and services. We have a pretty sophisticated operation going on right now. We’ll be releasing a white paper that goes over what we did and we will be licensing out the software. Apparently it was quite an undertaking. The long and short of it is that it was a lot of work. With the phishing honestly it was about communicating to the group that there would be no pre-sale deals and being hardasses when people were asking.AMLG: What were the main channels Twitter or Reddit or where did you —KB: We made the mistake of creating a slack channel, which was terrible because you can DM people without any permissioning on who can DM who. So there were people private messaging and trying to convince folks that they were on the inside.AMLG: Do you have any idea who these people are?KB: It’s funny because three weeks before the sale someone masqueraded as Emin Gün Sirer who’s one of our advisors, a professor at Cornell. He was pretending to be someone who could get someone in on the sale. This guy used the photo that Emin uses on Twitter and his name and likeness. But the one snag in his plan was that he registered with his main email. So I was immediately able to be like hey Gün, this guy is pretending to be you.AMLG: Not a good infosec move really. I at least use my hotmail account when I’m registering to hack thingsKB: That’s very good of you. Now I know. But yes you just get very unsophisticated people, you get both idiots and then you get folks who go out in full force. We had a group that was making accounts that said Community Manager with a woman’s name every 15 minutes and had to shut it down manually. It was really bad.What I learned from this whole process is that Slack is terrible for public groups. It’s terrible on a few levels. It’s terrible because the DM aspect you don’t have any control over. You don’t have granular permissions as to who can control what. And you don’t have threading of conversations. What broke Arthur and me in the first three or four months after we announced Tezos was going to be released was people who kept asking the same questions over and over again. It drove us crazy.AMLG: Like what?KB: When ICO? What cap? Why no cap? People would get irritated that the questions are repeated. People would get irritated that Arthur and I would not take the time to go into thoughtful answers every time.AMLG: You could just point them to the answer.KB: You could yes but they want to hear from you. Just to be sure. That grated on us. Whereas with Reddit people like to yell and they like —AMLG: I only observe on Reddit. I don’t dare say anything because I get smacked down quickly.KB: The only way to win is not to play. But at least with Reddit you can reference threads and iterate on that so you don’t get the same questions over and over again. That’s really a big thing with Slack.AMLG: Why is it there so much nastiness in the blockchain crypto world — is it just smart people with opinions strongly held? Or is it monetary reasons?KB: I think people are just naturally inclined towards taking sides, you see this in politics too. “I’m team Ethereum. Ethereum is going up 4,000X why don’t you like ethereum, why do you think you’re better than Ethereum?” Right.AMLG: But actually it seems like you cooperate with a lot of the other folks in the space. I mean Zcash, Zooko — he’s one of your advisors right?KB: Oh yes Zooko. In general we have a good working relationship with most of the people in the space that we admire. It’s really folks who can’t evaluate our technology who get really upset with us and start to caterwaul. You can’t let that get to you. Honestly if you look back at Ethereum people were much more vicious. So we got off pretty easy on the vilification front. Most of the attacks have been very personal. But I’ve been on the internet since I was 12. And I worked at Bridgewater so I have thick skin.AMLG: All the character building you needed.KB: Exactly. You’ll have to come at me a little harder if you want to hurt my feelings.AMLG: How do you cope with the stress, the two of you. I guess you’re both moving around internationally and busy, but you are in a relationship with each other —KB: I mean, it’s compartmentalizing. Sometimes it’s “OK right now you’re my business partner and I’m telling you that this is a terrible idea.” And sometimes it’s “I know you’re stressed out. We should really talk about this. But let’s first see a movie or watch bad TV.” I think we just know each other really well.AMLG: What is your go-to bad TV?KB: The new like 24 spin off, Designated Survivor. It’s just so awful.AMLG: Your brain doesn’t even need to be switched on.KB: It’s just its so stupid. It’s really fantastic because it’s like conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory and you can’t quite trace it.AMLG: And your parents now know that you’re doing this right? I know you were “a financial software engineer” for a while.KB: Yeah I was doing “accounting software.” Now they’re on to me. My mother unfortunately has learned what Reddit is like. But she still loves me which is great. She doesn’t seem to be assuaged by the arguments that I’m an incompetent boob or just terrible. So I’ve got that going. My mother still loves me.AMLG: I’m curious to zoom out for a minute on your self-identification as an An-Cap. What exactly is an anarchist capitalist, in rough terms?KB: In general its someone who believes that markets do a better job of distributing goods than the government. They tend to have a preference against government aggression in any form.AMLG: You put at the top of your white paper “laissez faire les proprietaires” which sums up a lot of this. You’ve said the whole cypherpunk movement is about using the Internet to free people both informationally but also financially. It’s interesting to think about how Tezos and the work you’ve been doing builds upon decades of thinking. Privacy advocates have been organizing in Silicon Valley since the 80s — guys like David Chaum, Timothy May and that cypherpunk mailing list. Which then evolved into the cryptography mailing list where you got started. I have a quote from May’s manifesto which I thought would be fun to read:“Just as the technology of printing altered and reduce the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure. So too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.” That was 1988 — 20 or so odd years before Bitcoin. People have wanted this for a long time and then cryptocurrencies raised their head again in the mid 2000s and then boom Satoshi. Where do you see yourself fitting into this long history of crypto anarchist capitalists?KB: To your point it’s been a series of failures and a series of people who are a bit too far ahead of their time. So I hope my timing is right. It is just massively experimental. So we have to take that into account. Bitcoin is the new fad. It’s the new fashion. People like to talk about it because it invites people to think about a world without intermediaries as they know it. That’s cool. Maybe bitcoin isn’t the end game. Maybe it’s some other application that’s built. But I think it’s a very inspirational piece of technology.AMLG: Where did it start for you? Was there an Atlas Shrugged moment when you were young. Did you read some book?KB: My parents are both pretty far to the right and classical conservatives. My dad subscribed to National Review when I was little and it was like read this. So I grew up with a more right-leaning bias. Then I read Milton Friedman when I was like 16. He died in 2006 when I was 16 and I read his obituary written by Amity Shlaes. It was eloquent and talked about how Friedman really cared about people’s ability to prosper and make commerce for themselves and that was a nice idea. I think instinctually I don’t like being told what to do. I don’t like any form of tyranny. Even the more mundane types like being told to go to class.AMLG: I’m surprised you made it through college.KB: I’m surprised too. My parents are surprised I made it through college. I’m surprised I made it through high school. So I think just habitually I didn’t like authority and given that I was already oriented towards the right and caring more about markets than anything else as a way to distribute resources, it seemed like a natural fit both with my upbringing and my own instinctual biases.AMLG: I was on Twitter this morning and I thought you would enjoy this article that Andy Weissman of USV tweeted out. So a prominent theoretical physicist, Yaneer Bar-Yam, who crunches big data and generally analyzes complex systems — he actually accurately predicted the Arab Spring — he borrowed mathematical frameworks from quantum field theory and did a study on government. He found something that we have already been thinking about — that hierarchal systems no longer work given how complex society has become and how globally interconnected we are. Hierarchies used to work in smaller kingdoms but since the 1980s there’s been a breakdown. Whether it’s a financial crisis or environmental issues or diseases, it’s just too complex for a few entities or people at the top to respond to and decide on policy. At the end of this analysis he proposed a shift to “horizontal distributed governance” which to me points straight to you.KB: Why didn’t he publish this like six weeks ago.AMLG: He also looks at the brain. If you think about the brain there isn’t one neuron telling the other neurons what to do. There’s a collective behavior that’s responsible for how we think and decide. As you read this research you think OK this makes sense, everything is too complex, but then what’s the mechanism?KB: Yeah part of the reason that we set up Tezos the way we did — and we could have been way more prescriptive with the initial governance model — the reason we chose a vanilla two-phase vote was because we didn’t want to be too prescriptive. It took society thousands of years to come upon the institutions that we have today. There are subtleties that you just can’t quite capture. You can’t capture them for a variety of reasons. Part of the limitation is that Tezos is going to be digital commonwealth. That means it’s not going to be particularly tangible outside of the world of the Internet. But also there’s a lot of counterintuitive things when you look at government and the way it works today and the way liabilities work.One of my favorite books which has just been updated is David Friedman’s “Legal Systems Very Different from Ours.” It talks about things like punishment structures in different societies and cultures. It’s interesting because you’re always trying to optimize for one thing and you’re not always super sure what types of incentives you’re building in. One of my favorite anecdotes is that in the 1970s in Vietnam they used to give money out for rat pelts. The idea was they wanted to get rats out of the cities. What happened instead was that there were elaborate rat farms. You can’t always fine tune human behavior. You never quite know it’s going to happen. So it’s best to take a wait and see approach and see how communities emerge and how they self-organize.AMLG: Why the name Tezos?KB: When we were coming up with the name Arthur wanted an original .com so he wrote an algorithm to find an unclaimed .com that was pronounceable in English. Apparently it’s slang in Colombian teenager speak on Twitter for “expert.” So that’s a massive freebie.AMLG: I was looking for hidden meanings in the logo. It looks like there’s a three in there?KB: The logo is a unicode character (U+A729) from a Mayan language, the T and Z there. I bought the unicode character “dot com” in case anyone tries to get cheeky. Though if anyone types that in I want to meet them and say come work with me. So it’ll double as a resume-building exercise.AMLG: So what happens next. The fundraiser finishes next week. Then what. What do you think will be the killer app — to use the worst term in venture capital. Who are your core customers? What types of use cases are you excited about?KB: In general I think people have been trying to seek out the killer app of blockchains a bit too eagerly and haven’t really waited to see if the technology itself is reliable. So we’re trying to build the most consistently executed blockchain that we can. That’s on the engineering side. But then realistically this has to have some utility. I think there are cool use cases around things like online gaming, those are kind of low hanging fruit in my opinion. Where this starts to get interesting is where you can integrate with more traditional industries and start to break the wall there. What does a completely decentralized micro-insurance agency look like? What does a secondary market look like? I’m pursuing some interesting partnerships and business development ideas. I don’t want to show my cards too early but I think it’s going to be an interesting summer for Tezos from that perspective.I’ve been approached by any number of businesses from healthcare to finance to online gaming, all of which I think have a potential use case. The problem becomes how do you prioritize your time. I know for me I’d rather be doing business development meetings and going around evangelizing the technology rather than making sure that the fundraiser is set up in a secure way. Alas the responsible thing to do was to man the fundraiser and make sure it got out in the best and most professional way and not focus so much on doing POCs. Really what I want to do for Tezos in the next year is kind of prove the need for smart contracts as a way to in some ways disintermediate third parties and in other ways to prove that there could be a completely digital economy that works.AMLG: How are you going to come down from all of this. Is there going to be 24 hours or 12 hours where you don’t have to caffeinate and you can decompress?KB: I tried that — it did not work. I don’t know. I’m kind of on a high right now I guess. Because we didn’t think this would ever happen. Tezos has been dead in the water several times over. It’s surreal that people are connecting to the message. I’m really happy about that. It’s great gratification for Arthur and myself.AMLG: Thats awesome. So I know we’ve both got to get going — thank you so much for taking the time to chat.KB: Thank you for having me.***

Our Investment in Clarity Money

March 23, 2017Cooper Zelnick

RRE Ventures is excited to announce our Series B investment in Clarity Money, the next-generation personal financial manager focused on empowering consumers with an intelligent financial advocate.The recent proliferation of apps targeted at improving users’ financial health is no secret: over the past few years dozens of companies have sought to tackle the problem of enabling users to save more, spend less, invest more, invest more intelligently, begin to budget, budget better, the list goes on. However, this market is crowded with solutions targeted at the small subset of individuals willing and able to mine their financial data, create budgets, and then take direct action to improve their financial situations.Clarity Money is an app designed for everyone else. Adam Dell and the Clarity Money team believe that there is a much bigger (if less visible) market of people who have trouble taking proactive steps to improve their financial health because of the confusing and overwhelming landscape of financial products and the institutions which offer them. Clarity’s product delivers on the promise of simplifying financial choices and acting on behalf of consumers to boost their financial wellness and health. For the lucky few who have the time and ability to fully optimize their financial lives, tools are plentiful. For the rest of us, there’s Clarity Money.“Clarity Money is exactly the type of deal I like to do,” says RRE Managing Partner Stuart Ellman, who has joined Clarity’s board. “Adam Dell is an experienced entrepreneur who I’ve known for twenty years and funded before. He’s assembled an experienced team to tackle a meaningful problem in a massive space.”Clarity Money offers users the ability to link their various accounts and get a comprehensive yet simple picture of their overall financial health. The app also enables users to budget more effectively, set up automatic savings, and cancel subscriptions or other recurring payments. But more importantly, Clarity acts as a trusted financial advisor and advocate, intelligently saving consumers money by renegotiating bills on users’ behalfs and referring users to financial products which are more affordable and better suited to their needs.In so doing, the Clarity Money team is democratizing financial wellness, bringing the thoughtful, personalized, financial management solutions currently available to high-net-worth individuals to everyone. We could not be more excited to partner with a proven entrepreneur focused on building a sustainable business by improving the financial lives of all individuals.

Our Investment in Workit Health

March 06, 2017Cooper Zelnick

RRE Ventures is excited to announce our seed investment in Workit Health, an affordable, effective, and on-demand addiction treatment program for the millions of Americans struggling with substance use. Originally offered exclusively through employers, Workit’s treatment program is now available directly to consumers, delivering a crucial service to individuals: freedom from addiction.Addiction is an enormous problem in the United States, affecting over 20 million Americans, with an additional 60 million engaged in risky patterns of use with alcohol and/or drugs. Of those, only 10% receive adequate treatment, often because existing treatment options are too expensive, too disruptive to be practical, or do not align with their health goals. What’s worse is that access to treatment is often not enough: relapse rates associated with traditional addiction treatment programs exceed 50%.While new, evidence-based treatment modalities and technological innovations have improved our understanding of addiction, that understanding has yet to be implemented in the form of accessible, affordable, evidence-based care for high-need individuals. With most diseases, clinicians seek to identify, isolate, and then treat conditions as early as possible, reducing costs and boosting outcomes. But when it comes to addiction, we wait until patients have “crashed,” and only then begin to treat the underlying conditions. The costs are staggering, in this case about $35 billion annually, and all too often the outcomes for individuals and their loved ones are catastrophic.Workit Health is solving this problem by delivering care which is affordable, evidence-based, judgment-free, and accessible to all individuals on their own terms. Moreover, their program is sustainable: individuals receive ongoing care beyond the initial ninety-day program. And if this methodology for treating addiction seems obvious, the implications of the program cannot be overstated.






Workit’s program contains 6 core modules: my mission, body, mind, heart, spirit, and tribe. Users who have finished the core program continue to Onward, which provides continued support in the form of engaging curriculum and aftercare.



The promise of Workit Health for consumers is exceedingly powerful. Finally, seeking treatment for addiction or risky behaviors is not at odds with continuing to work, to live, and to remain in one’s community. Workit’s program delivers a value proposition for employers which far exceeds the mere reduction of staff turnover, absenteeism, and workplace accidents as well. The true promise of Workit is the promise of compassionate, visionary, and highly effective treatment for everyone regardless of circumstance, geographic location, or ability to pay.We’re honored to join Lisa, Robin, and the rest of the Workit Health team as they realize their vision and revolutionize the way addiction is understood, perceived, and treated across the United States.

Our Investment in Pebble Post

February 28, 2017Jason Black

Today we are excited to announce our lead investment in PebblePost’s $15M Series B.Over the last decade, advertising and marketing technology has gone through a massive transformation. Digital retargeting, social media channels, personalization, and - most recently - programmatic, have quickly become vital to the success of the modern CMO. To date though, one marketing channel has been left behind: direct mail.Understandably so. Bits and bytes are the low hanging fruit. Our own portfolio reflects some of the players in that first wave of revolution. Sailthru leverages this flexibility to build email software that individually personalized email based on hundreds of data points. Beeswax enables companies to programmatically buy ads across the web based on a company’s proprietary data sets at scale, and tweak and tune that optimization in real time.But as digital channels start to saturate, marketers are looking for new, differentiated, and highly engaging ways to reconnect with their existing customers, and intelligently reach out to new ones. Despite the disadvantages of printing and delivering a piece of snail mail, direct mail is a massive industry (~$50B/yr) for one simple reason — it works. It works despite the fact that the most sophisticated providers rely solely on demographic and geo-targeting data. The tools and capabilities, however, have kept modern marketing professionals from wading into its opaque, slow moving industry.Enter PebblePost. To call PebblePost a direct mail company is like calling Amazon a bookstore. By marrying the best of traditional direct mail with the best of digital advertising, the company empowers marketers to transform real-time interest and intent data into high quality, personalized, postcards and catalogs. This enables PebblePost to re-engage existing customers and, critically, target website prospects who have yet to convert. Because it begins online, the PebblePost platform can match a return visit and provide real-time analytics on response, conversion and ROAS, allowing digital marketers to optimize their campaigns just as they would on other programmatic platforms. The advantages can’t be overstated.The results don’t disappoint. Taken together, the PebblePost platform has enabled clients to perform 10x better than traditional direct mail campaigns and a full 100x digital retargeting campaigns.As venture investors, we invest in companies that use data and technology as a leverage point to create new business opportunities and build in step-function increases in performance and usability. PebblePost does both in a big way.We couldn’t be more excited to be a partner along their journey in transforming what direct mail can do for brands around the globe.

Our Investment in Knock: Home Selling Finally Enters The Age Of The Internet

January 31, 2017Raju Rishi

RRE Ventures is excited to announce our Series A investment in Knock, the modern way to sell your home. Knock — co-founded by former Trulia founding team members Sean Black and Jamie Glenn, along with co-founder and Chief Architect Karan Sakhuja — utilizes historical market and transaction data, machine learning, and intelligent pricing algorithms to predict home prices with unparalleled accuracy and to alleviate the pain of selling (and buying) a home. By guaranteeing individuals the ability to sell their home within 6 weeks, Knock reduces the hassle, uncertainty, and inefficiency of selling a home. And by offering to buy homes outright from homeowners, Knock solves a key pain point for the 47% of US homebuyers who must sell their existing home in order to afford a new one.The proliferation of tech-enabled marketplaces represents disruption at its best. In aggregating a near limitless number of potential buyers and sellers, these marketplaces have the potential to increase price transparency and drive transactional efficiency. This not only creates value for businesses, but drives significant value to consumers, saving people money and time. And nowhere are these savings more important than in the residential real estate market, given that buying a home is often the most significant financial decision an individual will make.Over the past several years, the promise of fully efficient marketplaces has been realized even in historically slow-moving industries like commercial real estate. Today, startups like 42Floors and The Square Foot (an RRE portfolio company) are bringing commercial listings online, while Hightower (another RRE portfolio company, which recently merged with VTS) is driving efficiency by arming brokers with intelligent tools for managing leasing workflows.Yet despite this proliferation of new marketplace businesses, one space has been left behind. Until now, there has been no true tech-enabled marketplace for selling residential real estate. We believe that this market is finally ripe for disruption, and there exists no better team to execute against Knock’s vision.By bringing listings online in a searchable way, companies like Zillow create transparency in the residential real estate market, enabling consumers to search directly for properties. However, the actual transaction process remains time consuming, inefficient, and expensive for sellers and buyers alike. While Zillow renders properties searchable, potential buyers and sellers are still forced to contact a broker, hire a series of professionals to assist with the closing process, and wait months to complete a transaction. And the stakes are high; if a sale falls through, a family may no longer be able to afford the new house they were planning to buy.Knock solves this problem in an elegant and thoughtful way. The immediate resonance of Knock’s value proposition with consumers serves as further evidence that despite the prevalence of online real estate listings, actually buying and selling a home remains a legacy experience. Fundamentally, Knock is a transaction-oriented marketplace for real estate. Two of Knock’s co-founders having deep domain expertise as founding team members of Trulia made Knock an especially compelling investment for us. Moreover, the rest of the Knock team are uniquely positioned to solve this problem. The promise of Knock is that a homeowner can sell his or her house within six weeks, or that Knock will buy it directly. This is the promise of the truly efficient marketplace. We couldn’t be more excited to work with Sean, Jamie and the rest of the team at Knock.(Thank you to my RRE colleague Cooper Zelnick for helping with this post)

BUILDING BRIDGES, AND THE FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE

January 24, 2017Raju Rishi

RRE Ventures is excited to announce our Series B investment in Redox, the modern API for healthcare. Redox is building a highly scalable network which integrates healthcare applications and health systems. Today, Redox is the leading healthcare integration platform with the largest ecosystem of enterprise applications. And tomorrow, Redox will become a powerful force for the achievement of better data, better patient care, and better outcomes across our nation’s entire healthcare system."The thesis which led to our investment in Redox is simple," said Raju Rishi and Cooper Zelnick, who have joined Redox's board. "The proliferation of consumer healthcare devices, the explosion of healthcare applications, and the trend towards data-driven healthcare creates an enormous opportunity for patients, providers, and payers alike." However, the complexity of legacy electronic health records and other healthcare technologies has made it increasingly difficult for healthcare system CIOs to keep up with the demands of both doctors and patients for application integrations. As a result, healthcare feels like an industry left behind by the data revolution. We believe that the true promise of value-based care and dramatically improved outcomes will not be realized until new technologies can rapidly penetrate existing healthcare systems.After meeting Luke, Niko, and James, Redox’s three co-founders, we knew we had found the team to solve this problem. And since launching in 2014, they’ve done just that. Their extensive backgrounds in healthcare interoperability (all three worked for Epic Systems in Madison Wisconsin) makes them uniquely positioned to understand and solve this key problem in healthcare. Our partnership with Redox represents not only an investment in a painful problem within a massive space, but also an investment in an unparalleled team of passionate domain experts.Redox is the first and only company developing a networked approach to healthcare interoperability. After evaluating the landscape of interoperability solution providers, we came to believe that businesses enabling one-off, point-to-point healthcare connections fall short of achieving the ultimate goal of data liquidity in healthcare. Redox, with its scalable, reusable infrastructure and standardized data models, has created a unique, elegant, and exceedingly valuable solution to this problem.Coupled with the Redox team’s deep technical expertise, the company’s location in Madison, Wisconsin gives Redox several key competitive advantages beyond unparalleled access to craft beer and cheese curds. Luke, Niko, James, and the rest of the Redox team are recognized as thought leaders within Madison’s health tech ecosystem, enabling the company to recruit talent, operate efficiently, and secure key partnerships in a large and growing market. We look forward to working closely with the Redox team as they help payors, providers, and patients work together to realize the promise of better, cheaper, smarter healthcare for everyone.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
