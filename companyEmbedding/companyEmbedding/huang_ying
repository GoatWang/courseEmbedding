Product Market Competition and Managerial Disclosure of Earnings Forecasts: Evidence from Import Tariff Rate Reductions

Abstract
This study examines the effect of product market competition on managerial disclosure of earnings forecasts using large reductions in U.S. import tariff rates to identify an exogenous increase in competition for domestic firms in U.S. product markets. Our difference-in-difference estimations show that tariff reductions are associated with a significant decrease in management forecasts of annual earnings by U.S. domestic firms. Further, this decrease is more pronounced when the tariff rate reduction triggers a greater increase in imports and when the forecasts are likely to incur higher proprietary costs. Our findings are consistent with competition from existing rivals reducing voluntary disclosure through increased proprietary costs. 



Keywords: competition; disclosure; proprietary cost; tariff rate reduction

Bio

Biography
Ying Huang is a fifth year accounting PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. She holds a master in accounting from University of Illinois, and a master degree in finance and a bachelor degree in economics from Peking University. Before joining the PhD program, Ying worked as an auditor at Ernst & Young. She is a CPA (inactive) and a CFA charterholder. 

Ying is broadly interested in empirical archival research in accounting. Her main research area is corporate disclosure. She is particularly interested in how some under-explored stakeholders, such as politicians and customers, affect firms’ disclosure behaviors, and how corporate disclosure varies with industry structure. Ying also studies how institutional investors affect firms' financial reporting, tax, and audit.
