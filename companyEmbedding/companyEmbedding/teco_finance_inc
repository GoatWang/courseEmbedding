Rating Action: Moody's downgrades TECO Energy and Tampa Electric Company's ratings upon Emera acquisition close






                    Global Credit Research - 06 Jul 2016
                







Over $3 billion of rated debt affected


New York, July 06, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded the senior 
unsecured ratings of TECO Energy Inc. (TECO) and its financing 
subsidiary, TECO Finance, Inc. to Baa2 from Baa1; 
and the issuer and senior unsecured ratings of Tampa Electric Company 
(TEC) to A3 from A2. These rating actions conclude the review for 
downgrade that commenced on June 1, 2016 as a result of Emera Inc.'s 
(Emera, Baa3 stable) acquisition of TECO. Emera's acquisition 
of TECO closed on July 1, 2016. The rating outlooks for TECO, 
TECO Finance and TEC are stable.




"TECO's downgrade is primarily driven by the significant incremental 
debt issued across the Emera parent holding companies," said 
Jeff Cassella, Vice President -- Senior Analyst. "The 
downgrade also factors in the lack of any meaningful ring-fence 
type provisions designed to insulate TECO Energy or its principal utility 
subsidiary, Tampa Electric Company."






RATINGS RATIONALE




TECO's Baa2 senior unsecured rating is primarily driven by the solid 
credit quality of its principal subsidiary, TEC, which operates 
under Florida's highly supportive regulatory framework. The rating 
also reflects TECO's solid financial metrics and incorporates the 
modest cash flow and regulatory diversity provided by New Mexico Gas Company 
(not rated).


TECO's rating is heavily influenced by TEC's rating, but also 
reflects the roughly 30% ratio of TECO's holding company 
debt (issued at TECO Finance) as a percentage of the TECO family consolidated 
debt. TECO Finance's debt is guaranteed by TECO, therefore 
TECO Finance has the same rating.


Furthermore, Emera's holding company debt, which includes 
the effects of TECO's consolidated debt, produces a ratio 
of holding company debt to total consolidated debt approaching 50%. 
This capital structure leads to material structural subordination and 
wider rating notch differential even though the holding company is supported 
by a diversified group of operating subsidiaries. For calculation 
purposes, Moody's includes the debt at TECO Finance as holding 
company debt and includes the Maritime Link project debt financing in 
Emera's total consolidated debt.


Tampa Electric Company's A3 senior unsecured rating reflects Florida's 
highly supportive regulatory framework, which allows a suite of 
timely cost recovery mechanisms. These mechanisms provide more 
stable and consistent cash flows, which enable the utility to generate 
strong financial metrics. TEC's rating incorporates a view 
that the utility will earn close to its allowed ROEs of about 10% 
and maintain its ratio of CFO pre-W/C to debt in the mid-to-high 
20% range. TEC's rating is constrained by the significant 
amount of debt held at its parent company, TECO, as well as 
its ultimate parent, Emera.


Rating Outlook


TECO and TEC's stable rating outlooks reflect our expectation that 
the Florida regulatory jurisdiction remains supportive and provide timely 
recovery mechanisms for prudently incurred costs and investments. 
The stable outlook also incorporates our view that TECO and TEC's 
financial metrics will remain strong including TECO's CFO pre-W/C 
to debt in the mid-to-high teens and TEC's CFO pre-W/C 
to debt in the mid-to-high 20% range. The 
stable outlook also assumes that TECO or Emera will not materially increase 
their intermediate holding company or parent level debt further that could 
cause downwards rating pressure across the entire corporate family.


Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade


TECO's rating could be upgraded if TEC's rating was upgraded. 
In addition, TECO's rating could be upgraded if the debt levels 
at TECO and Emera were significantly reduced to where holding company 
debt was below 40% of consolidated debt on a sustained basis. 
Furthermore, the regulatory jurisdictions where TECO's utility 
subsidiaries operate need to remain credit supportive, particularly 
TEC's regulatory environment in Florida, and TECO's 
ratio of CFO pre-W/C to debt was sustained in the high teens range.


TEC's rating could be upgraded if the debt levels at TECO and Emera 
were significantly reduced to where holding company debt was below 40% 
of consolidated debt on a sustained basis. In addition to a reduction 
in holding company debt, the Florida regulatory environment needs 
to remain credit supportive and TEC's financial metrics were to remain 
strong including CFO pre-WC to debt in the high 20% range 
on a sustained basis.


Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade 


TECO's rating could be downgraded if TEC's rating was downgraded. 
In addition, a rating downgrade could occur if the company were 
to substantially increase its level of parent debt relative to consolidated 
debt; or if it were to invest in other non-core unregulated 
business. The rating would also experience downward pressure if 
there was a sustained deterioration in financial metrics, such as 
its ratio of CFO pre-W/C to debt were to decline below 15% 
on a sustained basis.


Furthermore, TECO and its subsidiaries' ratings could be downgraded 
if its ultimate parent, Emera were to increase its parent level 
debt or grow its non-regulated businesses such that the TECO family 
experiences further contagion risk.


TEC's rating could be downgraded if Florida's regulatory framework 
becomes less supportive such that regulatory lag increases or TEC's ability 
to recover its costs in a timely manner is negatively affected. 
Separately, TEC's ratings could be negatively affected if contagion 
risk exposure to its new parent, Emera or its affiliated businesses 
increases due to incremental leverage or additional unregulated business 
investments. In addition, a downgrade could occur if its 
financial metrics weakened such that CFO pre-W/C to debt were to 
decline to the low 20% range on a sustained basis.


TECO Energy, Inc. is an intermediate holding company whose 
principal subsidiary is Tampa Electric Company, a regulated electric 
and gas utility in Florida which composed 94% of TECO's operating 
earnings from continued operations in 2015. TEC's electric business, 
Tampa Electric, provides retail electric service to over 725,000 
customers in West Central Florida, while TEC's gas business, 
Peoples Gas System, serves over 365,000 customers in Florida's 
major metropolitan areas. TECO also owns New Mexico Gas Company, 
a natural gas local distribution company serving 520,000 primarily 
residential customers in New Mexico, which approximates 60% 
of the state's total population. TECO guarantees the approximately 
$1 billion of debt issued by its rated financing subsidiary arm, 
TECO Finance, Inc. TEC and PGS are regulated by the Florida 
Public Service Commission, while NMGC is regulated by the New Mexico 
Public Regulation Commission. On July 1, 2016, TECO 
Energy and its subsidiaries were acquired by Emera Inc. for an 
aggregate purchase price of approximately $10.4 billion, 
including the assumption of approximately $4.1 billion of 
debt.

Rating Action: Moody's assigns new Baa3 ratings to Emera Inc. and Emera US Finance LP; rating outlooks are stable; TECO Energy's ratings placed on review for downgrade






                    Global Credit Research - 01 Jun 2016
                







Approximately $10 billion of debt affected


New York, June 01, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service, (Moody's) assigned a new 
Baa3 issuer rating to Emera Inc. (Emera) and a Baa3 senior unsecured 
rating to Emera US Finance LP's new note issuance of up to $3.4 
billion. Moody's also assigned a Ba2 rating to Emera's 
unsecured subordinated notes of up to $1.2 billion due 2076. 
The rating outlooks of Emera and Emera US Finance are stable.




At the same time, Moody's placed the long-term ratings 
of TECO Energy and its subsidiaries on review for downgrade, including 
the Baa1 senior unsecured ratings of TECO Energy; the Baa1 senior 
unsecured rating of TECO Energy's financing subsidiary, TECO 
Finance, Inc.; and the A2 issuer and senior unsecured 
ratings of Tampa Electric Company.




Emera US Finance is a financing subsidiary of Emera and its senior unsecured 
notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and 
several basis, by Emera and Emera US Holdings Inc. (EUSHI, 
unrated), an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of Emera. 
As a result of the guarantee, Emera US Finance's rating is 
directly correlated to Emera's credit profile and rating. 
EUSHI does not have any operations and serves as the holding company of 
Emera's assets located in the United States, including Emera 
Maine and TECO Energy, Inc. upon acquisition close.




RATINGS RATIONALE




"Emera's Baa3 rating assumes the TECO Energy acquisition will 
close imminently, and reflects the company's diverse and largely 
regulated business risk profile, offset by very high consolidated 
leverage," said Jeff Cassella, Vice President -- 
Senior Analyst. "Concurrently, TECO and its subsidiaries' 
review for downgrade is prompted by Emera's significant use of debt 
to finance the acquisition, and the lack of meaningful ring-fence 
type provisions designed to insulate TECO's credit profile."






The review for downgrade at TECO Energy is likely to result in no more 
than a one-notch downgrade of TECO Energy and its subsidiaries' 
ratings on or about the time of the acquisition close. A one-notch 
downgrade across the TECO family will not have any material impact on 
Emera's newly assigned Baa3 rating, because Emera's 
Baa3 rating already incorporates the view of TECO Energy's weakened 
credit profile. The review will focus on the amount of incremental 
debt issued at the Emera parent level to finance the acquisition, 
the increased strategic importance of TECO Energy, particularly 
its principal operating subsidiary, Tampa Electric Company, 
to service the increased level of debt via upstream dividend payments 
within the Emera corporate family, and the lack of any meaningful 
ring-fence type provisions designed to insulate TECO Energy or 
Tampa Electric Company's credit profile from debt at its intermediate 
parent or that of Emera.




Emera's Baa3 rating reflects Emera's lower risk business profile 
that includes good geographic and regulatory diversity across its portfolio 
of operating subsidiaries. Emera's regulated subsidiaries 
are expected to account for approximately 90% of consolidated cash 
flows, a credit positive. However, Emera will be exposed 
to a high financial risk profile, evidenced by the significant level 
of consolidated debt, including debt to rate base of over 100%. 
These debt levels are a direct result of Emera's leveraged acquisition 
of TECO Energy, and we expect the leverage to weigh on Emera's 
pro-forma consolidated financial metrics over the next several 
years. That said, Emera's Baa3 rating incorporates 
a view that Emera's financial profile will improve over the next 
few years, such that Emera's pro-forma ratio of cash 
flow from operations pre-working capital (CFO pre-W/C) to 
debt will steadily improve to the mid-teen's range, 
from around 11% in 2016.




Furthermore, Emera's holding company debt as a percentage 
of total consolidated debt approaches 50%, which leads to 
material structural subordination considerations and points to a wider 
rating-notch differential between the ratings of Emera and its 
principal operating subsidiaries. For calculation purposes, 
we include the debt at TECO Energy's intermediate holding company 
as well as a proportion of the Maritime Link project debt as holding company 
debt in the calculation of holding company debt to total consolidated 
debt.




The Ba2 rating assigned to the subordinated hybrid notes is two notches 
below Emera's Baa3 senior unsecured rating as they are subordinated 
to substantially all of the company's other debt obligations. The 
notes have a long-dated maturity (60 years) and Emera can opt to 
defer coupons on a cumulative basis for up to five years. For further 
details, please refer to Moody's Cross Sector Rating Methodology 
"Hybrid Equity Credit" (March 2015).






Rating Outlook


Emera's stable rating outlook incorporates a view that Emera will 
successfully execute on its permanent financing plans to finance the TECO 
Energy acquisition in a consistent manner with what has been stated publicly. 
The stable outlook also reflects our expectation that Emera's consolidated 
financial metrics improve, such that consolidated CFO pre-W/C 
to debt approaches 14% over the next 3 years; that the regulatory 
jurisdictions that Emera's operating subsidiaries operate continue 
to remain credit supportive by providing timely recovery of prudently 
incurred costs and investments; that the construction and execution 
risks associated with the large Martime Link project will remain manageable, 
and will avoid material delays and cost over-runs, and; 
that EMERA will not undertake aggressive shareholder friendly debt financed 
activities that will be a detriment to the risk profile of the corporate 
family.




Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade


Given the significant amount of holding company debt at the Emera level, 
a rating upgrade in the near-to-intermediate term is unlikely. 
However, a rating upgrade could occur of holding company debt as 
a percentage of consolidated debt were to decline below 40% on 
a sustained basis and if consolidated metrics improved such that CFO pre-W/C 
to debt was sustained at or above the 15% level. 




Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade


Emera's rating could be downgraded if regulatory support of its 
operating utilities deteriorates; or business risk profile increases 
through investments in its non-regulated activities; or holding 
company debt increases further; or if financial metrics do not improve 
as expected and consolidated CFO pre-W/C to debt remains below 
12% on a sustained basis.




Headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Emera is a diversified 
utility and energy services holding company with approximately $12 
billion in assets and $2.79 billion in revenues in 2015. 
Upon closing of the TECO Energy acquisition, Emera will own regulated 
electric, gas, and transmission and distribution utilities 
in Nova Scotia, Maine, Florida, New Mexico and the Caribbean 
islands. The company also owns other regulated and non-regulated 
electric and gas assets in North America. Pro-forma for 
the TECO Energy acquisition approximately 85% of the company's 
earnings will be generated by rate-regulated businesses and Emera 
will have more than $27.6 billion in assets and more than 
$6.3 billion in revenues.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
