Returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75%.




The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Portfolio Positioning as of 03/31/2017

We are constructive on the U.S. economy’s growth prospects, and believe that the potential for changes in the corporate regulatory environment will provide tailwinds to many industries.
The portfolio remains overweight in the industrials and materials sectors, as the prospects for increased infrastructure spending should help support strong revenue growth in certain sub-industries.
The portfolio remains underweight in certain bond proxy sectors, such as utilities, consumer staples, and real estate, as we believe these sectors are extremely overvalued and may also be adversely affected by the normalization of interest rates.
The portfolio is overweight in the information technology sector due to continued innovation in e-commerce and cloud computing.
The portfolio is overweight in the financials sector, as we anticipate that favorable changes to the U.S. regulatory environment and a normalization of interest rates should benefit banks.

Market Capitalization Breakdown - Morningstar separates stock portfolio holdings into five market-capitalization groups: Giant, Large, Mid, Small, and Micro. Of the 5000 largest domestic stocks in their equities database, the top 1% are categorized as Giant, the next 4% are Large, the next 15% are Mid, the next 30% are Small, and the remaining 50% are Micro. Stocks outside of the largest 5000 are also classified as Micro.




 
Weighted Average Market Cap - The average market capitalization of all companies held in the portfolio with each company weighted according to its percent held in the portfolio. The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                




P/B Ratio - A ratio that helps determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. It is calculated by dividing a stock's price per share by its book value per share. The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               





P/E Ratio - Is the weighted average of each holding's P/E ratio (price of a stock divided by its earnings per share). The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                  




Portfolio Turnover - This is a measure of the Fund’s trading activity which is computed by taking the lesser of purchases or sales divided by average monthly market value, excluding short-term investments. The resulting percentage represents the percentage of the portfolio’s holdings that have changed over the past year.

The total base return displayed for the Fund does not capture daily cash flow and trading activity and therefore is subject to reasonable variance from the Fund's actual return. Please refer to the Fund's performance results for longer-term returns. The Fund is actively managed and portfolio characteristics, such as individual holdings and sector weightings, may change significantly over time.

About Wilshire Attribution
The Wilshire Atlas Variance Analysis tool provides a methodology for explaining the difference in performance between a portfolio and its benchmark, based on the decomposition of returns. The user specifies the portfolio, index, link frequency, sector and weighting. The weighting can be shown as beginning, average or end weights and is used for display purposes only. 
Average Weight (Portfolio): This is the average weight of each group in the portfolio. Alternatively, the weight at the end of the reporting period, or on average across the reporting period, may be selected.
Base Return (Portfolio): This is the weighted average holding period return for the securities in each group. This weighted average is calculated for each link period using beginning weights and then the resulting values are linked together to calculate the displayed value.
Average Weight (Benchmark): This is the average weight of each group in the benchmark. Alternatively, the weight at the end of the reporting period, or on average across the reporting period, may be selected.
Base Return (Benchmark): This is the weighted average holding period return for the benchmark securities in each group. This weighted average is calculated for each link period using beginning weights, then the resulting values are linked together to calculate the displayed value.
Stock Selection Variance: This is the success of selection decisions within each group versus the benchmark. It is calculated for each link period using the following equation: Stock Selection Variance = WP,G * (RP,G - RB,G), where WP,G = Weight of the group in the portfolio, RP,G = Return of the group in the portfolio, RB,G = Return of the group in the benchmark.
Group Weighting Variance: This is the result of weighting decisions in each group versus the benchmark. It is calculated for each link period using the following equation: Group Weighting Variance = (WP,G – WB,G) * (RB,G – RB,T), where WP,G = Weight of the group in the portfolio, WB,G = Weight of the group in the benchmark, RB,G = Return of the group in the benchmark, RB,T = Overall return of the benchmark.
Total Variance: This is the sum of group weighting and stock selection variances. This represents the amount of total variance that is explained by the selection and allocation decisions for each group.
Wilshire generated returns are calculated gross of fees based on end of day prices and do not capture intraday cash flow, price changes or trading activity, and therefore are subject to some variance from Lord Abbett returns. In addition, Wilshire and Lord Abbett may use different pricing sources and methodologies.
Not Classified securities represent those securities which have not been assigned an official GICS Direct classification. GICS Direct, a joint product of Standard & Poor’s and MSCI, provides industry classifications for more than 40,000 companies and over 45,000 securities. Not Classified securities may include, but are not limited to: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), pink sheet-listed issues, pre-IPO placements, private placements, secondary issues, open-end funds, closed-end funds, and non-operating establishments.
Under certain circumstances, Lord Abbett may elect to have Wilshire map an ETF holding to the relevant characteristics represented by that ETF’s underlying index in order to reflect the exposure and performance contributed by the ETF to the overall portfolio. When this option is selected, Wilshire will remove the ETF from the Not Classified category and instead allocate the ETF’s exposures across the relevant attributes based on the composition of the ETF’s underlying index.

For Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers Click here.



SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




A Note about Risk: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies, including market, liquidity, currency, and political risks. Small cap company stocks tend to be more volatile and may be less liquid than other types of stocks. Small cap companies may also have more limited product lines, markets, or financial resources and typically experience a higher risk of failure than large cap companies. Investments in growth companies can be more sensitive to the company's earnings and more volatile than the stock market in general. The Fund engages in active and frequent trading of its securities, which may result in increased transaction fees, reduced investment performance, and higher taxes. These factors can adversely affect Fund performance.
 




 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.   
 



The Russell 2000® Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 2000 companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values.



Indexes reflect total return, unless otherwise specified, with all dividends reinvested. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect the deduction of fees or expenses, and are not available for direct investment.
 
 
















Lipper Category Average - Peer group averages are based on universes of funds with the same investment objectives. The average return for the peer group is based on the returns of each individual fund within the group for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
 




Fund Expense Ratio Detail: Reflects expenses for the Fund's fiscal year-end and is subject to change. Fund expenses may fluctuate with market volatility. A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.




 
Lipper Category Average Expense Ratio reflects the average net expenses of Class A shares of all funds with in the peer group based on Lipper data available.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 599 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital through a diversified and actively managed portfolio consisting of developing growth companies, many of which are traded over the counter.




Strategy



To pursue its objective, the fund invests primarily in the equity securities of companies the portfolio management team believes demonstrate above-average, long-term growth potential. It invests at least 65% of its net assets in equity securities of small companies. The fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in foreign companies, including emerging market companies and American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs").


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 599 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital through a diversified and actively managed portfolio consisting of developing growth companies, many of which are traded over the counter.




Strategy



To pursue its objective, the fund invests primarily in the equity securities of companies the portfolio management team believes demonstrate above-average, long-term growth potential. It invests at least 65% of its net assets in equity securities of small companies. The fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in foreign companies, including emerging market companies and American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs").


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation.
Someone who is willing to accept the generally greater price volatility associated both with growth-oriented stocks and with smaller companies.

Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/30/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 10/10/1973, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/30/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 10/10/1973, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
5. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
6. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/30/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 10/10/1973, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
7. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
8. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
