FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in which WES is fully consolidated, which are included under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  We were formed by Anadarko in September 2012 by converting WGR Holdings, LLC into an MLP and changing its name to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP. We closed our IPO in December 2012 and own WES GP and a significant limited partner interest in WES, a growth-oriented Delaware MLP formed by Anadarko to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream energy assets. Our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated financial results of WES due to our 100% ownership interest in WES GP and WES GP's control of WES. Our only cash-generating assets consist of our partnership interests in WES, and we currently have no independent operations.   Owned and Operated Non-Operated Equity Operated Interests Interests Interests Gathering systems 11 4 5 2 Treating facilities 12 12 - 3 Natural gas processing plants/trains 20 5 - 2 NGL pipelines 2 - - 3 Natural gas pipelines 5 - - - Oil pipelines - 1 - 1  Table of Contents  Significant financial and operational events during the year ended December 31, 2016, included the following:   We raised our distribution to $0.46250 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a 3% increase over the distribution for the third quarter of 2016 and a 15% increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015. WES completed the acquisition of Springfield from Anadarko for cash and WES common unit consideration totaling $750.0 million. See Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K for additional information. WES issued 21,922,831 Series A Preferred units to private investors, generating net proceeds of $686.9 million, a portion of which was used to fund the acquisition of Springfield. See Equity Offerings under Part I, Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K for additional information. WES completed the offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes in July 2016 and an offering of an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2044 Notes in October 2016. Net proceeds were used to repay amounts then outstanding under the WES RCF and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. See Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Item 7 for additional information. WES commenced operation of Trains IV and V at the DBM complex in May 2016 and October 2016, respectively. Both are 200 MMcf/d processing plants. Further, after sustaining damage during the December 3, 2015, incident at the DBM complex, Train II (with capacity of 100 MMcf/d) returned to service in December 2016 and Train III (with capacity of 200 MMcf/d) returned to service in May 2016. WES received $33.8 million in cash proceeds from insurers related to the incident at the DBM complex, including $16.3 million for business interruption insurance claims and $17.5 million for property insurance claims. See Items Affecting the Comparability of Financial Results within this Item 7 for additional information. WES raised its distribution to $0.860 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a 2% increase over the distribution for the third quarter of 2016 and an 8% increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets totaled 3,940 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 5% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Throughput for crude/NGL assets totaled 184 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 1% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. WES's operating income (loss) was $708.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 350% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted gross margin attributable to WES for natural gas assets (as defined under the caption How WES Evaluates Its Operations within this Item 7) averaged $0.83 per Mcf for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 12% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets (as defined under the caption How WES Evaluates Its Operations within this Item 7) averaged $2.11 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 9% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  Table of Contents  WES'S OPERATIONS  WES's results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil WES services through its systems. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 68% of total revenues and 47% of throughput (excluding equity investment throughput) were attributable to transactions with Anadarko. WES also recognized capital contributions from Anadarko of $45.8 million related to the above-market component of its commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko (see Note 5-Transactions with Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). WES receives significant dedications from its largest customer, Anadarko. With respect to WES's Wattenberg, Haley, Helper and Clawson gathering systems, Anadarko has made dedications to WES that will continue to expand as long as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems.  Table of Contents  HOW WES EVALUATES ITS OPERATIONS  WES's management relies on certain financial and operational metrics to analyze its performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing WES's operating results and profitability and include (1) throughput, (2) operating and maintenance expenses, (3) general and administrative expenses, (4) Adjusted gross margin (as defined below), (5) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) and  Throughput. Throughput is an essential operating variable WES uses in assessing its ability to generate revenues. In order to maintain or increase throughput on WES's gathering and processing systems, WES must connect additional wells to its systems. WES's success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by the successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to WES's systems, recompletions of existing wells connected to its systems, its ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on non-dedicated acreage and its ability to attract natural gas, NGL or crude oil volumes currently serviced by its competitors. During the year ended December 31, 2016, WES added 226 receipt points to its systems.  Operating and maintenance expenses. WES monitors operating and maintenance expenses to assess the impact of such costs on the profitability of its assets and to evaluate the overall efficiency of its operations. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, field labor, insurance, repair and maintenance, equipment rentals, contract services, utility costs and services provided to WES or on its behalf. For periods commencing on the date of and subsequent to WES's acquisition of its assets, certain of these expenses are incurred under and governed by WES's services and secondment agreement with Anadarko.  General and administrative expenses. To help ensure the appropriateness of WES's general and administrative expenses and maximize its cash available for distribution, WES monitors such expenses through comparison to prior periods, to the annual budget approved by WES GP's Board of Directors, as well as to general and administrative expenses incurred by similar midstream companies. Pursuant to the WES omnibus agreement, Anadarko and WES GP perform centralized corporate functions for WES. General and administrative expenses for periods prior to WES's acquisition of the WES assets include costs allocated by Anadarko in the form of a management services fee, which approximated the general and administrative costs incurred by Anadarko attributable to the WES assets. For periods subsequent to the acquisition of the WES assets, Anadarko is no longer compensated for corporate services through a management services fee. Instead, allocations and reimbursements of general and administrative expenses are determined by Anadarko in its reasonable discretion, in accordance with WES's partnership agreement and the WES omnibus agreement. Amounts required to be reimbursed to Anadarko under WES's omnibus agreement also include those expenses attributable to its status as a publicly traded partnership, such as the following:   expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting;   tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution expenses;   expenses associated with listing on the NYSE; and   independent auditor fees, legal expenses, investor relations expenses, director fees, and registrar and transfer agent fees.  See further detail in Note 5-Transactions with Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Table of Contents  Non-GAAP financial measures  Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP. WES defines Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ("Adjusted gross margin") as total revenues and other, less cost of product and reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue, plus distributions from equity investments and excluding the noncontrolling interest owner's proportionate share of revenue and cost of product. WES believes Adjusted gross margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of its operations, as well as its operating performance as compared to that of other companies in the industry. Cost of product expenses include (i) costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and NGLs pursuant to WES's percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole processing contracts, (ii) costs associated with the valuation of WES's gas imbalances, and (iii) costs associated with WES's obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers, which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by WES and sold to third parties. These expenses are subject to variability, although a majority of WES's exposure to commodity price risk inherent in its percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts is mitigated through its commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko. For a discussion of commodity price swap agreements, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A and Note 5-Transactions with Affiliates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. To facilitate investor and industry analyst comparisons between WES and its peers, WES also discloses Adjusted gross margin per Mcf attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets and Adjusted gross margin per Bbl for crude/NGL assets. See Key Performance Metrics within this Item 7.  Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP. WES defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ("Adjusted EBITDA") as net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, plus distributions from equity investments, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments, and other expense (including lower of cost or market inventory adjustments recorded in cost of product), less gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net, income from equity investments, interest income, income tax benefit, and other income. WES believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that WES's management and external users of WES's consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following, among other measures:   WES's operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;   the ability of WES's assets to generate cash flow to make distributions; and   the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.  Distributable cash flow. WES defines "Distributable cash flow" as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under WES's commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes. WES compares Distributable cash flow to the cash distributions WES expects to pay its unitholders. Using this measure, WES's management can quickly compute the Coverage ratio of distributable cash flow to planned cash distributions. WES believes Distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies, analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate WES's operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The second-quarter 2017 Coverage ratio(1) of 1.19 times was based on the quarterly distribution of $0.890 per unit."We continue to achieve significant milestones in the Delaware Basin that enhance both our competitive position in the area and our ability to serve the increasing needs of producers. These include the DBJV-for-Marcellus asset exchange, the early settlement of the DBJV Deferred Purchase Price Obligation, and the successful start-up of our produced water gathering and disposal systems," said Chief Executive Officer, Benjamin Fink. "Additionally, we are excited to announce the sanctioning of the Latham plant in the DJ Basin, which will consist of two cryogenic processing trains with a total capacity of 400 MMcf/d.

VandenBrandDirector, Investor Relationsjon.vandenbrand@anadarko.com832.636.6000Western Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP MeasuresBelow are reconciliations of (i) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) to WES's Distributable cash flow (non-GAAP), (ii) net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP (GAAP) and net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ("Adjusted EBITDA") (non-GAAP), and (iii) operating income (loss) (GAAP) to Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ("Adjusted gross margin") (non-GAAP), as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes that WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, and Coverage ratio are widely accepted financial indicators of WES's financial performance compared to other publicly traded partnerships and are useful in assessing its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio, as defined by WES, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, WES's Distributable cash flow, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin and Coverage ratio should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and other applicable performance measures, such as operating income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.Western Gas Partners, LP Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures, continuedDistributable Cash FlowWES defines Distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under WES's commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes.
