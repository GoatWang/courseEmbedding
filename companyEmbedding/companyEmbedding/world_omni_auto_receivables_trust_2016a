NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2016-A (WOART 2016-A):
    

      --$152,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$352,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$262,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74,800,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,030,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Weaker Credit Quality: The 2016-A pool has weaker collateral credit 
      quality compared with recent transactions. The WA FICO score has 
      decreased to 722, the lowest level since 2008-B. New vehicles total 
      94.5% and the pool is geographically concentrated in the southeast, 
      consistent with historical World Omni originations.
    

      High Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms 
      greater than 60 months total 80.3% in 2016-A, the highest to date. 
      Extended-term loans have historically produced higher loss rates. 
      Mitigating this somewhat is that borrowers within this segment have 
      strong obligor FICO scores. Fitch accounted for this risk in its 
      determination of the loss proxy.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: CE in 2016-A is consistent 
      with prior transactions, with 4.55% hard CE for the class A notes, 2.50% 
      hard CE for the class B notes, and 3.56% of annual excess spread (up 
      from 3.53% in 2015-B). The structure is able to support the respective 
      multiples of Fitch's base case loss expectation of 2.25%, commensurate 
      with the final ratings.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and 
      securitizations have experienced increases in delinquency and net loss 
      performance in the 2013-2015 vintages, although they remain below peak 
      levels.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni 
      to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for 2016-A as 
      evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2016-A to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. The 
      sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for 
      both classes of notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP (EY). The third-party due diligence focused on an extract of 
      131 retail instalment sale contracts that were selected by EY and 
      verified for details such as customer name and state, interest rate, 
      monthly payment amount, original term, FICO, etc. In that sample set all 
      compared information was in agreement. Fitch considered this information 
      in its analysis and concluded that the findings do not impact our 
      analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in 
      connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link 
      contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in: 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust, Series 
      2016-A Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the 
      asset class as detailed in Fitch's March 3, 2016 special report: 
      --'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

New vehicles declined to 89.6% in 2016-B from 94.5% in 2016-A, the lowest level since 2012-B.High Percentage of Extended-Term Loans: Loans with original terms greater than 60 months total 81.1% in 2016-B, the highest to date in a WOART pool. Extended-term loans have historically produced higher loss rates. Fitch accounted for this risk in its determination of the loss proxy.Higher Credit Enhancement (CE): Class A hard CE in 2016-B totals 5.20%, up 65 bps versus 2016-A and prior 2012-2015 transactions. Class B hard CE is 2.50%, unchanged from 2016-A while annual excess spread is 3.62%. The structure is able to support the respective multiples of Fitch's 2.40% base case loss proxy, commensurate with the expected ratings.Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: World Omni's portfolio and securitizations have experienced increases in delinquency and net loss performance in the 2013 to 2015 vintages, although they remain below peak levels.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes World Omni to be a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for this series as evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. The sensitivity analysis shows a potential downgrade of one category for both classes of notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP (EY). The third-party due diligence focused on an extract of 135 retail instalment sale contracts that were selected by EY and verified for details such as customer name and state, interest rate, monthly payment amount, original term, and FICO. In that sample set, all compared information was in agreement. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and concluded that the findings do not affect our analysis. A copy of the ASB Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSA description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below.
