CUTLER, WILLIAM F William F. Cutler, aged 89, of Middleville, died peacefully in his home on August 23, 2012 with his family at his side. He was preceded in death by his wife, Bev in 1994; his sister, Harriet; and brothers, Hank, Robert and Dick. Bill was a man of character with a quick wit, an infectious laugh and generous ways. He was the father you wished you had! He was born in Benton Harbor, Michigan on September 6, 1922 and grew up in Three Oaks, the fifth child of Henry and Alice Cutler. Bill attended Kalamazoo College and proudly served his country as a United States Marine from 1942-1946. In 1946 he married Beverly Heckathorn and they were involved and loving parents. In 1950, Bill, his brother and his father founded the H.H. Cutler Company, a maker of infant and children's wear in Grand Rapids. He served as Vice President of Sales and Chairman of the Board until the company was sold to V.F. Corp in 1994. Bill was an outdoorsman who had a lifetime love of farming and hunting. He had many special memories of his time in South Dakota and the friends he made and spent time with there. After Bev's death in 1994 he met Joan Brenner through his sister Harriet and they married in 1997. Together they established "Cutler's Little Farm" and raised quality cattle. They enjoyed going to cattle shows and were well respected in the industry. Bill will be greatly missed by his wife, Joan; children, Bill (Trish) Cutler, Barry (Renie) Cutler, Barb Cutler, Brian (Maureen) Cutler and Larry Van Haecke; nine grandchildren, Ryan (Carly Guist) Cutler, Kristin (Peter) Marinoff, Sean (Brecken) Cutler, Ashley Cutler, Liz Cutler, Jaime (Tom) Weibel, Kaitlin (Chris) Silliven, Linsey (Ben) Cahill, Brian Cutler, Jr; eight great grandchildren; his sister, Helen Wood; in-laws, Marian Cutler, Marge (John) Appello, Barbara and Tom Green, Tom Rogge and many nephews and nieces and special friends. Thank-you... Dad/ Grandpa/ Great Grandpa for the good life you have given us all. In lieu of flowers consider donations to Hospice of Michigan. Please join the family in celebrating a life well-lived, on Dad's 90th birthday, Thursday, September 6, at Cascade Country Club, 5:00-8:00 p.m.
