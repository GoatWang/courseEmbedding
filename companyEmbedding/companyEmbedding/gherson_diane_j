HR Disrupted
IBM's CHRO shares her view of the next agenda for delivering
value.
By Diane J. Gherson
Monday, June 8, 2015













The following is a selected essay appearing in The Rise
of HR: Wisdom from 73 Thought Leaders.
It isn't often that a group of professionals can say with
confidence that they stand at an important moment in history. This is one such
moment for HR. 
If that sounds like overreach, step back and consider the moment
in which we find ourselves today. Over the past decade, we have seen the
convergence of three historic shifts that are reshaping business and
technology.
* Data -- The volume, velocity and variety of data and analytics
provide more granular and customized information about, not just past patterns
and trends, but inferences from the "big data" created by the
Internet revolution and predictions about the future. Analytics change how we
do work and make decisions. Predictive analytics have led to prescriptive
analytics and have reshaped entire industries, as Netflix has done in home
entertainment.
* Cloud -- This is not just a source of greater productivity, but
the basis for fundamentally new business models. Information (movies,
high-school term papers, etc.) can now be managed and stored "as a
service," without the need for on-premise servers and licensed
applications. Now, people outside the IT department can access sophisticated
tools and applications on a pay-as-you-go basis. This allows for much more
flexibility, mobility and agility in managing information.
* Social engagement on mobile platforms -- Individuals are now
interacting with institutions in new ways, reframing their relationships.
Physical locations matter less than social connections. Facebook-type
technologies inside the enterprise have allowed people to share and build on
one another's ideas, data and work products, creating a richer dialogue and
workspace than ever before (and certainly a step change from email). And
because of the feedback loops created by mobile platforms, "users"
have become "collaborators."
Any one of these forces would have been enough to usher in a new
era of technology. Together, they are redefining the agenda of global business.
And these technology trends are reshaping HR. For example, we can
now buy HR software and HRIS as a service on the cloud, instead of investing in
costly and inflexible on-premise systems. We now make people-related decisions
and compensation or training investments through advanced analytics rather than
standardized processes or benchmarking. We now serve up more and more of our
programs -- from learning to healthcare enrollment -- on mobile devices. We use
social chat features to enhance management development or respond to issues.
And we find ourselves managing a litany of new business controls to ensure
protection of personal and confidential data.
At the same time, these trends are radically reshaping
expectations of what HR can and should deliver -- both in terms of HR services
and in terms of strategic impact. 
What will HR services look like when we focus on user experience
in the era of cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security technologies?
Certainly, the recruitment function is leading the way, with a shift to passive
recruiting using Google+, Instagram, Xing (Europe), WeChat (China), Weibo
(China), RenRen (China) and YouTube -- as well as through online contests,
video interviews and integrating the candidate experience on smartphones. 
But while advancements in recruiting offer a glimpse into the
future, by and large, the rest of HR services still feel less like Zappos and more
like the Internal Revenue Service. So how can we modernize our approach? I
believe there are two main areas that will have a disproportionate influence on
the future of our profession -- analytics and engagement.
Importance of HR Analytics
There was a time when HR advice relied heavily on benchmarking. We
would ask, "What do most/other successful companies do?" Today, with
analytics, we can mine huge amounts of data and offer more granular, customized
solutions, including more flexible responses. Using outcome data such as
revenues, productivity, hiring yield, individual performance or employee
engagement, we can help our leaders understand the probability of success of
certain decisions. 
For years, we have struggled with sales incentives and tried to create
norms and rules for how incentives would change people's behaviors. With modern
analytics, we can define more accurately which incentives work with each
employee and for which assignment. We can also define the extent to which goals
should be "stretch" versus doable, and we can change goals depending
on the situation.
At IBM, analytics now enable us to predict an employee's
propensity to leave. In fact, several of our HR employees have obtained a U.S.
patent for our proactive retention algorithms. Each year, we run proactive
retention programs whereby we increase the salaries of employees with a high
propensity to leave. This program has resulted in net savings of $131 million,
with savings measured as the avoided cost of hiring a replacement, net of the
investment to retain the employees. Using control groups, we have validated the
"propensity to leave" calculation within less than one point of
attrition. 
With the availability of social engagement and analytics, HR
programs have moved from annual events to ongoing works in progress. For
example, at IBM, we recently rolled out a recognition program in which 57
percent of recipients were very satisfied or satisfied. Our vendor informed us
this compared favorably to the industry average of 40 percent in the first year
of implementation -- but is this really acceptable? We were able to quickly ask
those who were not satisfied how we might modify the recognition program to
better meet their needs. We now have a granular understanding of what kind of
recognition has the highest impact on different populations. 
Social analytics also give us advance warnings of what might be
happening among our employees. We monitor blog posts about the company by
employees and others. While respecting privacy, we can gauge positive, neutral
or negative trends from social media. In some emerging markets, we have been
able to anticipate labor unrest and respond before the external activists'
interactions resulted in disruptive actions. 
Another strategic use of analytics is workforce management,
whereby headcount management has given way to skills management. Skills -- including
depth of skill -- have become an important currency in flatter, more fluid
organizations, and there is an increasing need for real-time assessment of skills
gaps and redundancies. Analytics can be used to infer employee expertise from
the vast data sources inside companies -- blogs, publications, resumes,
projects and so on. 
Because skills are changing so rapidly in technology, skills
inventories are hard and complex to keep up to date. At IBM, we developed an
app to find employees with specific expertise, anywhere in the world. The
search returns each expert's areas of expertise, organizational chart, common
connections and smartphone contact information. This is now being used at an
enterprise level for workforce planning, such as to identify gaps in "hot"
skills for recruitment and training investments. It is also used with inference
analytics to match redundant or under-employed employees with job openings and
projects that could use their skills. 
HR professionals need to develop analytics capabilities. Hard as
it is to imagine, there was a time only 30 years ago when professionals
believed that typing proficiency was not a necessary skill. I believe we are
now in the same situation with analytics. HR professionals have rich data at
their fingertips, and tools to undertake predictive and prescriptive analytics.
It won't be long before analytics departments go the way of typing pools. 
HR Process to Employee Experiences
And all this is happening at a time when our employees are
experiencing a revolution in their consumer experience outside of work. With
the move to mobile access and social technology, employees experience
organizations differently than in the past, and their bar is much higher. Their
experience on retail platforms has taught them to expect a high level of
personalization, feedback, transparency and adaptation in real time. They want
all systems to know them, they want to participate in the design and
improvement of programs that affect them, and they want to be able to give
feedback or ask questions in the moment and get a response within 30 minutes.

How do our HR systems and programs do against these expectations?
For the past two decades, HR has been all about process efficiency -- standardization,
outsourcing, globalization and manager self-service -- all so HR professionals
could focus on more strategic issues. The unhappy byproduct of this era is the
employee experience. While each of our processes --  compensation, recognition,
global mobility, benefits, internal transfers and so on -- became more
streamlined and more efficient, we outsourced the coordination across these
silos to the manager and the employee. While we may be more efficient than ever
before, the experience we deliver comes up short compared to what our employees
experience every day on retail platforms. 
For example, a new employee needs to get a laptop from IT, a badge
from security, office space from administrative services, benefits and payroll
paperwork from compensation, onboarding from learning and a welcome from her
manager. We need to offer employees a customized and integrated onboarding
experience, including a chance to socialize with other new hires and share questions
and answers. The same can be said of employee separations, which often generate
a painfully complex array of disparate tasks for the manager. 
And this brings us to the real potential of combining analytics
and employee experience. We will be able to anticipate what employees may need.
Using agile methods, HR professionals will operate less as subject-matter
experts and more as custodians of the employee and manager experience. 
No matter how you come at this, the answer isn't to extend
existing HR practices. It's completely reimagining how our work is done, how
processes run and how we integrate the core of the enterprise with the
capabilities of individual professionals. When we do these things in HR, we can
create a workplace that is more effective for our people, and one where they
feel like they matter -- and have a say in the things that matter to them.
I am an optimist about the future of our profession. For years (or
even decades), HR has sought to make an impact. Technological advances are once
again enabling HR to shift to higher ground, just as we shifted from personnel
to human resources years ago. Today, it's about how we capture the incredible
wealth of data and insight about talent that will shape a company's future.
Talent is the center of everything we do. To compete in new industries, we have
to create an environment that builds talent -- with people who can learn,
adapt, lead and innovate in a workplace that is interactive and transparent.
HR, with a focus on analytics and employee engagement, becomes the
transformative force to shape the future of the enterprise.

Selected
Essays From The Rise of HR
Effective
HR professionals have unique opportunities to add enormous value to business
success through insights on talent, leadership and organization.
To
comprehend and create HR's future, the HR Certification Institute in Washington
used the wisdom of crowds logic and invited HR thought leaders to share their
answers to a relatively simple question: What do HR professionals need to know
or do to be effective in today's and tomorrow's business world?
The
result of this quest is an unprecedented book edited by Dave Ulrich, William
Schiemann and Libby Sartain, The Rise of HR, in which 73 HR thought leaders
from industry, academia, consulting, associations and government put aside
commercial and competitive interests to offer global, collaborative and
innovate perspectives on the future of HR. Featured this month is a selected
essay from that volume that was modified from the e-book.

Diane joined IBM as the vice president, Compensation and Benefits for the corporation. In this position, she refreshed and transformed the $30B compensation and benefits portfolio to drive substantial value for the enterprise.

Her 2015 essay "HR Disrupted: The Next Agenda for Transformation and Delivering Value" was featured in The Rise of HR: Wisdom from 73 Thought Leaders,an anthology of essays on critical issues facing business and talent professionals. In 2013, Diane was awarded a U.S. patent in the field of predictive analytics. Diane serves on the board of directors of both the HR Policy Association and the American Health Policy Institute.
Prior to IBM, Diane was a partner with consulting firm Towers Watson, overseeing the global employee and performance management compensation practice.
Diane earned a Bachelor of Arts with honours from Trinity College, University of Toronto, and a Masters degree in Industrial and Labor Relations from Cornell University. While she chose not to complete the degree, she also attended MIT as a PhD candidate at the Sloan School of Management. Diane lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and is married with two children.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
