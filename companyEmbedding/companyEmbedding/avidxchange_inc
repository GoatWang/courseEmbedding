What is AP Automation?
Accounts Payable (AP) Automation is the bridge for AP from the past to the present. AP Automation reduces the paper in the AP process, which in turn eliminates the outdated, manual processes that make companies susceptible to fraud, late payments, missing invoices, and painful audits.
When your company is automated, all of your invoice and payment information lives in the secure cloud. This enables you to access information 24/7 from anywhere that you have an internet connection. We live in a world where we’re always on the go, and can access everything from our smart phones. So, why should AP be any different?

Learn More











“My personal reason to automate was going green, but my motivation for our company was to have all of our information in one place. We have 10 different accounting systems that we have our financial information in, so having everything in one place is absolutely invaluable, especially during an audit.”

Nicole Claret, Director of Cash Management
National Development

It helps manage all employees' accountability on what invoices are being paid compared to the work that is being done at one of our corporate campuses or commercial properties. It has helped organize invoices by property and has helped us pay each invoice correctly by entity.ProsGreat organizational tool.Able to pay invoices right from the site.Has a wide variety of reports that can be utilized.ConsSetting up users and new entities.A training on reports and which are the best to use.Likelihood to Recommend10.0AvidXchange can be used in all situations where an organization needs to pay a wide variety of invoices and needs its employees to sign in and approve what should be paid. There is no situation where an employee shouldn't go in to look at invoices or work that was ordered and needs review before payment.from John Dunn's Full Review Suzanne CrockettOperations and Marketing Specialist | Commercial Real Estate | 11-50 employees"AvidXchange Review"8 of 10  |  6/26/2017Invited By: Vendor | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe currently utilize AvidXchange for the processing and payment of invoices for all of our managed properties as well as our company entity. AvidXchange is utilized by 80% of the employees at our company, mostly through the approval workflow function. It has helped tremendously in the automation of our AP process.ProsAutomation: Every part of Avid's process is automated through the use of workflows established by the AvidXchange administrator. This allows all vested entities to review and approve the payment of an invoice in a timely manner.Transparency: As an invoice goes through the review and approval process, every step is documented and available for review. This ensures all parties are appropriately vested in ensuring the timely approval of invoices for paymentAccuracy: Automating the AP process has helped to minimize the risk for errors that occur through manual invoice entry and approval.ConsAvidPay needs some improvement to minimize the amount of time it takes to issue payment for invoicesThe search features within AvidXchange on the advanced search screen sometimes do not function correctly (sorting by ascending / descending order doesn't work all of the time).The log enhancement follow-up procedure could use some work.Likelihood to Recommend8.0Companies struggling through a manual AP process with a high volume of invoices received every month should consider AvidXchange. They would benefit by freeing up the time and effort of accounting employees, who may then have the time to focus on other duties.  Companies with minimal invoices wouldn't be a good fit.  The system works best with high invoice volumes.from Suzanne Crockett's Full Review (2 More Sections)Nancy TricolaAcct's Payable-Receiveable, Data Systems Management | Real Estate | 11-50 employeesUser Review: "Activate AvidXchange"9 of 10  |  6/1/2017Invited By: Vendor | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeAvidXchange is used by all my department managers. We were having a severe issue with invoices being lost on peoples' desks and/or late payments due to the old system. AvidXchange has completely eliminated these issues.ProsThe best feature for me is the history tab. I know how long it has been in the system and who has touched or viewed it. If there is a query from a vendor on a specific invoice the history tab can answer that question. If it is in dispute or if there is a wrong amount you can answer the vendor question without having to hunt down the others involved.If there is an urgent invoice I can scan and push it through avid invoice without waiting for it to be processed by AvidXchange.It communicates well with other systems. If I make a correction to or add a vendor to my MRI system the avidsync will pick that up and update AvidXchange as well and vice versa. I only have to worry about entering the information once into one system.ConsI really wish there was a way for AvidXchange indexers to "get to know" the companies they index for. The indexing policies are such that it leaves little room for common sense and I do a fair share of correcting workflows and such.Likelihood to Recommend9.0I really like that AvidXchange saves me a lot of time. I am no longer spending 2+ hours a couple of days a week manually entering invoices. I can tell a vendor exactly where their invoice is at any given time through the process. It also makes it easier to locate payment information. I only have to go to one system now instead of two.from Nancy Tricola's Full Review (2 More Sections)Shawna Guajardo-VickersAccounting Assistant | Restaurants | 1001-5000 employeesAvidXchange Review: "The Perfect Solution"10 of 10  |  4/28/2017Invited By: Vendor | Incentive: NoUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use AvidXchange through our corporate office and five corporate locations. AvidXchange provides transparency; it provides our security for all approval processes at all levels. It's a perfect solution for our accounting need at year end audit.ProsIt's amazing. You can be an owner of multiple companies and have all the invoices paid from one solution, and it's all online and at your fingertips.Set up each company with their own bank account code the expense, review the invoice and send it for approval.Transparency. The approval process it set up at all levels. So you can have a first coded - then the department or manager that oversaw the work approve - then the final release of payment the accounting looking at the bank balance. You can set up at a certain dollar amount to receive a second or third approval if your company has partners or Board members.I have nine (9) different locations and global vendors in our set up. If I did not have AvidXchange, a day of check cutting [is what] I would need for each location and that is what I would do all week long. This is a click of the button, an approval process, a complete assembly line that works perfect and a massive time saver so I spend one hour a day on this.ConsCredit Memos needs to be a better function. Currently this function does not work properly and pulls over into our accounting software Intacct.Likelihood to Recommend10.0AvidXchange is the best payable system out there for any multi-unit owner, or a management company. I've been using it since 2010 and cannot imagine my accounting life without it. It is online, has an approval process, has transparency; a complete time saver and organizer between all your businesses.from Shawna Guajardo-Vickers's Full Review (2 More Sections)Brian MurphyDirector of JD Edwards Business Services | Hospitality | 5001-10,000 employeesUser Review: "AvidXchange a Move Towards the Future"9 of 10  |  4/4/2017Invited By: Vendor | Incentive: NoUse Cases and Deployment ScopeAvidXchange is used throughout our whole organization. With approximately 170 locations we had issues with losing approved invoices from the locations and processing the invoice images/attachments for our locations to review. With AvidXchange the image is the 1st step in the process and approval is done online where it can be reviewed by whoever needs to review. Our whole AP Department is now used to manage the invoices versus just being someone who keyed the invoice into our system.ProsAvidXchange tracks the history of an invoice with their History Tab and allows for management to review how the invoice was processed through approval.Workflows within AvidXchange allows for invoices to be routed easily for approval.Utilizing AvidPay frees up our AP Department from spending all Friday afternoon folding, stuffing and stamping the payments to be mailed out each week.ConsAvidXchange does not have a mobile app or full functionality on mobile phones or iPads. This would be a great tool for the customers.AvidXchange at times is too quick to want to refund payments not taken by a vendor versus doing detailed research as to why they won't accept a payment from their customer.I feel the reporting tab should be allowed to be given to users by report or sections of reports. Currently it is all or nothing.Likelihood to Recommend9.0AvidXchange is well suited for companies with multiple locations where approvals may be hard to get directly.  A user can log on when they have time basically from anywhere to review, code and approve invoices.  This would allow for processing of invoices centrally more efficiently then with appear invoices being moved from one place to another to be processed. from Brian Murphy's Full Review (3 More Sections)Richard Maritt, CMCA, AMSDirector of Training and Development | Real Estate | 201-500 employeesAvidXchange Review: "A Solid A/P Business Partner!"9 of 10  |  4/3/2017Invited By: Vendor | Incentive: NoUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use AvidXchange throughout our entire organization. The invoices for 770 managed entities (homeowner and condo associates) are handled in it by 150 managers. It has allowed for remote invoice entry, quicker turnaround of invoice receipt to payment issuance, and a reduction in our mailroom workforce. Archiving of invoices and their remote access has been a huge advantage for us.ProsInvoice creation/upload is simple for users needing immediate/quick entry/creation.Invoice assignment from one entity to another is quick and easy for administrators. Users can do so easily if it is a switch within their own portfolio to which they have access.Payment options offered to vendors are numerous. It is nice we can provide them with options.ConsAvidXchange is too aggressive after payments are sent to vendors in their approach to getting the vendors to sign up for a virtual credit card payment. Some of our vendors have complained at how frequently or diligently they were were pursued by AvidXchange.When an invoice approver is to become unavailable temporarily due to vacation, illness, etc., they should be able to auto-assign a covering party for a determined length of time or through a particular date like our previous system did. There is no good way for this to be handled by AvidXchange.Likelihood to Recommend9.0It is well suited for a company like ours with three primary offices and an additional 50 satellite offices.  It provides a way for things to be centralized with uniform access to information and processing.  As well, the processes and communication remain consistent when you are working with a company of this scale as they do not experience hiccups when a single staff member may be out for vacation, sick, or due to a staffing shortage.  Things just continue on as expected.from Richard Maritt, CMCA, AMS's Full Review (3 More Sections)Christina Honthy-LittleSenior Property Manager | Real Estate | 10,001+ employeesReview: "Using AvidXChange for Multi-Property Portfolios is a No-Brainer!"9 of 10  |  2/3/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI’ve been using AvidXchange for over ten years and couldn’t imagine doing my job without it.As a property manager with 32 sites, digitizing the accounts payable process is a necessity. Processing approximately 1600 invoices every 90 days, record keeping can be harrowing. Gone are the days of being handed folders of invoices to approve against a stapled stack of G/L account codes. All I have to do is login from any computer and AvidXchange provides a seamless system for tracking and approving our property invoices. The software integrates with our MRI accounting system, allowing for easy upload. We can assign workflow approval levels to differentiate between general OPEX and Capital Expenditures. As such, invoices that require owner/client approval can be streamlined with added comments. Most importantly, for construction or large tenant improvements, we can attach pertinent contract information to the invoice.ProsOur contractors and vendors can submit invoices electronically through AvidBill, removing the tedious task of sorting and coding mail. This feature saves on time and administrative duties.Communication is key, and being able to log a comment or question in AvidInvoice allows for clarification and expedited approval process.Having multiple properties, having the Property Code and % Allocation features allow us to ensure the correct entity is charged it's portion of expenses. For example, we may have a service that is coded to all 32 properties. With AvidInvoice we are able to allocate each entity's pro rata share of the invoice.ConsSearching for invoices: Because of the number of properties we have, AvidBill automatically codes an invoice internally to one property, but we may find upon review that it is really for a different property. When we search for an invoice, it won't show as the corrected Property ID, rather the first one entered.Vendor Names: I know this is a matter of human data entry, but oftentimes there are multiple vendors with the same name entered. The system may not grab the one that is intended for our company.Likelihood to Recommend9.0AvidXchange is certainly well suited for our commercial real estate business. When deciding on an accounts payable software, it is important to you ask how easily it integrates with your current accounting system. How many steps are required to export a data file? Are there any restrictions with your G/L codes?from Christina Honthy-Little's Full Review (8 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerProfessional in Corporate | Commercial Real Estate | 51-200 employeesAvidXchange Review: "Accounts Payables"5 of 10  |  7/8/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeAvidXchange is used by our whole organization in the corporate office as well as our property management throughout the US. We are a Real Estate Management Investment Company and we use AvidXchange to pay all our property payables. ProsAvidXchange invoicing system does flag duplicates if invoice information entered correctly by their Indexers.Their manual payments via check in my opinion seem to work better as vendors do not complain about payments as much.AvidPay Team is very supportive in helping out with vendor issues when payments have been made.ConsAvid Support does need improvement, in replying to tickets in a much faster and timely manner. Usually my experience is a turn around of 24 to 48 hours when I need an answer a bit faster to get to our property management team or vendor.Avid virtual credit card can be also improved by letting vendors know fees associated with receiving payments in this manner. Seems most vendors are confused with VCC type payments.Likelihood to Recommend5.0I feel AvidXchange needs to improve their payment system to better accommodate vendor needs and understanding of their pay process. Communication is their biggest weakness.from Authenticated Review (3 More Sections)Lori BabazAssistant Property Manager | Real Estate | 51-200 employeesUser Review: "AvidXchange Very User Friendly"10 of 10  |  4/3/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use AvidXchange within our office in order to provide a more reliable compliance process per our ownership's compliance policy. Our property management department mainly uses the product. We are able to process and approve multiple invoices that can then be approved by other individuals outside of our office without having to courier hard copies to them for a hard signature. I like the system as it allows you to pull reports without having to dig into paper files. You have everything at the click of the mouse. AvidXchange allows you to track invoices and see where they are sitting in the system. ProsYou can pull reports by specific general ledger codes. This comes in handy at year end when you are trying to make sure that you have all invoices in for the year.Everything is electronic. You do not have to worry about digging through paper files if you have a tenant that decides to audit you.It takes no time to approve invoices. You have all of them in your queue. You are able to see what is waiting to be approved and go right down the line.ConsWhen you run an invoice report of what has been approved for the week, I would like to see the date printed at the top of the cover sheet.Likelihood to Recommend10.0I think that someone thinking about using AvidXchange should ask how easy is it to maneuver the system. Is it user-friendly? How many people should be administrators of the system?from Lori Babaz's Full Review Authenticated ReviewerProfessional in Finance and Accounting | Real Estate | 51-200 employees"AvidXchange Product Review"9 of 10  |  12/18/2014Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeAvidXchange is being utilize by the whole organization.ProsInvoice RoutingTechnology InterfaceApproval MonitoringConsAllow high level validation checks when batching into third party software.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Great product for routing invoices for multiple people across multiple locations. from Authenticated Review (3 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerProfessional in Finance and Accounting | Real Estate | 51-200 employeesAvidXchange Review: "Straight to the point"8 of 10  |  9/18/2014Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeIt is our Accounts Payable system for the organization. It allows a business to be paperless, and therefore no need for storage space.ProsTimely invoice paymentRecord keepingTime stampsConsRunning audit reportsReport compatibility for exportsSearch by should include (by accounting code)Likelihood to Recommend8.0AvidXchange is more appropriate for businesses which process many invoices.

AVIDXCHANGE™





Payment Automation













  











AVIDXCHANGE™ AP & PAYMENT AUTOMATION





For most businesses, the accounts payable process is a nightmare. With AvidXchange, you can slash the time you spend on invoice approvals and payments by 60% or more – and significantly reduce your operating costs too. Plus, this cloud-based, fully integrated AP and Payment Automation solution eliminates your need for manual data entry and all the headaches that come along with it.









AVIDXCHANGE PURCHASE ORDER 


AvidXchange’s Purchase Order Application enables you to automate your company’s purchase order process and control costs by preventing unwanted purchases.
You begin your AP process by entering a requisition into the Invoice Application for the goods and/or services vendors require. That requisition is then sent into a workflow for approval. Once the requisition has the appropriate approvals, it becomes a purchase order and is sent to your vendor for fulfillment. After those goods and/or services have been rendered, the vendor will invoice you. When the invoice enters into AvidXchange, the purchase order is associated to the invoice using the original purchase order number, vendor, and amount that was established at the beginning of the process. The purchase order and all the individual line items and coding have now “flipped” to the invoice.


AVIDXCHANGE INVOICE 


AvidXchange Invoice mirrors your existing invoice approval process. Paper invoices are either scanned into an electronic format, or electronically submitted directly into the Invoice Application – either through direct data-import or through the Vendor Portal. Invoices are automatically coded, assigned to the appropriate workflow, and routed electronically for approval. Once fully approved, invoices flow directly into your accounting system for payment processing.


AVIDXCHANGE PAYMENT


AvidXchange’s full-service payment offerings are available using AvidPay, AvidXchange’s bill payment service. When you select payments in AvidPay to be paid, they are then sent over to the AvidPay Network. The AvidPay Network is the network through which your vendors get paid. The AvidPay Network optimizes the electronic payment mix, with an average electronic payment adoption of 45%.


AVIDXCHANGE CREATE-A-CHECK


For suppliers that you would like to pay in-house, AvidXchange Create-A-Check is available as a self-managed payment option. You manage your supplier data and can facilitate payments via MICR check, ACH/ EFT, and wire transfers in-house. 
Self-manage ACH, EFT, and Wire payments by submitting a payment file to your own bank. Email remittance or printed PDF copies are available for payee reference. Easily print MICR checks locally to blank check stock from multiple bank accounts by selecting your preferred bank account from a drop-down within the application. Create-a-Check replaces manual check signing with encrypted digitized signatures. Before checks are printed, single level payment approval processes ensure final approval on all checks to reduce the risk of fraudulent activity. 


INTEGRATION 


AvidXchange integrates with over 100 accounting systems. If your accounting system can import and export files, then we can work with you.
