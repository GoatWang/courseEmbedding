      Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-3
    





December 06, 2016 02:56 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust 2013-3 (SLM 2013-3):
    

      --Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Stable Outlook;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; removed Rating Watch Negative and assigned 
      Stable Outlook.
    

      On Dec. 2, 2016, the legal final maturity date of the SLM 2013-3 class 
      A-3 and B notes were extended to April 2055 and September 2076, 
      respectively. This effectively mitigates the maturity risk in Fitch's 
      cash flow modelling, resulting in the affirmation.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans 100%, with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The 
      U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 12.75% 
      and a 38.25% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario. The 
      base case default assumption of 12.75% implies a constant default rate 
      of 3.7% (assuming a weighted average life of 10.2 years) consistent with 
      the trailing-12-month (TTM) average constant default rate utilized in 
      the maturity stresses. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve. 
      The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in 
      the 'AAA' case.
    

      The TTM average of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior 
      to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) 
      are 11.5%, 17.9%, 16.7% and 12.5%, respectively, which are used as the 
      starting point in cash flow modeling. Subsequent declines or increases 
      are modeled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be 
      approximately 0.6%, based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit enhancement is provided by excess spread and, 
      for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 2016, total and 
      senior effective parity ratios, respectively, are 101.01% (1.00% CE) and 
      105.60% (5.30% CE). Liquidity support is provided by a reserve account 
      sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and $1,249,991, 
      currently equal to $ 2,027,823.12. The trust will continue to release 
      cash as long as the target overcollateralization amount of the greater 
      of 1.00% of adjusted pool balance or $2,000,000 is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's Student Loan ABS (SLABS) cash flow model 
      indicates that the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final 
      maturity dates under the commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient 
      Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes 
      Navient to be an acceptable servicer, due to its extensive track record 
      as the largest servicer of FFELP loans.
    

      Criteria Variation
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated Sept. 1, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest are those 
      held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested for a 
      short duration given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch does not 
      believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in 
      tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the 
      U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. 
      Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
    

      Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related 
      lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch 
      conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different 
      assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below 
      should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the 
      transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic 
      variables.
    

      Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --Default increase 25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      --Default increase 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAsf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      --Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity
    

      --CPR decrease 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'CCCsf'
    

      --CPR increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      --IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'
    

      --IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'
    

      It is important to note that the stresses are intended to provide an 
      indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected 
      deterioration in trust performance. Rating sensitivity should not be 
      used as an indicator of future rating performance.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-3HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on FirefoxÂ Â»YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 3 hrs 42 minsS&P 5002,470.49-4.93 (-0.20%)Dow 3021,807.41+10.86 (+0.05%)Nasdaq6,371.19-10.99 (-0.17%)Stocks to WatchIntel impresses with strong quarter, Starbucks and Mattel shares are tankingFitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-3Business WireDecember 6, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-3 (SLM 2013-3):--Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed Rating Watch Negative and assigned Stable Outlook;--Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; removed Rating Watch Negative and assigned Stable Outlook.On Dec. 2, 2016, the legal final maturity date of the SLM 2013-3 class A-3 and B notes were extended to April 2055 and September 2076, respectively. This effectively mitigates the maturity risk in Fitch's cash flow modelling, resulting in the affirmation.KEY RATING DRIVERSU.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans 100%, with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Stable Outlook.Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 12.75% and a 38.25% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario. The base case default assumption of 12.75% implies a constant default rate of 3.7% (assuming a weighted average life of 10.2 years) consistent with the trailing-12-month (TTM) average constant default rate utilized in the maturity stresses. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case.The TTM average of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 11.5%, 17.9%, 16.7% and 12.5%, respectively, which are used as the starting point in cash flow modeling. Subsequent declines or increases are modeled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.6%, based on information provided by the sponsor.Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.Payment Structure: Credit enhancement is provided by excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 2016, total and senior effective parity ratios, respectively, are 101.01% (1.00% CE) and 105.60% (5.30% CE). Liquidity support is provided by a reserve account sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and $1,249,991, currently equal to $ 2,027,823.12. The trust will continue to release cash as long as the target overcollateralization amount of the greater of 1.00% of adjusted pool balance or $2,000,000 is maintained.Maturity Risk: Fitch's Student Loan ABS (SLABS) cash flow model indicates that the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the commensurate rating scenario.Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes Navient to be an acceptable servicer, due to its extensive track record as the largest servicer of FFELP loans.Criteria VariationUnder the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds', dated Sept. 1, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest are those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.RATING SENSITIVITIES'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
