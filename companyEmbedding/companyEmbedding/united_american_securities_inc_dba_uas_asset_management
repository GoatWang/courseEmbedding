Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.

Building and preserving wealth requires a skilled approach to capturing value underscored by discipline, independent thinking and prudent judgment. 






 

Homecovaun2017-07-19T21:55:35+00:00 


At UAS Asset Management, we have applied this philosophy to our investment and wealth management business for over 25 years. In serving the needs of individuals, families and institutional investors, our professionals are keenly focused on investing in global businesses with superior economics, proven management, and strong brand value – characteristics which lead to enduring advantage.
We build portfolios of significant publicly traded global companies whose range of businesses provides inherent diversification and whose scale and tenure demonstrate durable competitive advantage. We invest when we believe prices are reasonable and maintain positions only when all advantages remain in place. Our high conviction results in relatively concentrated portfolios.
OUR FIRM
Our investors appreciate access to our investment team and take comfort from regular dialogue with the team entrusted with their assets.
UAS Asset Management has been entrusted to manage individual and institutional portfolios since 1987. The firm has followed the same investment philosophy for over twenty-five years. We consistently apply thorough fundamental research with dispassionate analytics, independent thinking, and discipline, while continuously learning and adapting.
As investment managers, we take responsibility for our clients’ assets as fiduciaries, always placing their interests first. We keep our team small and focused on core competencies and choosing to partner with world-class providers for all support functions. We work only with independent qualified custodians for the safekeeping of our clients’ assets.

OUR APPROACH
We approach investing from the perspective that preserving wealth is essential to building it. 
Our assessment of a company’s prospects and value relies on a variety of both quantitative and qualitative factors. We look for great companies whose business model we can understand and whose future earnings we believe we can reasonably estimate.  Our high conviction results in concentrated portfolios of distinctive companies whose brand value, diversified holdings, proven management and strong financial profile set them apart as leaders.
Importantly, we balance our fundamental analyses with a view toward long-term global trends and secular themes, seeking companies where we believe demand for their products and services is likely to grow based on positive demographic trends and increasing economic development.
Risk management goes hand-in-hand with portfolio construction.  Conventional wisdom equates risk with monthly, or even daily, volatility of prices of securities. We, on the other hand, regard risk as the likelihood of permanent loss of capital. Viewed in that light, we are focused on inherent value of our holdings not on the daily fluctuations of their prices. By investing only in publicly traded securities we further manage risk by maintaining highly liquid portfolios.
Consistent application of our investment philosophy enables clients to properly evaluate the efficacy of our investment strategy to achieve their objectives.
OUR PHILOSOPHY
Prudent investing centers on preserving and growing wealth for generations, as such we invest in companies who think likewise. 
The philosophy governing our approach to investing is straightforward: we want to own superior companies with good management at reasonable prices and remain owners as long as all three criteria are met. As such, our research is aimed at defining and assessing each of these aspects: what are superior economics, reasonable prices and good management and which companies possess them.
While our philosophy is simple and understandable, successful implementation is anything but. Not only does it require dispassionate analysis and research in assessing each potential investment, but, and perhaps more importantly, it requires patience, discipline and courage. 
We are proud of the quality of our research and analysis, but we believe that the real differentiator for UAS lies in our independent thinking and discipline in acting on well-reasoned convictions — going against the prevailing trend, takes a particular temperament and courage, honed by a disciplined process.
OUR OFFERING
Our primary service is management of equity portfolios in separately managed accounts (SMAs) for individuals, groups and institutions. In addition, we manage balanced accounts for clients who need current income by investing an appropriate portion of the portfolio in US Government bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.
We manage a variety of retirement accounts, including IRAs, 401(k)s and pension plans. In addition, we accept accounts for trusts, foundations, endowments, corporations, associations, and other pools of capital. In all cases, we coordinate our efforts with accountants, pension administrators, legal advisers, and other professionals assisting our clients.
For qualified investors, UAS offers an alternative investment vehicle with a performance-based fee structure.
OUR CLIENT FOCUS
Our clients are our business. We strive to build enduring relationships by understanding our clients’ needs and objectives, ensuring our clients know what they can expect from our team. 
We begin every client engagement with an open and honest dialogue designed to accomplish two goals: 

To gain an understanding of what the client’s needs and objectives are.
For the client to have a clear understanding of how we approach investing and the stewardship of their assets. We only embark on a new relationship when our approach and strategies are aligned with and can be effective in meeting our client’s financial goals.
