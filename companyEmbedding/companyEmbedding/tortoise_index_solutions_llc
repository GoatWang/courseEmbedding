Tortoise Launches Water Exchange Traded Fund (TBLU)






February 14, 2017 08:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tortoise Index Solutions, part of the Tortoise family, today announced 
      the launch of the Tortoise Water Fund (TBLU). TBLU is an ETF 
      designed to track the total return of the Tortoise Water IndexSM, 
      which is comprised of companies that are substantially engaged in the 
      water infrastructure and water management industries.
    


      “Water is critical for economic growth and social stability. We believe 
      that there is a tremendous need in the market for a quality index that 
      accurately represents the water industry,” said Jeremy Goff, Tortoise 
      director. “Creating this product is a natural extension of our strategy 
      to provide essential asset solutions in wrappers that are desired by 
      advisors and investors.”
    

      TBLU will employ a passive approach to provide exposure to water 
      infrastructure, management and treatment companies that appear poised to 
      benefit from the expected and much needed investment to rebuild existing 
      infrastructure, construct new infrastructure and better manage and 
      enhance the sustainability of this vital, but finite resource.
    

      “We believe that our fund offers the purest exposure to the water 
      industry by tracking an index that incorporates fundamental weighting 
      factors that recognize and adjust for the fragmented nature of the water 
      space,” said Matthew Weglarz, portfolio manager for the fund. “The 
      urgent need for investment in this essential asset, and the 
      infrastructure that supports it, is becoming increasingly recognized and 
      our fund provides a more direct way for investors to access the 
      opportunity.”
    

      TBLU is the second ETF offering from Tortoise Index Solutions. Its first 
      offering, Tortoise North American Pipeline Fund (TPYP), provides access 
      to the sizable pipeline network of one of the world’s largest consumers 
      of energy. The full suite of indices include: Tortoise Water IndexSM 
      (TBLUE/TBLUET), Tortoise MLP Index® (TMLP/TMLPT), 
      Tortoise North American Pipeline IndexSM (TNAP/TNAPT), 
      Tortoise Oil & Gas Producers IndexSM (TNEP/TNEPT) and 
      Tortoise Real Yield® Index (TYLD/TYLDT).

Tortoise Water IndexSM


      The Tortoise Water IndexSM is a float-adjusted, modified 
      market capitalization-weighted index comprised of companies that are 
      materially engaged in the water infrastructure or water management 
      industries. Water infrastructure companies provide public water 
      distribution or supporting water distribution infrastructure via 
      equipment or engineering and construction. Water management companies 
      provide technologies or products that manage or facilitate water 
      distribution and usage, including the fields of water efficiency, water 
      treatment and irrigation.
    

      The Tortoise MLP Index® is a float-adjusted, 
      capitalization-weighted index of energy master limited partnerships 
      (MLPs). The index is comprised of publicly traded companies organized in 
      the form of limited partnerships or limited liability companies engaged 
      in transportation, production, processing and/or storage of energy 
      commodities. The Tortoise North American Pipeline IndexSM is 
      a float-adjusted, capitalization weighted index of pipeline companies 
      headquartered in the United States and Canada. The Tortoise North 
      American Oil & Gas Producers IndexSM is a float-adjusted, 
      capitalization-weighted index of North American energy companies 
      primarily engaged in the production of crude oil, condensate, natural 
      gas or natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Tortoise Real Yield® 
      Index is a new differentiated index that aims to track real asset 
      exposure anchored in current income. It provides an efficient benchmark 
      for real yielding, tax pass-through, liquid companies that distribute 
      substantial cash flow streams to investors by investing in REITs (real 
      estate investment trusts), MLPs (master limited partnerships) and BDCs 
      (business development companies).
    

Forward-Looking Statement


      This press release contains certain statements that may include 
      “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included 
      herein are "forward-looking statements." Although the fund and Tortoise 
      Index Solutions believe that the expectations reflected in these 
      forward-looking statements are reasonable, they do involve assumptions, 
      risks and uncertainties, and these expectations may prove to be 
      incorrect. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
      in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, 
      including those discussed in the funds’ reports that are filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance 
      on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of 
      this press release. Other than as required by law, the fund and Tortoise 
      Index Solutions do not assume a duty to update this forward-looking 
      statement.
    

Safe Harbor Statement


      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.
    

Disclosures


The fund’s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses must be 
      considered carefully before investing. The summary and statutory 
      prospectus contains this and other important information about the fund 
      and may be obtained by calling 844-TR-INDEX (844-874-6339) or visiting www.tortoiseindexsolutions.com. 
      Read it carefully before investing.


Shares of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are not individually 
      redeemable and owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the 
      ETF and tender those shares for redemption to the ETF in Creation Units 
      only, see the ETF prospectus for additional information regarding 
      Creation Units. Investors may purchase or sell ETF shares throughout the 
      day through any brokerage account, which will result in typical 
      brokerage commissions.


Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The fund is 
      non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer 
      individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the fund is more 
      exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. 
      Investing in specific sectors such as energy pipelines may involve 
      greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments. The fund 
      is not actively managed and therefore the fund generally will not sell a 
      security due to current or projected underperformance of a security, 
      industry or sector, unless that security is removed from the index or 
      the selling of the security is otherwise required upon a rebalancing of 
      the index. There is no guarantee that the fund will achieve a high 
      degree of correlation to the index and therefore achieve its investment 
      objective. Shares may trade at prices different than net asset value per 
      share.


TBLU:


Investment in the water infrastructure and management industry may 
      significantly affect the value of the shares of the fund. Companies in 
      the water industry are subject to environmental considerations, taxes, 
      government regulation, price and supply fluctuations, competition and 
      water conservation influences. Investments in non-U.S. companies 
      (including Canadian issuers) involve risk not ordinarily associated with 
      investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including 
      risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, 
      differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting 
      requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in 
      foreign currencies. The fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, 
      which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater 
      volatility than larger companies. The fund has elected to be, and 
      intends to qualify each year for treatment as, a Regulated Investment 
      Company (RIC). To maintain the fund’s qualification for federal income 
      tax treatment as a RIC, the fund must meet certain source-of-income, 
      asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. If for any 
      taxable year the fund fails to qualify for the special federal income 
      tax treatment afforded to RICs, all of the fund’s taxable income will be 
      subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates (without any 
      deduction for distributions to its shareholders) and its income 
      available for distribution will be reduced. Derivatives involve risks 
      different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented 
      by more traditional investments.


TPYP:


Risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with 
      companies owning and/or operating energy pipelines, as well as Master 
      Limited Partnerships (MLPs), MLP affiliates, capital markets, terrorism, 
      natural disasters, climate change, operating, regulatory, environmental, 
      supply and demand, and price volatility risks. The tax benefits received 
      by an investor investing in the fund differ from that of a direct 
      investment in an MLP by an investor. The value of the fund’s investment 
      in an MLP will depend largely on the MLP’s treatment as a partnership 
      for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a 
      corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation, 
      reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the fund which 
      could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. Investments in non-U.S. 
      companies (including Canadian issuers) involve risk not ordinarily 
      associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. 
      issuers, including risks related to political, social and economic 
      developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and 
      accounting requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as 
      fluctuations in foreign currencies. The fund invests in small and midcap 
      companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and 
      greater volatility than larger companies.


This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the 
      solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these 
      securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would 
      be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities 
      laws of any state.

The value of the fund’s investment in an MLP will depend largely on the MLP’s treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the fund which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. Investments in non-U.S. companies (including Canadian issuers) involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. The fund invests in small and midcap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. 
TBLU:
Investment in the water infrastructure and management industry may significantly affect the value of the shares of the fund. Companies in the water industry are subject to environmental considerations, taxes, government regulation, price and supply fluctuations, competition and water conservation influences. Investments in non-U.S. companies (including Canadian issuers) involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. The fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. The fund has elected to be, and intends to qualify each year for treatment as, a regulated investment company (RIC). To maintain the fund’s qualification for federal income tax treatment as a RIC, the fund must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. If for any taxable year the fund fails to qualify for the special federal income tax treatment afforded to RICs, all of the fund’s taxable income will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates (without any deduction for distributions to its shareholders) and its income available for distribution will be reduced. Derivatives involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. 
The funds are not actively managed and therefore the funds generally will not sell a security due to current or projected underperformance of a security, industry or sector, unless that security is removed from the index or the selling of the security is otherwise required upon a rebalancing of the index. There is no guarantee that the funds will achieve a high degree of correlation to the index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Shares may trade at prices different than net asset value per share. 
The Tortoise Water IndexSM is a float-adjusted, modified market capitalization-weighted index comprised of companies that are materially engaged in the water infrastructure or water management industries. Water infrastructure companies’ provide public water distribution or supporting water distribution infrastructure via equipment or engineering and construction. Water management companies provide technologies or products that manage or facilitate water distribution and usage, including the fields of water efficiency, water treatment and irrigation.

Overview

The Tortoise Real Yield® Index is a differentiated index that aims to track real asset exposure anchored in current income. It provides an efficient benchmark for real yielding, tax pass-through, liquid companies that distribute substantial cash flow streams to investors by investing in REITs (real estate investment trusts), MLPs (master limited partnerships) and BDCs (business development companies). The index provides a benchmark of companies with tangible essential assets that are supportive of economic activity with no commodity futures, precious metals, TIPS (treasury inflation-protected securities) or foreign currency exposure.

Why Real Yield®
Comprehensive yield-focused real asset companies illustrate relevant investment opportunity, now and
	across business cycles
What defined the last 25 years – declining interest rates and low inflation – is not necessarily what
	can be expected going forward
Defines equity-like exposure to real assets with attractive yield and diversification potential
Helpful benchmark for investors with recurring, multi-year funding obligations

 

Key Eligibility Requirements:


NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSE MKT or another major U.S. exchange-listed REITs (excluding mortgage REITs), oil & gas MLPs and BDCs
Market capitalization of $500 million for REITs and MLPs, $300 million for BDCs
3-month average daily value traded is $5 million for REITs and MLPs and $3 million for BDCs

About Tortoise North American Pipeline Fund (NYSE Arca: TPYP)

      The Tortoise North American Pipeline Fund employs a “passive management” 
      – or indexing – investment approach designed to track the performance of 
      the underlying index. The underlying index is a proprietary rules-based, 
      capitalization weighted, float- adjusted index designed to track the 
      overall performance of equity securities of North American pipeline 
      companies.
    
About Tortoise North American Pipeline IndexSM

      The Tortoise North American Pipeline Index is a float-adjusted, 
      capitalization weighted index of pipeline companies that are organized 
      and have their principal place of business in the United States or 
      Canada. A pipeline company is defined as a company that either 1) has 
      been assigned a standard industrial classification (“SIC”) system code 
      that indicates the company operates in the energy pipeline industry or 
      2) has at least 50% of its assets, cash flow or revenue associated with 
      the operation or ownership of energy pipelines. Pipeline companies 
      engage in the business of transporting natural gas, crude oil and 
      refined products, storing, gathering and processing such gas, oil and 
      products and local gas distribution. The index is the exclusive property 
      of Tortoise
    
      Index Solutions, LLC, which has contracted with S&P Opco, LLC (a 
      subsidiary of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC) (“S&P Dow Jones Indices”) to 
      calculate and maintain the index. S&P® is a registered 
      trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“SPFS”); Dow Jones® is 
      a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow 
      Jones”); and, these trademarks have been licensed to S&P Dow Jones 
      Indices. “Calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices” and its related stylized 
      mark(s) have been licensed for use by Tortoise Index Solutions, LLC and 
      its affiliates. Neither S&P Dow Jones Indices, SPFS, Dow Jones nor any 
      of their affiliates sponsor and promote the Index and none shall be 
      liable for any errors or omissions in calculating the Index. It is not 
      possible to invest directly in an index.
    
Forward-Looking Statement

      This press release contains certain statements that may include 
      “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included 
      herein are "forward-looking statements." Although the fund and Tortoise 
      Index Solutions believe that the expectations reflected in these 
      forward-looking statements are reasonable, they do involve assumptions, 
      risks and uncertainties, and these expectations may prove to be 
      incorrect. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
      in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, 
      including those discussed in the funds’ reports that are filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance 
      on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of 
      this press release. Other than as required by law, the fund and Tortoise 
      Index Solutions do not assume a duty to update this forward-looking 
      statement.
    
Safe Harbor Statement

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.
    
Disclosures

The fund’s objective, risks, charges and expenses must be considered 
      carefully before investing. The summary and statutory prospectus 
      contains this and other important information about the fund and may be 
      obtained by calling 844-TR-INDEX (844-874-6339) or visiting www.tortoiseindexsolutions.com. 
      Read it carefully before investing.

Shares of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are not individually 
      redeemable and owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the 
      ETF and tender those shares for redemption to the ETF in Creation Units 
      only, see the ETF prospectus for additional information regarding 
      Creation Units. Investors may purchase or sell ETF shares throughout the 
      day through any brokerage account, which will result in typical 
      brokerage commissions.
    
Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The fund is 
      non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer 
      individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the fund is more 
      exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. 
      Investing in specific sectors such as energy pipelines may involve 
      greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments. Risks 
      include, but are not limited to, risks associated with companies owning 
      and/or operating energy pipelines, as well as Master Limited 
      Partnerships (MLPs), MLP affiliates, capital markets, terrorism, natural 
      disasters, climate change, operating, regulatory, environmental, supply 
      and demand, and price volatility risks. The tax benefits received by an 
      investor investing in the fund differ from that of a direct investment 
      in an MLP by an investor. The value of the fund’s investment in an MLP 
      will depend largely on the MLP’s treatment as a partnership for U.S. 
      federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation 
      then its income would be subject to federal taxation, reducing the 
      amount of cash available for distribution to the fund which could result 
      in a reduction of the fund’s value. Investments in non-U.S. companies 
      (including Canadian issuers) involve risk not ordinarily associated with 
      investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including 
      risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, 
      differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting 
      requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in 
      foreign currencies. The fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, 
      which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater 
      volatility than larger companies.

The fund is not actively managed and therefore the fund generally 
      will not sell a security due to current or projected underperformance of 
      a security, industry or sector, unless that security is removed from the 
      index or the selling of the security is otherwise required upon a 
      rebalancing of the index. There is no guarantee that the fund will 
      achieve a high degree of correlation to the index and therefore achieve 
      its investment objective. Shares may trade at prices different than net 
      asset value per share.

      Nothing contained in this communication constitutes tax, legal, or 
      investment advice. Investors must consult their tax advisor or legal 
      counsel for advice and information concerning their particular 
      situation. Certain marketing or sales related support provided by 
      Montage Investments and certain of its affiliates, none of which are 
      affiliated with Foreside Fund Services, LLC. Montage Investments is the 
      indirect majority owner of Tortoise Index Solutions, the adviser to the 
      fund.
