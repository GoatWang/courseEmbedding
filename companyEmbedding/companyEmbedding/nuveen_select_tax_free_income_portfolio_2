							Other Expenses and Total Expenses do not include interest expenses arising from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse floating rate securities (if any) held by the Fund. Interest expense arises because accounting rules require the fund to treat interest paid by trusts issuing certain inverse floating rate instruments held by the fund as having been paid (indirectly) by the fund. Because the fund also recognizes a corresponding amount of additional income earned (also indirectly), the fund's net asset value per share, net investment income and total return have not been affected by this accounting treatment. See the fund's Annual Report for information on the fund's inverse floating rate investments and recognized interest expense.
Expense ratios are calculated using the prior 12 months of expense data as of the previous month-end.








Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of closed-end funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



An investment in this fund presents a number of risks and is not suitable for all investors. Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing. For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this fund, please view the Overview tab.




				NOTES


1 The ratio of total assets of the Fund, less all liabilities that are not outstanding borrowings or outstanding preferreds, at par, to the sum of the Fund’s outstanding borrowings and outstanding preferreds, at par.

^ The annualized ratio of the sum of leverage costs to the average leverage amount for a given time period.

Objective
The fund's primary objective is current income exempt from regular federal income tax, consistent with preservation of capital.


Highlights
Seeks to provide:
Attractive monthly    tax-free income
Portfolio diversification
Attractive after tax total returns




Investment Strategy
The fund invests in municipal securities that are exempt from federal income taxes.  The fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated  investment grade (Baa/BBB or better by S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch) at the time of investment, or, if they are unrated, are judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. The fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated below investment quality or judged by the manager to be of comparable quality, of which up to 10% of its managed assets may be rated below B-/B3 or of comparable quality. The fund may invest in inverse floating rate municipal securities, also known as tender option bonds. The fund’s use of tender option bonds to more efficiently implement its investment strategy may create up to 10% effective leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

THE THING ABOUT UNFAIR ADVANTAGES IS, THEY'RE AWESOME.

                    Unfair advantages are an outrage. Until you're the one who has them. Then they're like the best thing ever. Clever tax breaks. Shrewd deductions. Opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. The only time those things aren't awesome is when they're unavailable to regular people. At TaxAct, we don't "make things fair." What fun is there in that? We make unfair accessible to all. What could be more American?

Best Tax Software for 2017






 

 by Michael Gardon
Updated on 06.08.17






 

Taxes are never, ever fun — especially if you’re just getting started on them with only days left before the filing deadline. You don’t need to dread April 18th, though — that’s right, the 2017 filing deadline is April 18th, not the traditional date of the 15th. Tax software has come along way, and if you choose the right option, you’ll be able to knock your taxes out quickly and confidently. 2017’s list of the best tax software companies features three faithful standouts: TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct.





Get Started
on Intuit's secure website



We have a clear favorite pick this year (the fourth year in a row, in fact). It’s TurboTax, and it’s our top pick for several reasons. It’s the easiest to use; it has the most comprehensive set of features; and best of all, it’s absolutely free for millions of Americans filing a 1040EZ or 1040A (and state returns) thanks to a resurgence of the company’s Absolute Zero program.
That’s available to anyone who has an income of less than $100,000; doesn’t have sizable medical bills to deduct; and doesn’t claim any rental, investment, or business income. Pretty great, right?
The Simple Dollar’s Picks for the Best Tax Software for 2017


TurboTax


H&R Block


TaxAct


The best tax software doesn’t just get your taxes filed — it educates users, leaving them confident about their return rather than worried about an audit. As a result, we dug deep into user experience this year. We put each software package through the wringer, evaluating facilitation, disbursement, accuracy tools, and deduction discovery. We also considered how much we enjoyed using it (yes, you can enjoy using tax software). We also looked for a few key features: an accuracy guarantee, audit-risk identification tools, multiple refund-disbursement options, strong customer support, and the ability to import all of your forms and data. And when we learned that the number of TurboTax users (6 million) filing from smartphones and tablets is up 15 percent from the previous year, we favored software with great mobile apps, too.
TurboTax, H&R Block, or TaxAct: What is the Best Tax Software?
TurboTax
Start TurboTax Federal Free Edition Here
Intuit’s TurboTax remains the industry’s most streamlined and intuitive tax software package for the 2016 fiscal year. Whether you’re self-employed, freelancing on the side, or filing a 1040EZ, TurboTax has all the tools you need to minimize headaches and capitalize on your return. Just remember: Its pricing schedule is a bit more confusing and expensive than competitors, so you might wind up paying more than you imagined depending on the complexity of your tax situation.
One of TurboTax’s most compelling features is SmartLook™, which connects users with a CPA or enrolled agent via one-way video. Users can share their screen and receive expert help, for free, with an unlimited amount of requests. What’s more, Intuit improved the tool for 2016 by adding the ability to schedule appointments, which tightens its competition with H&R Block, which boasts 12,000 in-person locations nationwide. SmartLook™ isn’t available for Federal Free Edition users, but outside of sitting in a room with a tax professional, it’s one of the best customer support tools in the industry, bar none.
TurboTax also upped its game this year with the launch of a brand-new tool for the self-employed called Expense Finder. Once connected to a user’s bank account, Expense Finder helps to pinpoint every single transaction from the past year that might qualify as an expense. It can be difficult to keep track of every nickel and dime spent on things like travel and food, so this is a welcome addition to the TurboTax family. Plus, users get a free, one-year subscription to Intuit QuickBooks.
  H&R Block
Start With H&R Block Here
H&R Block is one of the most trusted names in finance thanks to its excellent customer service. With over 12,000 locations in the United States, you’re likely not far from speaking face-to-face with a professional who can help you sift through the financial maze. And regardless of which plan (edition) you choose, you also get free, in-person audit support.
The company’s software isn’t quite as simple or feature-rich as TurboTax, but it can be more affordable for small-business owners and those with multiple investments and properties. TurboTax’s “Premium” edition runs about $140 (state and federal), while H&R Block’s “Premium” edition costs around $90. Both cover the same forms from schedules C, D, E, and F (those that are related to deductions, self-employment, and investment income), but H&R Block customers get the benefit of in-person support while also saving $50.
TaxACT
Start With TaxAct Here
TaxAct is the most affordable option out there. Consider this: The company’s top-of-the-line edition, called Premium, runs $55 and includes forms from schedules C, D, E, and F — that means freelancers, homeowners, investors, and the self-employed can take advantage of the same deductions available on TurboTax’s “Self-Employed” ($140) and “Premium” ($92) editions for almost half the price. However, TaxAct has limited e-filing capabilities because it doesn’t support forms 1041 and 1065 in every state. So if you plan to file online, make sure to check whether TaxAct supports the forms you need.
The flipside to its affordability is that TaxAct doesn’t offer as robust customer support as the likes of TurboTax’s SmartLook™ CPA video chat or H&R Block’s 12,000 office sites. But if you don’t mind forgoing the bells and whistles, TaxAct is one of the best, and most affordable, software options available.
Still sounding a little too spendy? Check out our Best Free Tax Software Guide to see if there is a good option that fits your needs.
What should the best tax software have?

Accuracy guarantee: If you pay an IRS or state penalty or interest because of a calculation error, the company pays you for the penalty and interest.
Audit-risk identification: Tools that help you identify red flags that trigger audits, like failing to report all your income, or breaking rules on foreign accounts.
Refund disbursement options: Users can choose how a refund is paid, including via check, direct deposit, prepaid debit card, savings bonds, etc.
Strong customer support system: A comprehensive knowledge base, live chat, email support, etc.
Data import: The ability to import your W-2 by taking a picture, or at the very least, importing information from your previous tax return.

Which deductions should the best tax software offer?
Aside from the standard deductions — $9,300 for head of household filers, $6,300 for singles and married persons filing separate returns, and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly — we only considered software that also offered:

Charity Donations
Itemized Deductions
Business Owner Deductions
Depreciation Summary
Vehicle Deduction Methods
Rental Property Deductions

How to Choose the Best Tax Preparation Software for You
The needs for a nine-to-five employee and a CEO of a startup company are worlds apart. Maybe you’re like me and work multiple freelance jobs. Your tax software is completely dependent on your specific tax needs.
First-Timers: TurboTax Free Edition
If you’re new to paying taxes, I highly recommend starting with the free version of our top income tax software choice, TurboTax. It’s reliable and intuitive, and should make your first time filing taxes a bit less painful. If you’re lucky, your taxes will be simple enough that you don’t have to upgrade beyond the Free Edition.
Best Small Business Tax Software: H&R Block
It’s always nice to have someone watching your back, especially if you’re in charge of a small business. With H&R Block, you can take your taxes to any local office and have someone look over it for free. The personal touch of H&R Block’s customer service makes it a no-brainer for any business owners out there. It’s the best tax software for small business, hands down.
Best Professional Tax Software for Experienced Tax Filers: TurboTax
Overall, TurboTax still remains the best tax software for the serious tax filer. The intuitive software is built to handle even the most complicated tax needs with ease. TurboTax rapidly determines everything from refunds and deductibles to accurate audit risks.
Income Tax Calculator
We’ve built an income tax calculator to help you determine your federal and state income tax; total income tax; and expected take-home earnings based on your filing type, locations, and annual earnings. This should help you prepare and plan your taxes as well as manage your finances for the year, especially if you owe more money than you anticipated because you didn’t withhold enough.




A Guide to the Different Versions of Tax Software
Thankfully, finding the right version of your software isn’t as difficult as it sounds. Since it behooves these tax-filing companies to move your money as effortlessly as possible, they’ve allowed for smooth upgrading, if needed for your current tax situation. If you’re unsure of where your exact needs lie, I would recommend starting with each company’s free tax software option and working your way up, or staying there if it covers you. Your income flow and your situation will dictate which tier you’ll be in, but I’ll give you a quick rundown of the four main levels offered by the best tax software companies:
Federal Free Edition — The best deal, this provides the resources to prepare and e-file both federal and state taxes and is generally utilized by those with the most basic tax needs. Federal filing is free, but state filing typically incurs a fee.
Basic Edition — Includes all the features found in the Federal Free Edition with the addition of access to basic deduction-identification tools and improved support.
Deluxe Edition — Generally offers more to identify deductions through industry- or occupation-specific searches. May also include more robust tools for life events, donations, and audit risk.
Premium Edition — Generally grants access to the full functionality of the software with deduction assistance that expands to include rental properties and other business-specific tax deductions, along with advanced calculators and additional investment resources.
Tax Software Comparison: TurboTax vs. H&R Block vs. TaxAct
While we have found TurboTax to be the best tax software option overall, all of the main competitors have something unique to bring to the table. To remove any remaining bias, let’s compare some of the measurable qualities of each tax software option.
The table below compares the main components of each contender, not a breakdown of every feature these companies have to offer. You can find our deeper dive into the ins and outs of our main competitors below.

Online Tax Software Reviews: A Deeper Look at the Top 3
TurboTax: The Best Tax Preparation Software
TurboTax is undeniably the most recognizable name in tax prep software, and it has the chops to back it up. Its audit and deduction tools are the best in the business, and its list of features is ever growing with the addition of SmartLook™ video support and Expense Finder for the self-employed. And like H&R Block, TurboTax allows users to upload their W-2 by taking a picture with a mobile device. (If your payroll provider is one of TurboTax’s many partners, you can even import your W-2 online.) Here are a few more highlights:

A comprehensive Federal Free Edition that includes 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040 forms as well as live chat
Incredibly easy-to-use software
The best mobile app in the business
Expense Finder, which helps the self-employed identify every possible deduction
Incredibly thorough AnswerXchange knowledge base
Strong customer support, including SmartLook™ expert video chat
Heads-up audit detection while you file your taxes
A wide array of disbursement options
Trusty phone support hotline

TurboTax Downsides
While TurboTax is the overall best tax software in the field, it’s not without its weaknesses. As many disgruntled users will point out, the price has steadily climbed over the past few years and stands as one of the most expensive options on the market. (For example, TurboTax charges $80 to file federal taxes online, compared to competitor H&R Block’s $60.) But, like we mentioned before, if you have a simple tax situation, you can file absolutely free through TurboTax’s Absolute Zero program.
It’s also important to note the company has a steep processing fee of $34.99 if you pay your TurboTax fee with your federal refund.
H&R Block: The Best Customer Support at an Affordable Price
With over 12,000 locations spanning the US, H&R Block is able to provide a personal touch that TurboTax and TaxAct can’t match. And the best part is that no matter which plan you choose — the free online edition, or the paid desktop edition — everyone gets access to a real-life tax professional. All you have to do is visit the office with the giant green block. Here are a few more highlights:

Standout tools to help with more complex tax needs, including deductions
Helpful page-by-page overviews and step-by-step workflow guidance
Premium edition is $30-$50 cheaper than TurboTax’s.
Peppered with links throughout each page to answer any questions you might have, such as “What qualifies?”
A bookmarking system lets you tag anything you want to refer to later.
File federal taxes for free with the At Home Free Edition, which provides many tax forms other competitors don’t, plus free audit support and representation.

H&R Block Downsides
Right now, you may be asking, “With such incredible customer service, why isn’t H&R Block the best tax software?” Frankly, its bland website and slightly confusing interface can’t compete with the simplicity of TurboTax. But if you’d feel more confident having a copilot on your tax journey, H&R’s marginally less attractive software is hardly a good reason to skip it.
TaxAct: The Best Cheap Tax Software
TaxAct is undeniably one of the most affordable tax software options on the market for the standard taxpayer — its most expensive plan is less than half the price of TurboTax, and it supports the exact same forms. A big reason for these savings is found in its lack of features for the self-employed, investors, or property owners. To be clear, you can still use TaxAct if you fit in those categories, but it won’t be as easy as using TurboTax or H&R Block. The bottom line is this: If you’re a straightforward W-2 employee with a simple return, TaxAct has all you need to effectively file your taxes and save some cash. Here are a few more highlights:

Offers top value without sacrificing quality (only extras)
Provides a pre-built spreadsheet where you enter information like reporting category, sales proceeds, gains/losses, and other relevant stock information
Limited state e-filing
A useful “Refund Snapshot” dashboard
Mini-alerts identify errors and robust learning resources make sure you get all the help you need.
With the Free Edition, you can file federal tax forms for simple and complex tax returns for different statuses and life situations.

TaxAct Downsides
TaxAct’s educational resources have improved since last year, but it still doesn’t match TurboTax’s offerings. It also has a few lightweight features, like a deductions calculator and “Life Changes” event wizard (which alerts customers to important information related to life events and how they impact taxes), but they aren’t as fleshed out as comparable tools from the other companies. Finally, TaxAct doesn’t allow you to import your W-2 by taking a photo like TurboTax and H&R Block. Once you put it in manually, though, you can important it from previous tax returns in the future.
Other Tax Software to Consider
Although TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct were our top picks, TaxSlayer and eSmartTax are also worth a look.
TaxSlayer
TaxSlayer Highlights:

You can choose to be guided or not, which is great if you’re confident in your tax abilities and want to bypass all the quizzes.
Prior-year tax form access makes it easy to prepare your forms and alter them to save time.
The life events guide makes sure you correctly input information about births, a new home, etc.

Why TaxSlayer Didn’t Make the Cut

Deduction tools aren’t as strong as the top three — items like charity donations, rental properties, and industry-specific deductions aren’t identified.
No live chat or user forum to get help instantly — however your questions do jump to the front of the queue for faster response time via the premium service.

eSmartTax
eSmartTax Highlights:

Great Affordable Care Act (ACA) forms and resources
A clean and modern interface makes this software easy to navigate.
Owned by Liberty Tax, which has office locations available for in-person help.
You can import prior-year forms and pre-populate information to save time.

Why eSmartTax Didn’t Make the Cut

It’s missing some of the more common features like a life events adviser and tax calculator.
Deduction discovery resources are very limited, which won’t suffice for more complicated tax situations.
Sale-of-home feature is only available at its Premium level. The sale of a home is a fairly common transaction that would be a no-brainer at a Deluxe tier level.

Final Thoughts
Whether you’re filing for your family, your business, or yourself, the biggest piece of advice is to be proactive. While we all lead busy lives, it’s always best to get a jump on the upcoming tax season and not let it sneak up on you.
Admittedly, there will never be a replacement for hiring a professional to take care of your taxes. But for anyone looking to save some money and take matters into their own hands, we’ve found TurboTax to be the best tax software on the market. Its ease of use and intuitive design paired with the gravitas carried by its name make it the premier option on the market. H&R Block and TaxAct aren’t hanging too far behind, offering unsurpassed customer service and affordability, respectively. But for the majority of taxpayers, your best bet is the slick industry hallmark: TurboTax.

THE THING ABOUT UNFAIR ADVANTAGES IS, THEY'RE AWESOME.

                    Unfair advantages are an outrage. Until you're the one who has them. Then they're like the best thing ever. Clever tax breaks. Shrewd deductions. Opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. The only time those things aren't awesome is when they're unavailable to regular people. At TaxAct, we don't "make things fair." What fun is there in that? We make unfair accessible to all. What could be more American?
