Archrock Stock Getting Very Oversold
In trading on Tuesday, shares of Archrock Inc entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $11.5637 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

Mar 14, 2017 3:57 PM EDT









YieldBoost AROC To 20.3% Using Options
Shareholders of Archrock Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.6% annualized dividend yield can sell the August covered call at the $15 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.00 bid, which annualizes to an additional 16.7% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 20.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $15 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AROC shares would have to climb 13.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 20.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.
