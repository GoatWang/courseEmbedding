A New Mother for Sarah Alexander
 

(Megan Kaye Hyer interviews her mother, Trisha Bischoff Hyer, about her grandmother Sarah Alexander Tolman who was the daughter of Owen Joshua Tolman and Sarah Baskerviller Alexander. Contributed on 16 October 2014.)
I interviewed my mother, Trisha Bischoff Hyer about her grandmother Sarah Tolman.
Sarah Alexander Tolman Egbert was born on February 27, 1913. Her mother was Sarah Baskerville Alexander born in Marian, Cassia County Idaho. Her father was Owen Joshua Tolman, Born in Salt Lake City, Utah in a little log cabin where the Walker Bank building is now. He lived the rugged life of a pioneer. Owen & Sarah Baskerville were married in the Salt Lake Temple on October 3, 1902.
Sarah had four siblings; Louis Owen, Emerson Alexander, Mary Cydona, and Winona. They were all born in Marion Idaho. Sarah married Parley Milton Egbert and they had five children. Parley Lamar Egbert (27, September 1935), Ireta Rae Egbert Hodges (17 June, 1937), Dolores Ann Egbert Bischoff (14 April 1939), Dennis Wayne Egbert (18 June 1943), and Janice Marie Egbert Cathcart (13 January 1942). Dolores married Gary Bischoff and they had six children. Tawny, Kimberli, Janae, Trisha, Jason, and Kjiel. Trisha is my mother. Most of the descendants of Sarah and Parley live in the Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah areas.
When Sarah was just five days old her mother past away from pneumonia.  Sarah was then named after her mother. Owen’s sister Lydia was there when the mother died and she wanted a baby badly. Owen told her that if she did not marry the man that she was engaged to she could raise Sarah. So she remained single and took the child for herself. Lydia met and married Albert L. Egbert two years later. They started a family and she became the oldest of nine children. She had two sets of parents but lived with Lydia and her family.
