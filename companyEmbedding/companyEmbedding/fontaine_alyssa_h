ITHACA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tompkins Financial Corporation (NYSE MKT:TMP)



      Alyssa H. Fontaine will join Tompkins Financial Corporation as Executive 
      Vice President and General Counsel effective January 1, 2016.
    

      “Alyssa has worked on many legal projects for Tompkins Financial during 
      the last several years,” said Steve Romaine, Tompkins’ President and 
      CEO. “She has demonstrated her ability to provide sound legal advice 
      combined with a strong business sense. She will be a welcome addition to 
      the senior leadership team of our Company.”
    

      Currently a partner with Harris Beach PLLC, Fontaine is a member of the 
      firm’s Corporate Practice Group and serves on the Financial Institutions 
      and Capital Markets Industry Team. She focuses on corporate 
      transactional work, bank regulatory compliance and securities matters. 
      Her experience in mergers and acquisitions includes identifying 
      appropriate deal structures for public and private clients, assisting in 
      the negotiation of deal terms and drafting deal agreements.
    

      She is a graduate of Cornell Law School and Brown University, and lives 
      in Ithaca, New York with her husband and two children.
    

      Fontaine is a recipient of the “40 under Forty” award from the CNY 
      Business Journal, and she was also named a Super Lawyers 
      Rising Star for 2015. She is a member of the Board of Directors of the 
      Ithaca Community Childcare Center (IC3).
    

      Ed Hooks of Harris Beach has served as Tompkins’ General Counsel since 
      1992. He will retire at the end of this year.
    

      “We are grateful to Ed for his dedication to serving our company during 
      more than two decades of strong growth from a single bank entity to a 
      corporation with four banks, an insurance agency and a wealth management 
      affiliate,” Romaine said.

      Alyssa H. Fontaine will join Tompkins Financial Corporation as Executive 
      Vice President and General Counsel effective January 1, 2016.
    

      “Alyssa has worked on many legal projects for Tompkins Financial during 
      the last several years,” said Steve Romaine, Tompkins’ President and 
      CEO. “She has demonstrated her ability to provide sound legal advice 
      combined with a strong business sense. She will be a welcome addition to 
      the senior leadership team of our Company.”
    

      Currently a partner with Harris Beach PLLC, Fontaine is a member of the 
      firm’s Corporate Practice Group and serves on the Financial Institutions 
      and Capital Markets Industry Team. She focuses on corporate 
      transactional work, bank regulatory compliance and securities matters. 
      Her experience in mergers and acquisitions includes identifying 
      appropriate deal structures for public and private clients, assisting in 
      the negotiation of deal terms and drafting deal agreements.
    

      She is a graduate of Cornell Law School and Brown University, and lives 
      in Ithaca, New York with her husband and two children.
    

      Fontaine is a recipient of the “40 under Forty” award from the CNY

      “We are grateful to Ed for his dedication to serving our company during 
      more than two decades of strong growth from a single bank entity to a 
      corporation with four banks, an insurance agency and a wealth management 
      affiliate,” Romaine said.
