      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than 
      statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements 
      regarding the Company’s future financial position, business strategy, 
      targets, projected sales, costs, earnings, capital expenditures, debt 
      levels and cash flows, and plans and objectives of management for future

      statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to

      beyond the Company’s control, which could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking 
      statements. These factors include the cyclical nature of the Company’s 
      access equipment, commercial and fire & emergency markets, which are 
      particularly impacted by the strength of U.S. and European economies; 
      the Company’s estimates of access equipment demand; the strength of the 
      U.S. dollar and its impact on Company exports, translation of foreign 
      sales and purchased materials; the expected level and timing of DoD and 
      international defense customer procurement of products and services and 
      funding thereof; risks related to reductions in government expenditures 
      in light of U.S. defense budget pressures, sequestration, an uncertain 
      DoD tactical wheeled vehicle strategy and uncertainties associated with 
      government contracts; risks related to the JLTV production contract 
      award that the Company recently received, including those associated 
      with commencement of production under the contract; the Company’s 
      ability to finalize international contracts for a significant quantity 
      of M-ATVs, with sales beginning in fiscal 2016; the Company’s ability to 
      increase prices to raise margins or offset higher input costs; 
      increasing commodity and other raw material costs, particularly in a 
      sustained economic recovery; risks related to facilities expansion, 
      consolidation and alignment, including the amounts of related costs and 
      charges and that anticipated cost savings may not be achieved; global 
      economic uncertainty, which could lead to additional impairment charges 
      related to many of the Company’s intangible assets and/or a slower 
      recovery in the Company’s cyclical businesses than Company or equity 
      market expectations; projected adoption rates of work at height 
      machinery in emerging markets; the impact of severe weather or natural 
      disasters that may affect the Company, its suppliers or its customers; 
      risks related to the collectability of receivables, particularly for 
      those businesses with exposure to construction markets; the cost of any 
      warranty campaigns related to the Company’s products; risks related to 
      production or shipment delays arising from quality or production issues; 
      risks associated with international operations and sales, including 
      compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the Company’s ability 
      to comply with complex laws and regulations applicable to U.S. 
      government contractors; cybersecurity risks and costs of defending 
      against, mitigating and responding to a data security breach; and risks 
      related to the Company’s ability to successfully execute on its 
      strategic road map and meet its long-term financial goals. Additional 
      information concerning these and other factors is contained in the

Trust Plays Big Role in Corporate Culture 
By Szews, Charles L.

Read preview




Article excerpt

Customers, suppliers and employees seek to work with companies that sustain a strong reputation built not only on the quality of a company's products and services but also on the trust that in every interaction, a company will "do the right thing."The impetus to do the right thing becomes that much stronger when the company is engaged in the provision of products to warfighters. In the defense industry, doing the right thing protects American lives and has national security implications.This reality is at the heart of the National Defense Industrial Association's Code of Ethics, which it created as a best practices guide for its membership. Creating a company culture to "do the right thing" doesn't happen by chance but by design, and the code provides a solid first step for any company as it designs its ethics and compliance program.But a strong ethical corporate culture doesn't develop without the active engagement of strong leaders designing the processes that foster the right culture. It takes commitment from company leadership and a willingness to drive that throughout an entire organization. It can't be just a slogan or "flavor of the week." It requires executive leadership exhibiting ethical behaviors and actions. It demands resources, repetition and a pledge to use a variety of media to reach the hearts and minds of all employees. But, the payoff is engaged employees doing the right thing for the warfighter, suppliers and each other.The culture is known as "The Oshkosh Way." Employees are proactive with frequent communications and in-person training, including code of conduct training tailored to the needs of our team members. For example, training is tailored for specific functions like procurement, sales and finance, and by business and country to address specific types of transactions or risks. The goal is to reach the hearts and minds of our employees to do the right thing in their language, wherever they are around the world.If they are exposed to the values enough, they will embrace them and model those values. The message of doing the right thing is seen and heard throughout the company through a variety of communications. We embed messages in our new hire orientation, all employee meetings, each segment's newsletter, staff meetings and email. As team members embrace the commitment to not simply be compliant, but do what's right, they act in accordance with the values. Moreover, by watching other team members' model ethical behavior, it holds everyone to a greater standard.The advantage to having all team members at all levels of the organization exhibiting ethical behavior is that it eventually becomes the norm. In fact, there are some tangible differences. For instance, team members are requesting more ethics and compliance training and communications. …
