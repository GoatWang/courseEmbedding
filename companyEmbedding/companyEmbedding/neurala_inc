IDEALLY, A ROBOT WOULD BE ABLE TO AUTONOMOUSLY EXPLORE NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS, MEMORIZE LOCATIONS OF OBSTACLES OR OBJECTS, LEARN ABOUT OBJECTS, BUILD AND UPDATE AN ENVIRONMENT MAP, AND RETURN TO A SAFE LOCATION. ALL OF THESE TASKS CONSTITUTE TYPICAL ACTIVITIES EFFICIENTLY PERFORMED BY ANIMALS ON A DAILY BASIS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED NEUROMORPHIC APPLICATION THAT WILL TRANSLATE THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FUNCTIONALITIES INTO AN AUTONOMOUS ROBOT OR UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS). THE PHASE I EFFORT IMPLEMENTED A NEUROMORPHIC SYSTEM CAPABLE OF EXPLORING AN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT, AVOIDING OBSTACLES, AND RETURNING TO BASE FOR REFUEL/RECHARGE WITHOUT THE USE OF A GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (GNSS). THIS SYSTEM WAS SUCCESSFULLY TESTED IN A MARS-LIKE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND A SIMPLE ROBOT. LEVERAGING PHASE I RESULTS, THE PHASE II EFFORT WILL DEVELOP VISUAL PROCESSING BASED ON PASSIVE SENSORS IN ORDER TO FIND, IDENTIFY, LOCALIZE AND INTERACT WITH OBJECTS AND USE THIS INFORMATION TO ENHANCE NAVIGATION CAPABILITIES. NEURALA'S NEUROMORPHIC APPLICATION WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR HUMAN GUIDANCE THROUGH AN INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE.

IDEALLY, A ROBOT SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUSLY EXPLORING AND INTERACTING WITHIN AN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT RELYING ON HUMAN INPUT OR SUBOPTIMAL SENSORS. BEHAVIORS SUCH AS EXPLORATION OF UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTS, MEMORIZING LOCATIONS OF OBSTACLES OR OBJECTS, BUILDING AND UPDATING A REPRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND RETURNING TO A SAFE LOCATION, ARE ALL TASKS THAT CONSTITUTE TYPICAL ACTIVITIES EFFICIENTLY PERFORMED BY ANIMALS ON A DAILY BASIS. PHASE I OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS ON DESIGN OF AN ADAPTIVE ROBOTIC MULTI-COMPONENT NEURAL SYSTEM THAT CAPTURES THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL BRAIN AREAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PERCEPTUAL, COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL, AND MOTOR BEHAVIORS. THIS SYSTEM MAKES USE OF PASSIVE, POTENTIALLY UNRELIABLE SENSORS (ANALOGOUS TO ANIMAL VISUAL AND VESTIBULAR SYSTEMS) TO LEARN WHILE NAVIGATING UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS BUILD USABLE AND CORRECTABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF THESE ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT REQUIRING A GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (GNSS). IN PHASE I, NEURALA AND THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY NEUROMORPHICS LAB, WILL CONSTRUCT A VIRTUAL ROBOT, OR ANIMAT, TO BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. THE ANIMAT WILL USE PASSIVE SENSORS TO PERFORM A SPATIAL EXPLORATION TASK. THE ANIMAT WILL START EXPLORING FROM A RECHARGING BASE, AUTONOMOUSLY PLAN WHERE TO GO BASED ON PAST EXPLORATION AND ITS CURRENT MOTIVATION, DEVELOP AND CORRECT AN INTERNAL MAP OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE LOCATIONS OF OBSTACLES, SELECT THE SHORTEST PATH OF RETURN TO ITS RECHARGING BASE BEFORE BATTERY DEPLETION, THEN EXTRACT THE RESULTING EXPLORED MAP INTO A HUMAN-READABLE FORMAT. IN PHASE II NEURALA WILL ENHANCE AND TRANSLATE THE MODEL TO LOW-POWER NEUROMORPHIC HARDWARE AND COLLABORATE WITH IROBOT TO TEST THE MODEL IN A ROBOTICS PLATFORM.Aeronautics and Space Technology - Basic Research (AR11)2/13/122/14/13National Aeronautics and Space Administration$124,998 USD100% obligated

Neurala, Inc. Key Developments

Motorola Solutions and Neurala to Work Together on Intelligence for Cameras
Jul 17 17
Motorola Solutions announced that it will work with Neurala to develop intelligent cameras for public safety users. The goal is to enable police officers to more efficiently search for objects or persons of interest, such as missing children and suspects. The companies will work together to integrate Neurala’s AI capabilities with Motorola Solutions’ software and cameras, including its Si500 body-worn camera. The integration will create intelligent cameras that can learn “at the edge” and automatically search for persons or objects of interest – significantly reducing the time and effort required to find a missing child or suspicious object in environments that are often crowded or chaotic. Neurala’s “at the edge” learning capabilities help solve some of the biggest challenges that come with real-time applications of AI. Neurala’s patent-pending technology provides an alternative to lengthy training for the AI engine, so that, for example, the intelligent camera “learns” to identify the person or object of interest. This feature, known as incremental learning, also reduces the risk of “catastrophic forgetting,” which occurs when a neural network forgets its previous training. Incremental learning also enables enhanced accuracy and latency for real-time public safety applications of AI. Neurala’s technology enables AI applications to learn at the edge after their deployment,” Steinberg continued. “This can unlock new applications for public safety users. In the case of a missing child, imagine if the parent showed the child’s photo to a nearby police officer on patrol. The officer’s body-worn camera sees the photo, the AI engine ‘learns’ what the child looks like and deploys an engine to the body-worn cameras of nearby officers, quickly creating a team searching for the child. Neurala will initially work with Motorola Solutions to build a prototype that allows for real-time learning for a person of interest search. Motorola Solutions Venture Capital, the company’s strategic investment group, was a lead investor in Neurala’s Series A funding announced in January.

The underlying technology is based on research done with the Boston University Neuromorphics Lab and funded by NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The research projects include developing robot intelligence for use on Mars, where robots must operate independently because Earth-based communications are limited. Neurala is taking the work designed for Mars and is bringing it down to Earth.
Neurala is a graduate of the TechStars 2013 Boston start-up accelerator program and works closely with the Boston University Neuromorphics Lab, which studies biological intelligence and embeds the derived fundamental principles in bio-inspired computers and robots.

Product developers can significantly accelerate the deployment of AI applications without a team of Ph.D. researchers, an extensive evaluation of different tools or years of costly R&D with the Neurala Developers Program, announced today by Neurala.  Neurala makes The Neurala Brain, a deep learning neural networks platform that is making smart products like toys, cameras and self-driving cars more autonomous, interactive and useful.
The Neurala Developers Program has everything a software developer needs to integrate The Neurala Brain into a target application. It includes a set of C++ APIs, testing tools, code examples and a working program with source code. Mobile wrappers are provided for Android and iOS to make integration easier on those platforms.
The software behind the magic
Neurala’s neural network software—originally developed for NASA—uses a bio-inspired approach to mimic the way the human brain learns and analyzes its environment. This software enables a variety of smart products—from self-driving cars and industrial drones to toys, consumer electronics and smart cameras—to learn, adapt and interact in real time. For example, toys can learn to identify their owners, security cameras can identify specific threats, drones can learn how to diagnose problems at the tops of cell towers, saving humans considerable danger and drudgery, and self-driving cars can be safer and learn to avoid obstacles.
One significant differentiator of Neurala’s deep learning software is that it scales from embedded hardware to powerful servers. Neurala calls this an “Anywhere Brain.” By operating “on the edge” and locally on the device, toys can entertain without communicating personal information to a third party, and applications like self-driving cars need not rely on the internet—which can be slow or unavailable—to avoid accidents.
Neurala’s software development kit (SDK) supports industry-standard NVIDIA, ARM and Intel processors, so teams can develop for the processor that is best for their product instead of being forced to select a high-priced proprietary processor.
AI for all!
“The artificial intelligence capabilities we once saw as futuristic possibilities are becoming realities. Now anyone can easily integrate a deep learning neural network in an app,” said Massimiliano “Max” Versace, Neurala co-founder and CEO. “We’ve spent years developing The Neurala Brain so that a variety of devices can benefit from bio-inspired brainpower. As we make this technology available to developers for everyday projects, we look forward to witnessing the resulting proliferation of products that can learn, see and act more autonomously.”
Teal Drones is the first in the drone industry to bundle Neurala technology in every drone built, a powerful and unique differentiator. “The Neurala Brain is giving our drones autonomy and control that would not otherwise be possible,” said George Matus, founder and CEO of Teal Drones. “Neurala’s real-time, deep learning software is powerful and versatile—and we believe it will find many compelling applications in the hands of the larger developer community.”
Neurala: making AI easy
Building a drone, car or robot is difficult; building AI is even harder, with different skill sets and extensive resources required. Companies wishing to integrate AI into a product or service have historically faced a long and costly process that involves assembling a team, R&D, deploying, testing and optimizing. With the “zoo” of hardware platforms and software tools available, developers traditionally have found choosing the right fit difficult until after development and testing are done—often taking years and involving an investment of millions of dollars.
Neurala’s Developers Program eliminates the need for any of that. Neurala’s new offering allows developers to build and deploy their own AI “brain” immediately. The offering is C++-optimized for real-time control of machines and allows for:
·       Edge learning on-the-fly
·       Enhanced cloud learning
·       Both custom and off-the-shelf “brains”
·       Cloud post-processing
