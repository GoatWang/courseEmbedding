Our Roots
Our roots stem back more than twenty five years when Columbia Pacific Management (CPM) was founded by Daniel Baty. Throughout its existence CPM has delivered compelling investment results. In 2006, Columbia Pacific Management launched Columbia Pacific Advisors (CPA), an alternative investment platform specifically for the Baty family and a select number of outside investors.
Tapping into this proven experience, CPM and CPA saw a void in high net worth investing and formed Columbia Pacific Wealth Management (CPWM) in 2011. Columbia Pacific assembled a team of highly experienced professionals to create a comprehensive wealth management firm with a boutique feel. Building on its success, in 2015 CPWM acquired the Kibble & Prentice Private Investment Advisory Group, a talented wealth management team with experience spanning more than three decades.

CPCM, LLC (a/k/a Columbia Pacific Wealth Management “CPWM”) maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect its clients’ nonpublic personal information (“information”). Through this policy and its underlying procedures, CPWM attempts to secure the confidentiality of customer records and information and protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and information.
It is the policy of CPWM to restrict access to all current and former clients’ information (i.e., information and records pertaining to personal background, investment objectives, financial situation, tax information/returns, investment holdings, account numbers, account balances, etc.) to those employees and affiliated/nonaffiliated entities who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to the client. CPWM may disclose the client’s information if CPWM is: (1) previously authorized to disclose the information to individuals and/or entities not affiliated with CPWM, including, but not limited to the client’s other professional advisors and/or service providers (i.e., attorney, accountant, insurance agent, broker-dealer, investment adviser, account custodian, etc.); (2) required to do so by judicial or regulatory process; or (3) otherwise permitted to do so in accordance with the parameters of applicable federal and/or state privacy regulations. The disclosure of information contained in any document completed by the client for processing and/or transmittal by CPWM in order to facilitate the commencement, continuation, termination of a business relationship between the client and a nonaffiliated third party service provider (i.e., broker-dealer, investment adviser, account custodian, insurance company, etc.), including information contained in any document completed and/or executed by the client for CPWM (i.e., advisory agreement, client information form, etc.), shall be deemed as having been automatically authorized by the client with respect to the corresponding nonaffiliated third party service provider.
CPWM permits only authorized employees and affiliates who have signed a copy of CPWM’s Code of Ethics (or other document providing substantially similar terms) to have access to client information. Employees violating CPWM’s Code of Ethics will be subject to CPWM’s disciplinary process. Additionally, whenever CPWM hires other organizations to provide services to CPWM’s clients, CPWM require them to sign confidentiality agreements or their respective agreement will contain confidentiality provisions.

The transaction will enable Kirkland, WA-based Talyst to leverage Columbia Pacific's deep operating history and extensive network of leading domestic and international healthcare providers. 
"We are excited to make this investment in Talyst, whose innovation and best-in-class solutions have led the way in pharmacy automation and automated medication delivery," said Dan Baty, Co-Founder of Columbia Pacific Advisors.

"We are committed to leveraging the resources of this relationship to help health systems improve patient care and outcomes by revolutionizing the pharmacy automation space."
The transaction will result in the separation of Talyst's acute care and long-term care businesses – now Talyst Systems, LLC – from the 340B software business.  The two companies will continue to work closely together to best serve their joint customers and offer valuable solutions to healthcare systems of all sizes.
