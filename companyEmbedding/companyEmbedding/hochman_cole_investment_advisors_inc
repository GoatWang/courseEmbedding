The "Fiscal Cliff" Legislation: Key Provisions for Individuals







In December 2012, the president signed the “Fiscal Cliff” legislation into law, after being passed by the Senate and House of Representatives .  Even though the final resolutions of issues related to spending cuts and the debt ceiling were put off, the legislation did address and resolve most of the tax uncertainty that made year-end planning for 2012 so difficult.



The following are key provisions for individuals in the legislation:


1. Extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for those with taxable income below $450,000 (joint) or $400,000 (single). Taxable income above these levels will be subject to an income tax rate of 39.6%, up from the 2012 rate of 35%.


2. The income tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends remains at 15% for those with taxable income below $450,000 (joint) or $400,000 (single).  For those with income above these amounts, a rate of 20% will apply to long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.


3. Itemized deductions will be reduced by 3% of the excess of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) over $300,000 (joint) or $250,000 (single). However, itemized deductions can’t be reduced by more than 80%.


4. Personal exemptions will also be reduced for those with AGI in excess of $300,000 (joint) and $250,000 (single). The reduction is 2% for each $2,500 of AGI in excess of these threshold amounts. This means that exemptions are reduced to zero if AGI exceeds $425,000 (joint) or $375,000 (single).


5. The employee portion of the Social Security withholding tax increases from 4.2% to 6.2%. This increase also applies to those subject to the self-employment tax.


6. The estate tax exemption remains at $5 million. However the top estate tax rate increases from 35% to 40%.


7. The AMT exemption was increased to 2012 “patch” levels and the change was made permanent. 



In addition, the legislation includes permanent extensions to both the adoption and dependent care credits. Certain deductions were given two-year extensions including: the $250 deduction for teachers’ classroom expenses, the state sales tax deduction (in lieu of deducting state income taxes) and charitable donations of assets in an IRA account.



The legislation did not affect the Medicare tax surcharge on earned income or the 3.8% net investment income tax that applied to those with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) in excess of $250,000 (joint) or $200,000 (single).  These taxes were added by the Affordable Health Care Act and apply beginning of 2013.

Getting Off on the Right Foot in 2012





GETTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT IN 2012A look at some financial changes & the opportunities they may present.Every year brings some financial change, so here are some relevant changes relating to investment, tax and estate planning for 2012.Retirement plans. 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan annual contribution limits rise slightly to $17,000, and you can contribute an additional $5,500 to these accounts if you are 50 or older this year. IRA contribution levels are unchanged from 2011: the ceiling is $5,000, $6,000 if you will be 50 or older in 2012.1As you strive to contribute as much as you comfortably can to these accounts this year, you will probably notice some changes with the retirement plan at your workplace. In 2012, retirement plan sponsors (i.e., employers) will have to note all of the fees and expenses linked to the funds in the plan to plan participants. So if you have a 401(k) or 403(b), you may notice some differences in the disclosures on your statements and you will probably notice more information coming your way about fees. There is also a push in Washington, D.C. to have financial companies provide lifetime income illustrations on retirement plan account statements, projections of your expected monthly benefit at retirement age.2 Income taxes. Wealthy Americans are set to face greater income tax burdens in 2013, so 2012 may be the last year to take advantage of certain factors. For example, the top tax bracket in 2013 is slated to be at 39.6% instead of the current 35%. This year, capital gains and dividends will be taxed at 15% or less for everyone, 0% for those in the 10% and 15% tax brackets. In 2013, the qualified capital gains tax rate is scheduled to rise to 20% and qualified dividends will be taxed as ordinary income. So taking a little more income in 2012 could be smart.3In 2013, the wealthiest Americans are supposed to be hit with new Medicare taxes: a new 3.8% levy on unearned income (such as capital gains, income from real estate, dividends and interest) and a new 0.9% tax or earned income. So next year, the truly wealthy could effectively face in the neighborhood of 45% federal taxes.3 Additionally, the IRS is planning to limit itemized deductions for upper-income taxpayers in 2013. A phase-out will also apply for the personal exemption deduction.3Estate & gift taxes. At the end of 2012, some very nice estate tax breaks could sunset. Barring action by Congress, 2013 could see a 20% leap in the federal estate tax rate from 35% to 55%. The individual estate tax exclusion (currently $5.12 million) is scheduled to be reduced to $1 million.3As we have unified gift and estate tax rates, those numbers and percentages also apply to gift taxes. That is, from 2012 to 2013 top federal gift tax rate is set to go from 35% to 55% and the lifetime gift tax exemption amount is scheduled to fall $4,120,000 per individual to $1 million. The annual gift tax exemption is $13,000 per recipient in 2012; there is an exemption limit for qualifying educational and medical payments. If you want to gift relatives or friends, you may want to avoid procrastinating for another very good reason: when you make such a gift early in a year, the recipient will gain both the principal and any appreciation tied to the gifted asset in that year.3,4Speaking of gifts, we said goodbye to charitable IRA gifts in 2011. The IRA charitable rollover, a boon to non-profits and a handy tax deduction option for taxpayers older than age 70½, was not extended into 2012, not even temporarily as a sweetener to the payroll tax extension bill. There is hope it will be back. Two bills have been introduced in Congress with that goal, one sponsored by Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and another by Rep. Wally Herger (R-CA) and Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). The proposed legislation would let IRA owners start making charitable IRA gifts at age 59½ and remove the $100,000 limit on the rollovers.5 The limits on the generation-skipping transfer tax could change, too: assuming the Bush-era tax cuts do sunset, the GSTT rate would jump from 35% this year to 55% in 2013, with the GSTT exemption falling from $5,120,000 per person this year to roughly $1.3 million per person next year.3So given all these changes, it would be wise to plan early in 2012 as you strive to start the year off on the right foot. You have until April 17 to file your federal return, but you can plan now.If you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment,Hochman & Baker Investment Advisors, Inc. may be reached at 847-559-0180 or info@hochmanandbaker.com.Citations.1 - www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=96461,00.html [10/20/11]2 - www.marketwatch.com/story/retirement-plan-changes-coming-in-2012-2011-12-29 [12/29/11] 3 - www.sbnonline.com/2012/01/how-to-approach-tax-and-estate-planning-opportunities-for-2012/?full=1 [1/3/12]4 - advisorone.com/2012/01/06/10-tax-tips-for-advisors-in-2012 [1/6/12]5 - www.northjersey.com/news/business/business_opinion/136217658_Payroll_tax_cut_benefits_charities.html [12/25/11]

HOW LTC INSURANCE CAN HELP PROTECT YOUR ASSETS





Create a pool of healthcare dollars that will grow in any market.How will you pay for long term care? The sad fact is that most people don’t know the answer to that question. But a solution is available.As baby boomers leave their careers behind, long term care insurance will become very important in their financial strategies. The reasons to get an LTC policy after age 50 are very compelling. Your premium payments buy you access to a large pool of money which can be used to pay for long term care costs. By paying for LTC out of that pool of money, you can preserve your retirement savings and income. The cost of assisted living or nursing home care alone could motivate you to pay the premiums. Genworth Financial conducts a respected annual Cost of Care Survey to gauge the price of long term care in the U.S. The 2010 report found that:• In 2010, the median annual cost of a private room in a nursing home is $75,190 or $206 per day – $14,965 more than it was in 2005. • A private one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility has a median cost of $3,185 a month – which is 12% higher than it was in 2009.• The median payment to a non-Medicare certified, state-licensed home health aide in 2010 is $19 per hour, up 2.7% from 2009.1The most recent (2009) estimate of LTC costs from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was even higher than the Genworth survey - $219 per day for a private room in a nursing home, or $79,935 per year.2 Can you imagine spending an extra $30-80K out of your retirement savings in a year? What if you had to do it for more than one year? Let’s take that $79,935 figure from the government and factor in inflation. At 5% inflation, that private room will cost you $130,206 per year by 2019 and $212,091 annually by 2029. AARP notes that approximately 60% of people over age 65 will require some kind of long term care during their lifetimes.3Why procrastinate? The earlier you opt for LTC coverage, the cheaper the premiums. This is why many people purchase it before they retire. Those in poor health or over the age of 80 are frequently ineligible for coverage.What it pays for. Some people think LTC coverage just pays for nursing home care. That’s inaccurate. It can pay for a wide variety of nursing, social, and rehabilitative services at home and away from home, for people with a chronic illness or disability or people who just need assistance bathing, eating or dressing.4Choosing a DBA. That stands for Daily Benefit Amount - the maximum amount that your LTC plan will pay per day for care in a nursing home facility. You can choose a Daily Benefit Amount when you pay for your LTC coverage, and you can also choose the length of time that you may receive the full DBA on a daily basis. The DBA typically ranges from a few dozen dollars to hundreds of dollars. Some of these plans offer you “inflation protection” at enrollment, meaning that every few years, you will have the chance to buy additional coverage and get compounding - so your pool of money can grow. The Medicare misconception. Too many people think Medicare will pick up the cost of long term care. Medicare is not long term care insurance. Medicare will only pay for the first 100 days of nursing home care, and only if 1) you are getting skilled care and 2) you go into the nursing home right after a hospital stay of at least 3 days. Medicare also covers limited home visits for skilled care, and some hospice services for the terminally ill. That’s all.3Now, Medicaid can actually pay for long term care – if you are destitute. But are you willing to wait until you are broke for a way to fund long term care?Why not look into this? You may have heard that LTC insurance is expensive compared with some other forms of policies. But the annual premiums (about as much as you’d spend on a used car from the late 1990s) are nothing compared to real-world LTC costs.5 Ask your financial or insurance professional about some of the LTC choices you can explore – while many Americans have life, health and disability insurance, that’s not the same thing as long term care coverage.Have any questions?

INVESTOR ALERT – THE NEW IRS REPORTING RULESThey affect anyone with a brokerage account.Are you going to purchase stocks in 2011? If your answer to that question is “yes’, there’s an important IRS rule change you should know about. If you buy a stock in 2011, your broker must report the gain or loss when you sell it. In fact, this will be true for the following investment classes as of the following dates:Individual stocks you buy after January 1, 2011Mutual fund shares you buy after January 1, 2012Bonds, options & other securities you buy after January 1, 2013 1,2 Prior to 2011, reporting the gain or loss triggered by the sale of an investment was your responsibility – but the IRS wasn’t satisfied with that.It’s all about the cost basis. To properly tax your investment when it is sold, the IRS has to know what you initially paid for it. In financial jargon, this acquisition price is known as the cost basis.It isn’t always easy to figure the cost basis – factors like splits, mergers, reinvestment of dividends and inherited or gifted investments can make things hazy. The IRS simply doesn’t want to rely on your math anymore – federal government studies estimate that the agency loses up to $25 billion in tax revenue each year because of cost basis errors.1 Your broker will send Form 1099-B to the IRS. Each sale of a stock bought in 2011 will generate a 1099-B. You will get a copy; the IRS will get a copy. On that 1099-B form, the gain or loss will be characterized as long-term or short-term.2The key here is to make sure your broker uses the accounting method you prefer as they report gains or losses. Most brokerages report individual securities using the FIFO method, as that is the IRS default method.3 FIFO is an acronym for “first in, first out” – that is, the shares bought first are the shares sold first. With the FIFO method, you end up selling your cheapest shares first. In a down market, that’s okay – but in a rising market, many investors favor the specific ID method, in which they identify specific shares they want to sell. Using this method enables you to sell your highest-cost shares first, which can be tax-wise. More details worth noting. According to the Wall Street Journal, the new reporting rules will also apply to REITs, foreign stocks and foreign ETFs classified as stock in 2011. In 2012, the reporting rules will apply to most ETFs and DRIPs in addition to mutual funds. In 2013, the reporting requirements may also apply to derivatives and partnerships.1 Remember, this does not apply to shares & investments bought before 2011. You will still have to personally track the cost basis of these investments and report the realized gains and losses to the IRS. By the way, these new IRS reporting rules do not apply to tax-sheltered investment accounts such as 529 plans and IRAs.1Have any questions?

LOOKING AT THE NEW ESTATE TAX LAWSA rundown of recent changes.In 2011, families and their financial, tax and legal consultants can at last plan estates with a degree of certainty. Thanks to the Tax Relief Act of 2010, we now have the lowest estate tax rate in 80 years, with some new rules to be aware of, and some very interesting choices and options affecting estate planning.1The federal estate tax is now 35% with a $5 million individual exemption. This is true for 2011 and 2012 – after 2012, estate tax rates could change.2The new $5 million exemption is portable. That is, executors have the option to transfer an unused $5 million individual estate tax exemption (upon the death of one spouse) to a surviving spouse. So with this new portability, a married couple could potentially transfer up to $10 million of assets without incurring federal estate tax.3In 2011, estates of those who passed away in 2010 may be taxed under the new rules or the 2010 rules. That’s right, an executor has a choice. The executor can elect to:Subject the estate to the 2011 federal rules (35% estate tax, $5 million estate exemption, stepped-up basis for appreciated assets per IRC rule 1014)Subject the estate to the 2010 federal rules (0% estate tax and the $1.3 million modified carryover basis for appreciated assets in the estate, which becomes $3 million for assets passing to a surviving spouse).3,4,5Estates worth more than $5 million will have to consider many factors to determine which choice will give them less of a tax burden.The federal gift tax exemption is set at $5 million through 2012. This is a fantastic tax break. Wealthy taxpayers can now plan to transfer significantly greater amounts of wealth within their lifetimes without triggering gift tax. This $5 million exemption is individual and portable, meaning that couples could potentially gift up to $10 million to heirs.2,5The annual gift tax exclusion is again $13,000 in 2011, so one taxpayer may gift up to $13,000 each to an unlimited number of individuals this year with the lifetime exclusion of $5 million in mind. (Those gifts can include tuition and payments for medical care.)2Charitable IRA donations are again permitted. This isn’t an estate tax law per se, but it factors into estate planning and it is certainly worth noting. Charitable IRA rollovers are back in 2011 (we don’t know yet if they will be around in 2012). There may be less financial incentive for families to make these rollovers given the much higher gift and estate tax exclusion this year, but others will act on their altruism.6,7The charitable IRA rollover allows an IRA owner age 70½ or older to gift up to a total of $100,000 in IRA assets to one or more qualified charities or non-profit organizations (a move that can count toward his or her annual RMD). It has to be a direct transfer – the gift must pass directly from an IRA sponsor to the charity. The IRA accountholder doesn’t get a tax deduction, but he or she can potentially bypass the income tax on the distribution.6Charitable IRA gifts made in January 2011 can count for 2010. The new law says that if you make a charitable IRA transfer in January 2011, you can elect to report the transfer on your 2010 federal return. Additionally, you are free to make another IRA charitable rollover of up to $100,000 at some other point in 2011 for the benefit of your 2011 federal return.7The GST is back. The generation-skipping transfer tax was 0% in 2010, but it returns at 35% in 2011. The GST exemption is set at $5 million for 2011 and it will be inflation-indexed for 2012.5,8In light of these interesting developments, it might be time to review your estate planning strategy.Have any questions?

How Long to Keep Those Documents?This is the time of year when we all start thinking about income taxes. As you wade through your piles of receipts and various statements, you may question which documents need to be saved and for how long. Although there is no one hard and fast rule, there are some guidelines which you can follow that may free up a little space in your file cabinets.As a general rule, the IRS suggests retaining records for 7 years following the year in which expenses are claimed on your tax return. The standard IRS audit only goes back 3 years. However, the IRS has six years to challenge your return if it seems you under reported your gross income by 25% or more. If you file a fraudulent return or no return, you should hold onto any records for 7 years.What about the actual tax returns? The IRS encourages you to keep federal tax returns until the period of limitations expires. This is the time period you have to claim a credit or refund or the time frame they have to levy additional taxes on you. State returns should be saved for the same time period. In most cases, you are safe to toss them after 7 years.If you plan to claim a credit or refund after you file, then you should retain relevant tax records for 3 years. If you claim a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction, you should keep related records for 7 years. Employment tax records should be held for 4 years after the date the tax becomes due or paid, whichever is later.For most investments and banking statements, the year-end statement is the most important. If you have any investment liquidations that generated capital gains or losses, you will want to keep the statements related to those transactions. Investment purchase information should be kept at least until the cost basis and purchase date is reflected on your account statements. Those figures will be used in future gain/loss calculations. Real estate documents, including closing statements, mortgage information, and expenses incurred to improve the property should be kept as long as you own the property. Once the property is sold, keep documents showing the deed recording and the mortgage pay-off receipt. It is also advisable to hold onto those receipts for 7 years after you sell, exchange or liquidate any real property.If you make any contributions, receive distributions, or rollover any IRAs or other qualified plans, you’ll need to document those transactions. The IRS wants to make sure they receive any taxes due and will penalize violations. Keep your annual 401(k) statements and any Form 8606 (nondeductible contributions to traditional IRAs), Form 5498 (contribution information), or Form 1099-R (distributions) you receive. While Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, you need to keep those records until you are 59 ½ and have had the account for at least 5 years.If you anticipate needing to apply for Medicaid, you’ll want to keep fairly complete financial history documentation. Medicaid has a five-year "lookback" period in many states, so to qualify for aid you have to prove that you didn’t transfer any assets except those specifically allowed. Medical records and medical insurance documents should be held onto for about 5 years from when services are rendered. If the medical expenses are claimed on your taxes, however, you’ll want to keep them for 7 years following the year they are claimed.Life insurance policy information should be kept for the life of the policy plus 3 years.Small business owners will likely need to keep any payroll documents for at least 7 years. Should there be a lawsuit or a legal dispute involving your company or one of its employees, a detailed financial history would be helpful.As a reminder, it’s a good idea to shred any documents you’re disposing that have personal information on them (social security numbers, active account numbers, etc.). And while you’re sorting through all your files, who knows – you may uncover some new projects that need attending to, like updating your Powers of Attorney or completing a household inventory for your insurance.If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call at (847-559-0180) or send us an email (info@hochmanandbaker.com).

IRA Consolidation: Are You Missing Out on a Chance to Make Your Life Simpler?





Are you one of the many Americans who has several retirement accounts? Were some of these rolled over from previous employers and held in a variety of places? Have you had years where you almost forgot about one or two of these accounts?Consider consolidating your current IRA accounts into a single account with your financial adviser. You’ll find that eliminating multiple accounts may reduce fees charged by institutions for holding these IRAs, makes monitoring performance easier, and allows your financial adviser to take a more comprehensive approach to managing your portfolio. In addition, a consolidated account will make matters much clearer when you begin to take your Required Minimum Distributions.Remember to also speak with your financial adviser about any 401(k) plans you may still have with former employers. These can be rolled into your IRA which may provide  many more options for investing. As a self-directed IRA, you will have access to a multitude of investment choices, whereas most company plans offer less than twenty. These additional options allow you to choose how you invest your money based on your individual preferences, i.e. risk level, expense costs, exposure to specific industries, time frames, etc. While company 401(k) plans have strong selling points, such as company matching provisions, when you are no longer working for that company, they vanish. The benefits of IRAs are numerous and are especially favorable to the alternative of keeping a plan with a former employer. Not only can a self-directed IRA be more easily coordinated with your other financial holdings, but your beneficiaries have more flexibility with an IRA. Beneficiaries of IRAs usually have the option to stretch receipt of distributions over their lifetimes (and consequently the corresponding taxes) but most company plans do not allow this option. When stretch IRAs are not allowed, a beneficiary will be required to take a lump sum distribution and pay income tax on the entire amount in that tax year. This can be a tremendous burden and reduces the net inheritance considerably. Also, if you are currently contributing to a 401(k) plan, another option for you to consider is taking an in-service distribution. Although limited by the provisions of the plan, these in-service distributions allow you to roll money from your company’s plan into your self-directed IRA which will provide you with more investment options for that qualified money. It’s common for individuals to have too heavy a weighting of their employer’s stock in the 401(k) plan. While company loyalty is admirable, it is often wise to roll a portion of that holding out of the plan into an IRA and reallocate to reduce risk. It’s worth your time to think about consolidating your IRAs. Talk to your financial adviser and make sure you’ve considered your alternatives.This information is not meant as tax or legal advice.

529 College Savings Plans





 Have you heard about the study conducted by the Department Agriculture, Expenditures on Children by Families? They have been tracking the cost of raising a child since 1960 and report that a two-parent, middle-income family can expect to spend $221,190 (they estimate from $11,610 to $13,480 per year for 17 years) to raise a child born in 2008. This figure is not adjusted for inflation, nor does it include any college costs!     With the costs for raising a child so high, a lot of people wonder how they can possibly afford to save money for their child’s education. Even if you can’t save a lot of money, your children or grandchildren can still benefit greatly from a college savings plan. One of the more popular ways to save for college is a 529 college savings plan. These savings plans are managed by investment firms or state government agencies and provide a tax advantaged way to save for higher education.    A 529 savings plan is flexible—you can open a 529 plan for anyone (a child, a grandchild, a friend) and there are no income limits. You can contribute up to $13,000 ($26,000 for married couples) a year without gift tax consequences. Plans are administered by individual states, but investors may choose any plan, regardless of where they live. Also, you can pay for educational expenses at any eligible institution, not just schools in the state of the plan.    The tax advantages are the major draw for 529 plans. The main tax advantages are that the principal grows tax-deferred and the distributions for qualified educational expenses are exempt from tax. Qualified educational expenses include tuition, fees, book, supplies, and equipment required for study at any accredited college, university, or vocational school. (The money can be used for room and board as long as the beneficiary is at least a half-time student.) If a distribution from a 529 plan is not used for a qualified education expenses, then it is subject to income tax and possibly a 10% early distribution penalty. Though contributions are not deductible for federal income tax purposes, many states provide state income tax deductions.     To find out more about saving for college, check out this website that has tools for calculating college costs and more information on 529 and other college savings plans: http://www.savingforcollege.com/    To see the study Expenditures on Children by Families by the Department of Agriculture, visit:  http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/CRC/crc2008.pdf    This information is not meant as tax or legal advice. Please consult your financial advisor for more information.  Have any questions? Feel free to give us a call (847-559-0180) or send us an email (info@hochmanandbaker.com).

Roth IRA Conversions in 2010





What’s New for 2010Starting in 2010, the $100,000 modified AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) limit for conversions to Roth IRAs is eliminated. Also, married taxpayers filing separate returns can now convert amounts into a Roth IRA. For conversions in 2010, any amounts required to be included in income are included in income in equal amounts in 2011 and 2012. You can elect to include the entire amount in income in 2010.Benefits of ConversionThe main difference between traditional IRA and Roth IRAs is the way in which the contributions and distributions are taxed. Contributions to traditional IRAs are tax deductible; however you must pay taxes on the distributions. Contributions to Roth IRAs are made on an after-tax basis and, consequently, you do not have to pay taxes on that money again. Distributions are tax free after age 59 ½ (as long as you have had the Roth IRA for five years). This is an attractive option for young investors as they will mostly likely be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they are now. However, Roth IRAs are not just for the young! Older investors can benefit from conversion to a Roth, especially if they do not have an immediate need for their IRA assets. If you name your spouse as the beneficiary of your Roth IRA, your spouse can treat his/her inherited IRA as their own and he/she will not be required to take withdrawals. This provides an opportunity for further compounding for the rest of your spouse’s life. Then, your spouse’s beneficiary, a child or grandchild for example, and he/she can then take withdrawals according to their life expectancy. All the while, the assets continue to compound tax free!Note: If you made after-tax contributions to your traditional IRA, then that portion of the total contributions can be distributed tax-free. In the case of a conversion, the tax on the IRA assets would be solely on the portion of the before-tax contributions.Conversion DrawbacksA conversion from a traditional to a Roth IRA is a taxable event. You can pay taxes on the conversion amount out of the IRA or with outside funds. However, if you are under 59 ½ paying the tax from the IRA would result in a 10% penalty. The good news, as mentioned above, is that you can divide the taxes between your 2011 and 2012 tax returns. Consult Your Financial AdvisorBefore you arrange for any rollover or conversion, it is a good idea to consult a financial advisor. Each person’s financial circumstances are different and any tax consequences should be fully understood before any action is taken. This information is not meant as tax or legal advice. Please consult your financial advisor for more information.Have any questions? Feel free to give us a call (847-559-0180) or send us an email (info@hochmanandbaker.com).

	Investment Philosophy : Hochman Cole Investment Advisors, Inc.















































































Investment Philosophy














Consistency, Commitment and Research
At Hochman Cole Investment Advisors, we believe that no single investment strategy will outperform the overall market every year.  However, a diversified investment approach combined with a disciplined strategy has greater potential to outperform over time.  You can count on us to always:  
Focus on the long term:  Chasing returns is a formula for failure.  With a clinical approach, the frequent ups and downs of the markets are less likely to disturb you, much less influence your portfolio decisions.  

Create a diversified portfolio:  The highly customized portfolio that we build for you will be designed using our own research and analytics.  We believe that no two clients are exactly the same in terms of their investment goals or financial challenges.  Each portfolio ends up reflecting the individual client and is specific to his or her needs.  Your portfolio will be diversified across a broad spectrum of investment products that may include stocks, bonds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), mutual funds and private money managers, depending on your personal goals.  

Maintain diligent oversight:  Markets change.  Companies change.  Circumstances change.  What may have been a good investment a year ago may no longer fit your investment needs.  We track the progress of your portfolio’s performance toward reaching your investment goals, periodically rebalancing and making new recommendations.  You trust us to watch the markets and analyze how developments are affecting your portfolios.
