Evelyn V. Moreno







﻿














Evelyn Moreno focuses her practice on sophisticated gift and estate tax planning and she advises personal representatives of estates and trustees of trusts. She serves as trustee of several trusts for clients and works collaboratively with other firm personnel in the trust, tax and investment groups to provide tax planning and investment advice. She counsels nonprofit organizations with respect to tax and governance matters, and she has extensive experience in the reformation and termination of charitable trusts.
What do you focus on?
Much of my work involves counseling clients and providing solutions to minimize gift and estate taxes. Recently I designed a trust for a married couple to take advantage of their combined gift tax exemptions using closely held stock. With a valuation discount on the initial gift and a later liquidity event, the leveraged gift resulted in significant value passing to the trust beneficiaries without additional gift tax.
Serving as Trustee
With over 30 years of experience as an estate planning lawyer, my clients value my judgment and years of experience and frequently ask me to serve as trustee of their own trust accounts and trusts that they establish for family members. This aspect of my practice is particularly rewarding because clients have placed their trust in me and are confident that I will carry out their wishes, be a good steward of their wealth, and be a trusted advisor to their families.
Probate Court Practice
I counsel personal representatives and family members in connection with the probate of estates and the myriad issues that must be addressed upon the death of a family member. I work collaboratively with our team of experienced paralegals and trust administrators in all aspects of estate administration, from the initial probate proceedings in court to the filing of estate tax returns and giving advice and guidance on estate tax audits. I also counsel clients in contested matters related to estates and trusts and work closely with colleagues in the Litigation group to provide seamless advice and cohesive litigation strategy. Finally, I have extensive experience modifying and terminating charitable trusts.
What do you see on the horizon?
I’m thinking about the income, gift and estate tax planning opportunities presented by the wealth of the baby boomers as their generation embarks on retirement, and the estate and gift tax issues faced by their children and grandchildren who will inherit from them.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCR (NASDAQ:NCR CORP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
