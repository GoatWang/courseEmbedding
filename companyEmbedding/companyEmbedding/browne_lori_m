Lori M. Browne






 


 








Lori M. Browne | General Counsel - FairPay Solutions Inc.






 


FIRST JOB: I worked as a candy striper at the local hospital starting at age 13. My parents insisted that I never work during the school year, but that I always have a full-time job during the summers, starting at age 13.
WHY LAW: When I was 7 years old growing up in Austin, a friend of my parents was going to law school as a career change, and he started talking to me about it one day. After several discussions, he ended up taking me to UT Law School to sit in on a class (which the professor generously allowed), and I knew I wanted to go to law school. I continued to be fascinated by the law and years later ended up at the same school. I like best about being a lawyer the fact that you can solve problems and decode for your clients something that seems very complicated but is actually quite sensible.
HOW LONG IN CURRENT ROLE: Two and a half years.
CORPORATE LAWYER MISCONCEPTIONS: That we are arrogant or unwilling to answer questions. I have had numerous employees tell me that they never felt comfortable asking a lawyer a question (even if it was necessary to the business) until I came along because they thought the lawyer was too busy, or their question was too “dumb.” I don’t believe there are dumb questions — I strongly believe we are in a client-service business, especially in the corporate world.
SUCCESS STRATEGIES: Hard work, ownership of my clients’ problems, and seeking to understand the entire business so as to enable me to solve spot issues and avoid or solve problems.
CAREER DEFINING MOMENT: Getting my company ready for and participating in a sale of the business. I felt it was a tremendous accomplishment that benefited my client and presented enormous opportunity for the future of the business.
PROUD MOMENT: I am most proud of having put together and organized a top-notch department of talented people who are focused on delivering excellent legal advice and quality service to our internal clients, which allows the company to deliver an excellent product to its customers. We take ownership of our clients’ problems and make sure that they rest easy.

WHAT PEERS SAY: I’m known for my ability to put other people at ease, my ability to be calm and think clearly in a crisis. I always look for ways to give positive reinforcement to co-workers.




 


ADMIRED MENTOR: My greatest professional mentor has been Ralph Miller, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met and also the most full of integrity. Some of the most important lessons I learned from Ralph are to strip down a problem and properly frame the important questions, to think creatively in solving legal problems and to seek out and properly value the opinions of others on your team, regardless of their roles.
PERSONAL BUSINESS MOTTO: Pay attention! To the big picture, to the details and, most of all, to people. Paying attention and staying focused make the difference between mediocrity and greatness.
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK: Given our company’s focuses, we should be relatively unaffected by impending health care reform, so I am very optimistic regarding the company’s position in the market. That said, in a heavily regulated industry like health care, we lawyers are always concerned about potential legislative and regulatory activity and need to stay vigilant in that regard.
CAREER GUIDANCE: The best thing about being a corporate attorney is the intimacy you gain with the client. You know all the parts of the business and can see it from the 50,000-foot perspective. This intimacy substantially increases your effectiveness as an attorney, because you are able to see and understand the impact of certain courses of action in a way that outside counsel cannot appreciate.
BEST ADVICE RECEIVED: Always be able to look yourself in the mirror.
FREE-TIME PASSIONS: Family, reading, travel, good wine and food.
GETTING ONLINE: I don’t Twitter. I read Lexology, The New York Times and the Lamplighter School’s site.
IF POSSIBLE, WHICH REAL OR FICTIONAL ATTORNEY WOULD YOU BE? Denny Crane from “Boston Legal,” because, though insane, he has more fun than any lawyer I know, and he can get away with anything.
