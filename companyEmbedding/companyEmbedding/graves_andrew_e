He schedules them one or two a day so he doesn't rush to do them. I hated I had to wait 2 weeks for an appointment, but he is available by cell phone to call in meds or answer your questions.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Andrew Graves has the following 5 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Diagnostic Radiology
    Radiologists help doctors get a closer look at what’s happening inside your body. If your primary care doctor wants to investigate your symptoms further, they may refer you to a radiologist to get an ultrasound or x-ray. Some radiologists specialize in mammography and breast imaging, which is who you see when you need a mammogram. A Radiologist can also determine if bones are broken or fractured after any kind of accident.


    Radiologists are trained to perform MRIs and CT scans, both of which are used to determine the presence of diseases or disorders and help your doctor properly diagnose you. They can detect anything from tumors, bleeding and infections to bone and muscle disorders.
