About PayRange

On a Mission to Make Vending Profitable
PayRange is a company of inquisitive minds. We live and breathe innovation. Our culture revolves around being creative and conscientious. Ambitious and loyal. We are visionaries, believers, problem solvers. We exist to give vending operators the tools to get the most out of their business not only through innovative technology, but by listening, paying attention to market trends, and transforming a vending transaction into a frictionless experience.
We skate to where the puck will be, not where it has been. We are taking the vending industry to the next level, and then the next one after that. We are committed to always searching out new ways to improve the industry, not only through using technology to its fullest, but by creating technology where none exists. From the top of the organization to the bottom, our mission is deeply engrained. We share the same goals and hold the same beliefs. We strive to give consumers what they want, and operators what they need to thrive. We succeed not with the release of an innovative product, but when we make vending profitable.
