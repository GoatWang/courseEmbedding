History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

Item 4.                                                         Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 of the Statement is amended and supplemented as follows:
 
Silverback Subscription Agreement
 
On November 27, 2016, Riverstone Silverback Holdings, L.P. (the Riverstone Subscriber) entered into a subscription agreement (the SB Subscription Agreement) with the Issuer, pursuant to which the Riverstone Subscriber, a subsidiary of  Riverstone REL, agreed to purchase up to approximately $400 million in shares of (i) Class A Common Stock, at a purchase price of $14.54 per share, subject to adjustment as described below (the Class A Shares), and (ii) the Issuers convertible Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $3,635 per share (or $14.54 per share on an as-converted basis), subject to adjustment as described below (the Series B Shares and, together with the Class A Shares, the SB Subscription Shares), plus up to an additional approximately $100 million in shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock at the same respective purchase prices set forth above.
 
If the number of Class A Shares to be issued to the Riverstone Subscriber, together with any additional shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued to finance the acquisition of Silverback Exploration, LLC and Silverback Operating, LLC by Centennial Resource Production, LLC (the Acquisition), would exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock, then the Riverstone Subscriber will purchase a number of Class A Shares such that the 19.9% limitation will not be exceeded and will purchase its remaining commitment in Series B Shares.  In the event Centennial determines to finance any portion of the Acquisition by issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to one or more additional purchasers at a per share price less than the price payable by the Riverstone Subscriber, then the Riverstone Subscribers purchase price will be correspondingly reduced to the lowest per share price to be paid by any such additional purchaser.
 
Riverstone Subscriber has assigned its rights under the SB Subscription Agreement to Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US, pursuant to which the SB Subscription Shares will be purchased by Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US pro rata in proportion to their limited partnership interests in Riverstone Centennial.
 
The foregoing description of the SB Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to this Schedule 13D, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Riverstone Centennial Distribution
 
On December 15, 2016, Riverstone Centennial disposed of all of its shares of Class A Common Stock in a pro rata distribution to all of its limited partners. As a result, REL US, Riverstone Non-ECI and Riverstone QB Holdings, as the limited partners of Riverstone Centennial, each became the record holder of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock as set forth herein.
