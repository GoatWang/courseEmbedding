Neelie Kroes  Statement on Microsoft Fine, Q & A - transcript






            Wednesday, February 27 2008 @ 02:35 PM EST
        




	
Sean Daly took the time to transcribe the Neelie Kroes statement to the press and the Q & A afterward, from the video regarding the Microsoft fine,  announced earlier today. Thank you, Sean.  However, for anything that matters, go by the video. This is not an official transcript, and although we strive for accuracy, we can't guarantee it.  If anyone notices any mistakes, please let me know, so we can perfect it. It is absolutely fascinating.  My favorite part is her promise that consumers can rely upon it that they will have a choice.******************************* Jonathan Todd:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is here to talk to you about the decision taken this morning by the Commission on Microsoft. After her introductory remarks, we'd of course be very pleased to take your questions. [00:38] Neelie Kroes: Good morning everybody. Today the European Commission has imposed a substantial fine -- to be precise  899 million euros -- on Microsoft for its non-compliance up until the 22nd October of 2007 with its obligations under the Commission's March 2004 Decision, as you are aware, to provide interoperability information on reasonable terms. Today's decision finds that, prior to the 22nd of October 2007, Microsoft charged unreasonable prices for access to indispensable interoperability information. In plain English, this is to say that Microsoft continued to abuse its powerful market position [?] our March 2004 decision requiring it to change that practice. Microsoft continued to stifle innovation. How? By charging other companies prohibitive royalty rates for the essential information they needed to offer software products to computer users around the world. Well, charging such an unreasonable prices effectively rendered the offer of information pointless. And Microsoft's behavior did not just harm a few individuals or a handful of big companies; directly and indirectly, this had negative effects on millions of offices in companies and governments around the world. By the way, it gives me no pleasure to be here again announcing such a fine, nor to see that a company flouted the law when it had many opportunities to choose other courses of action. But given the nature of Microsoft's non-compliance, considering both its effects and its duration, today's fine is proportionate and is necessary. There are lessons that I hope Microsoft and any other company contemplating similar illegal action, will learn.Talk, as you know, is cheap; flouting the rules is expensive, so to say. We don't want talk and promises, we want compliance. If you flout the rules you will be caught, and it will cost you dear. This is by the way the third time in four years that we have had to impose fines or penalty payments on Microsoft. The first fine as you remember was for the abuse itself, everything up until March 2004. Then, the Commission had to impose a penalty payment in July 2006 for the non-delivery of complete and accurate interoperability information. And that was the first time that a penalty payment for non-compliance with a Commission decision had been necessary in fifty years of EC Competition Law. And finally today's penalty payment for unreasonable royalty rates up until October 2007. That the Commission has been forced to levy these three fines reflects a clear disregard [by] Microsoft of its legal obligations. The Commission's fine is a reasonable response to a series of quite unreasonable actions, so to say. Microsoft has gone from insisting on charging a 2.98% royalty for non-patented interoperability information to charging a flat fee of 10,000 euros for the same information. Finally, after three years of illegal behavior, it appears that Microsoft has come into compliance with the 2004 decision. Today's decision and penalty payment are about the 2004 Decision only and are not about any of Microsoft's other business practices.And I must stress, ladies and gentlemen, that distinction in the clearest possible terms.  And you will of course be aware that the Commission opened two antitrust inquiries in January looking at several of Microsoft's other practices. And as you are aware one concerns interoperability information across a broad range of products, including Microsoft's Office suite and a number of its server products. And the other concerns tying of Internet Explorer and other separate software products with the Microsoft PC operating system. Those investigations are separate and continuing, and I can offer no comment until the investigation is complete. But you are not expecting any comment on that one.  As always, we will take into account any changes that Microsoft makes to its business practices that are relevant to those investigations. We take positive changes to business practices very seriously. But again, and I stress that a press release in itself, such as that issued by Microsoft last week on interoperability principles, does not necessarily equal a change in a business practice. And if change is needed -- and as I say, I have reached no conclusion on that -- then the change will need to be in the market, not in the rhetoric. We do have some experience on that. To finish, I think it is important to share a little insight into our consistent approach to illegal behavior. It's not my job to tell people or to tell companies what to buy, but it is my job to ensure they have a choice about what they can buy. Competition policy is about making sure that people and companies have the right to choose. And when people and companies are given that right to choose, then markets deliver so much more -- and that is why I am passionate about making markets work better. And today's decision sends, again, a strong signal that consumers can expect choice in Europe and can expect the European Commission to fight for their right to choice. Thank you.  [08:36] Jonathan Todd: Thank you, Commissioner. We'll be taking questions on this decision of this morning. [08:45] Q: Commissioner, you said yourself that the fine is quite substantial, it's nearly at twice as high as the fine in the procedure itself. Could you please elaborate on how the fine was calculated? Did it depend upon the time between the second fine and the third fine, or is that completely independent of that? [09:16] Neelie Kroes: [The] answer is yes, and if you take into account 899 million euros, and if you take into account 488 days that this was done, then it's not that difficult to make your calculation. By the way, I still think that we made a very reasonable amount of money out of this penalty. It is proportionate and I think that taking into account what we did, it's still the highest, yes, but it is -- we could have done much higher -- we could have done, and that is perhaps interesting -- we could have gone as far as 1.5 billion, so to say. So the maximum amount is higher than what we did at the end of the day. So, reasonable, but sticking to our line, they should behave like they have to. [10:27] Q: Fine on top of another fine, is there any point in these figures? Are all these fines going to make any change to things for consumers? [10:41] Neelie Kroes: In the positive sense, because fines are not intended to be at the service of taxpayers. You know that the total quantity applies with these fines and penalty payments. Ultimately, they go into a fund whereby taxpayers pay less to Europe. No, this is a signal whereby we make it very clear that it is unacceptable if you don't abide by the rules, just as in traffic. If you don't stick to the rules in traffic, then you get a fine. It's precisely the same for companies, and by repeating, re-offending, we make it known and we take the duration into account as well. I'm convinced that ultimately, it is in the interest of the consumer that companies must respect our rules and list of conditions and conduct. Then there's better choice, better quality for everyone. Thank you. [12:11] Q: Madame Commissioner, could you remind us of the total amount of all the fines that have been issued against Microsoft and now if they've been paid?[also asked an unrelated question] [13:19] Neelie Kroes: Thank you for your question. The total amount that Microsoft owes us, has to pay us, is 1.676700 billion euros. So nearly 1.7 billion euros, so to say. So those are three fines together.[also response to unrelated question] [15:34] Q: Yeah, could I just ask, you said that you could have fined them up to 1.5 billion? Was that the 10% of relevant turnover we're talking about, or -- ? I mean, what proportion of turnover -- somebody's shaking their head, so clearly not. I mean, how is it calculated? In other words, what I'm trying to get at is, how is it calculated? And is it related to turnover or profits or what? And the other thing is, that given all these signals which they've been sending you in your pleasant conversations you've had with Steve Ballmer in Rotterdam, in restaurants near Rotterdam, does it not seem to the outside world to be rather vindictive, although it's as you've given -- you've taken no pleasure in imposing the fine? [16:21] Neelie Kroes: Well, that is my general answer to every fine I have to come to, that it's never pleasure. For me, the best day in office will be when there are zero fines, so to say. For that -- but if we are doing the job properly, and that having been said, we are doing the job properly and all those in the outside world are behaving. But I think that I need more than one term in office to get to that point, so to say. And I'm not believing that -- and even with two terms in office, I am nearly sure that that won't be the case. Having said that, of course it is always our intention, whatever company, whatever nationality, whatever member state is involved in that operation, to come to a point that it's clear-cut for the company to behave and to follow the rules and regulations, and that at the end of the day, deserve that consumers issue. What about the contacts with the CEO, and by the way, of course the contacts with the organization of Microsoft and DG Competition? It is all to try to get a solution in which that not behaving conformed to the rules and regulations and the judgment of the court, so to say, that that will be translated into a better behaving and in a better position for innovative actions from also the competitors and for more diversity in the sector. That having been said, if the maximum amount that I was mentioning of the periodic penalty payments could have theoretically been fixed at 1.5 billion [euros], the actual fixed amount is just shy. It's 60%. Nothing to do with whatever contact and so on, it has to do with the past, taking into account the period, so the number of days it has to do with the different phases in which they sometimes were moving a bit, and this is at the end of the day the final account we came to. And it's perhaps useful to point out that the last Article 24 decision in July 2006 for Microsoft's failure to provide complete and accurate specifications imposed a much larger share of the possible maximum. At that time, it was 75%. But, again, I think this is proportionate, it's reasonable, and it should be a signal to the outside world and especially a signal to Microsoft that we stick to our line. [19:16] Q: Commissioner, talking about the size of the fine, you said that the maximum possible fine would have been 1.5 billion euros. I'm just intrigued, given the size of Microsoft, given the length of time, given the fact that it's a repeat fine, why did you decide to go for less than the full amount? I mean, it's not as if Microsoft can't afford it. So why did you not go for the full amount? Why did you just go for the 60%? [19:49] Neelie Kroes: That, by the way, may never, ever be a line: Can someone afford, yes or no, is someone rich, yes or no. It is all in a fair but indeed, a way that you can defend the end of the amount also to the outside world. And rightly said by you, they are not a company that is in bad shape so to say. But that is exactly why we are interested in the company itself, because they have to perform like the other ones have to perform and taking into account that their own revenue, by the way, in the market is over 3 billion euros per year in this continent, then I think this is absolutely reasonable and you should take into account that the sky is not the limit for fines, it is just to be explained that we are reasonable and they have to be reasonable on their terms. [21:06] Q: You referred to Microsoft's announcement last week saying that the press communique was not sufficient, that there would have to be fundamental changes. Are you still skeptical about that announcement? And the announcement was made when you were discussing these fines today. Do you think that Microsoft went too far in their announcement? [21:38] Neelie Kroes: Well, I pretend to be not naive and I am not in the mood to accept when someone is mentioning that, talking about interoperability, the policy will be changed. First, show me. And then, I am willing and hopefully able to say that is in line with what we are asking for. By the way, that communication was not about tying, and as you are aware, we do have two big issues in our discussion with Microsoft. So talk is cheap -- and I was already mentioning that -- let's wait and let's find the reality in this case. And it's not the first moment that they were announcing this. We do have a couple of experiences. I even can remember four times that you should -- if you were naive -- should have thought over that everything was fixed but it didn't seem to be reality. So hopefully, this will be the fifth time and that will be the case but they have to deliver and to implement. [23:02][unrelated question and answer]

Neelie Kroes (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈneːli ˈkrus]; born 19 July 1941) is a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).[1]
Kroes, a corporate director by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 3 August 1971 after the Dutch general election of 1971. After the Dutch general election of 1977 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Van Agt-Wiegel with Kroes becoming Undersecretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 28 December 1977. After the Dutch general election of 1981 she returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 25 August 1981. After the Dutch general election of 1982 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Lubbers I with Kroes becoming Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 4 November 1982. Kroes remained Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the Cabinet Lubbers II following the Dutch general election of 1986. Kroes semi-retired from active politics and became Chancellor of the Nyenrode Business University serving from 1 June 1991 until 1 September 2000. In 2004 Kroes was selected as European Commissioner for Competition in the First Barroso Commission taking office on 22 November 2004. On 9 February 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda and a Vice President in the Second Barroso Commission serving until 1 November 2014.[2][3]
Kroes retired from active politics at the age of seventy-three. Following the end of her active political career, Kroes occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world and several international non-governmental organizations (Merrill Lynch, McDonald's, Lucent, Nedlloyd, Ballast Nedam, Salesforce.com, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and the Rembrandt House Museum).[4]
Kroes is known for her abilities as a team leader and negotiator. Kroes also has been active as an advocate in promoting startup companies.[5]

Career before politics[edit]
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.[6]
Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958 she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company "ZwaTra", the company of her father.
Local and national politics[edit]




Neelie Kroes and Wim Simons (nl) in 1975


Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971 she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981 she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.
Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.
After national politics[edit]
After her time as minister Kroes became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991 she became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001 Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.[7]
Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).
European Commission[edit]
Commissioner for Competition[edit]




Neelie Kroes as European Commissioner for Competition in 2007


In 2004 Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. Her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group in 2005 and 2006.[8]
Neelie Kroes made the Forbes' The World's 100 Most Powerful Women list multiple times: as number 53 in 2009,[9] 47 in 2008,[10] 59 in 2007,[11] 38 in 2006[12] and number 44 in 2005.[13] She is sometimes called "Nickel Neelie". She apparently earned her nickname because she's tough in the same vein as the UK "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher when dealing with competition issues.[14]
In 2009 she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.

Commissioner for Digital Agenda[edit]
In 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report[16] launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
She was in attendance at the Bilderberg conference in Sitges in Spain from 3 to 6 June 2010.[17]
Since 2010 she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.[18]
In 2010 it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011 Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg - who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011 due to plagiarism charges - as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.[19]
In November 2012 Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.[20]
After the European Commission[edit]
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies.[21] Since May 2015, she has been non-executive member of the Open Data Institute's board of directors.[22] From May 2016 onward, she will be a member of Salesforce's Board of Directors,[23] as well as Uber's Public Policy Advisory Board.[24]
Bahamas leak[edit]
In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers leak) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas.[25][26][27] As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company.[25][26] Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014).[25][27] According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an "oversight", and declared that she would take full responsibility.[25]
Miscellaneous information[edit]

Kroes, a liberal, was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper.
Kroes has been a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 1981 and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau since 1989.
Kroes was International Road Federation Man of the Year of 1993.
Kroes is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.
Kroes is a regular attendee of the annual Bilderberg Group meetings.
Kroes, as president of the Nyenrode Business University, has granted Bill Gates an honorary PhD.

Neelie Kroes (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈneːli ˈkrus]; born 19 July 1941) is a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).[1]
Kroes, a corporate director by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 3 August 1971 after the Dutch general election of 1971. After the Dutch general election of 1977 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Van Agt-Wiegel with Kroes becoming Undersecretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 28 December 1977. After the Dutch general election of 1981 she returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 25 August 1981. After the Dutch general election of 1982 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Lubbers I with Kroes becoming Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 4 November 1982. Kroes remained Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the Cabinet Lubbers II following the Dutch general election of 1986. Kroes semi-retired from active politics and became Chancellor of the Nyenrode Business University serving from 1 June 1991 until 1 September 2000. In 2004 Kroes was selected as European Commissioner for Competition in the First Barroso Commission taking office on 22 November 2004. On 9 February 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda and a Vice President in the Second Barroso Commission serving until 1 November 2014.[2][3]
Kroes retired from active politics at the age of seventy-three. Following the end of her active political career, Kroes occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world and several international non-governmental organizations (Merrill Lynch, McDonald's, Lucent, Nedlloyd, Ballast Nedam, Salesforce.com, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and the Rembrandt House Museum).[4]
Kroes is known for her abilities as a team leader and negotiator. Kroes also has been active as an advocate in promoting startup companies.[5]

Career before politics[edit]
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.[6]
Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958 she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company "ZwaTra", the company of her father.
Local and national politics[edit]




Neelie Kroes and Wim Simons (nl) in 1975


Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971 she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981 she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.
Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.
After national politics[edit]
After her time as minister Kroes became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991 she became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001 Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.[7]
Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).
European Commission[edit]
Commissioner for Competition[edit]




Neelie Kroes as European Commissioner for Competition in 2007


In 2004 Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. Her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group in 2005 and 2006.[8]
Neelie Kroes made the Forbes' The World's 100 Most Powerful Women list multiple times: as number 53 in 2009,[9] 47 in 2008,[10] 59 in 2007,[11] 38 in 2006[12] and number 44 in 2005.[13] She is sometimes called "Nickel Neelie". She apparently earned her nickname because she's tough in the same vein as the UK "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher when dealing with competition issues.[14]
In 2009 she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.

Commissioner for Digital Agenda[edit]
In 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report[16] launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
She was in attendance at the Bilderberg conference in Sitges in Spain from 3 to 6 June 2010.[17]
Since 2010 she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.[18]
In 2010 it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011 Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg - who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011 due to plagiarism charges - as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.[19]
In November 2012 Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.[20]
After the European Commission[edit]
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies.[21] Since May 2015, she has been non-executive member of the Open Data Institute's board of directors.[22] From May 2016 onward, she will be a member of Salesforce's Board of Directors,[23] as well as Uber's Public Policy Advisory Board.[24]
Bahamas leak[edit]
In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers leak) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas.[25][26][27] As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company.[25][26] Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014).[25][27] According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an "oversight", and declared that she would take full responsibility.[25]
Miscellaneous information[edit]

Kroes, a liberal, was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper.
Kroes has been a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 1981 and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau since 1989.
Kroes was International Road Federation Man of the Year of 1993.
Kroes is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.
Kroes is a regular attendee of the annual Bilderberg Group meetings.
Kroes, as president of the Nyenrode Business University, has granted Bill Gates an honorary PhD.

Neelie Kroes (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈneːli ˈkrus]; born 19 July 1941) is a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).[1]
Kroes, a corporate director by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 3 August 1971 after the Dutch general election of 1971. After the Dutch general election of 1977 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Van Agt-Wiegel with Kroes becoming Undersecretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 28 December 1977. After the Dutch general election of 1981 she returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 25 August 1981. After the Dutch general election of 1982 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Lubbers I with Kroes becoming Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 4 November 1982. Kroes remained Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the Cabinet Lubbers II following the Dutch general election of 1986. Kroes semi-retired from active politics and became Chancellor of the Nyenrode Business University serving from 1 June 1991 until 1 September 2000. In 2004 Kroes was selected as European Commissioner for Competition in the First Barroso Commission taking office on 22 November 2004. On 9 February 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda and a Vice President in the Second Barroso Commission serving until 1 November 2014.[2][3]
Kroes retired from active politics at the age of seventy-three. Following the end of her active political career, Kroes occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world and several international non-governmental organizations (Merrill Lynch, McDonald's, Lucent, Nedlloyd, Ballast Nedam, Salesforce.com, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and the Rembrandt House Museum).[4]
Kroes is known for her abilities as a team leader and negotiator. Kroes also has been active as an advocate in promoting startup companies.[5]

Career before politics[edit]
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.[6]
Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958 she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company "ZwaTra", the company of her father.
Local and national politics[edit]




Neelie Kroes and Wim Simons (nl) in 1975


Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971 she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981 she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.
Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.
After national politics[edit]
After her time as minister Kroes became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991 she became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001 Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.[7]
Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).
European Commission[edit]
Commissioner for Competition[edit]




Neelie Kroes as European Commissioner for Competition in 2007


In 2004 Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. Her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group in 2005 and 2006.[8]
Neelie Kroes made the Forbes' The World's 100 Most Powerful Women list multiple times: as number 53 in 2009,[9] 47 in 2008,[10] 59 in 2007,[11] 38 in 2006[12] and number 44 in 2005.[13] She is sometimes called "Nickel Neelie". She apparently earned her nickname because she's tough in the same vein as the UK "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher when dealing with competition issues.[14]
In 2009 she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.

Commissioner for Digital Agenda[edit]
In 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report[16] launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
She was in attendance at the Bilderberg conference in Sitges in Spain from 3 to 6 June 2010.[17]
Since 2010 she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.[18]
In 2010 it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011 Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg - who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011 due to plagiarism charges - as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.[19]
In November 2012 Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.[20]
After the European Commission[edit]
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies.[21] Since May 2015, she has been non-executive member of the Open Data Institute's board of directors.[22] From May 2016 onward, she will be a member of Salesforce's Board of Directors,[23] as well as Uber's Public Policy Advisory Board.[24]
Bahamas leak[edit]
In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers leak) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas.[25][26][27] As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company.[25][26] Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014).[25][27] According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an "oversight", and declared that she would take full responsibility.[25]
Miscellaneous information[edit]

Kroes, a liberal, was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper.
Kroes has been a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 1981 and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau since 1989.
Kroes was International Road Federation Man of the Year of 1993.
Kroes is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.
Kroes is a regular attendee of the annual Bilderberg Group meetings.
Kroes, as president of the Nyenrode Business University, has granted Bill Gates an honorary PhD.

Neelie Kroes (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈneːli ˈkrus]; born 19 July 1941) is a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).[1]
Kroes, a corporate director by occupation, was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 3 August 1971 after the Dutch general election of 1971. After the Dutch general election of 1977 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Van Agt-Wiegel with Kroes becoming Undersecretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 28 December 1977. After the Dutch general election of 1981 she returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 25 August 1981. After the Dutch general election of 1982 a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy resulted in the formation of the Cabinet Lubbers I with Kroes becoming Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management taking office on 4 November 1982. Kroes remained Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the Cabinet Lubbers II following the Dutch general election of 1986. Kroes semi-retired from active politics and became Chancellor of the Nyenrode Business University serving from 1 June 1991 until 1 September 2000. In 2004 Kroes was selected as European Commissioner for Competition in the First Barroso Commission taking office on 22 November 2004. On 9 February 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda and a Vice President in the Second Barroso Commission serving until 1 November 2014.[2][3]
Kroes retired from active politics at the age of seventy-three. Following the end of her active political career, Kroes occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world and several international non-governmental organizations (Merrill Lynch, McDonald's, Lucent, Nedlloyd, Ballast Nedam, Salesforce.com, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and the Rembrandt House Museum).[4]
Kroes is known for her abilities as a team leader and negotiator. Kroes also has been active as an advocate in promoting startup companies.[5]

Career before politics[edit]
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.[6]
Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958 she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women's organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company "ZwaTra", the company of her father.
Local and national politics[edit]




Neelie Kroes and Wim Simons (nl) in 1975


Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.
In 1971 she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981 she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.
Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.
During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.
After national politics[edit]
After her time as minister Kroes became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald's Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).
In 1991 she became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.
According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001 Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.[7]
Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of Poets of all Nations, the Delta Psychiatric Hospital and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).
European Commission[edit]
Commissioner for Competition[edit]




Neelie Kroes as European Commissioner for Competition in 2007


In 2004 Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. Her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.
As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.
Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group in 2005 and 2006.[8]
Neelie Kroes made the Forbes' The World's 100 Most Powerful Women list multiple times: as number 53 in 2009,[9] 47 in 2008,[10] 59 in 2007,[11] 38 in 2006[12] and number 44 in 2005.[13] She is sometimes called "Nickel Neelie". She apparently earned her nickname because she's tough in the same vein as the UK "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher when dealing with competition issues.[14]
In 2009 she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.

Commissioner for Digital Agenda[edit]
In 2010 she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010. The Digital Agenda for Europe[15] is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report[16] launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.
She was in attendance at the Bilderberg conference in Sitges in Spain from 3 to 6 June 2010.[17]
Since 2010 she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.[18]
In 2010 it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.
In December 2011 Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg - who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011 due to plagiarism charges - as advisor to the European Commission as part of its No Disconnect Strategy designed to promote Internet freedom.[19]
In November 2012 Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.[20]
After the European Commission[edit]
Kroes is currently leading StartupDelta, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies.[21] Since May 2015, she has been non-executive member of the Open Data Institute's board of directors.[22] From May 2016 onward, she will be a member of Salesforce's Board of Directors,[23] as well as Uber's Public Policy Advisory Board.[24]

In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers leak) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas.[25][26][27] As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company.[25][26] Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014).[25][27] According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an "oversight", and declared that she would take full responsibility.[25]
Miscellaneous information[edit]

Kroes, a liberal, was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper.
Kroes has been a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 1981 and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau since 1989.
Kroes was International Road Federation Man of the Year of 1993.
Kroes is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.
Kroes is a regular attendee of the annual Bilderberg Group meetings.
Kroes, as president of the Nyenrode Business University, has granted Bill Gates an honorary PhD.

Ex-European Commissioner Neelie Kroes joins the board of Salesforce

BBC micro:bit learn-to-code device finally rolling out to UK schools












One of the most powerful regulators in European tech in the last decade has found a landing place outside of the halls of Brussels. Today, CRM giant Salesforce announced that Neelie Kroes — a former vice president of the European Commission, European Commissioner for Competition, and European Commissioner for Digital Agenda — is joining its board of directors. She is the second high-profile ex-government figure to join the board in as many years, following the appointment of General Colin Powell almost exactly two years ago — a sign of how the company continues to eye up the public sector for lucrative service contracts.
“We are delighted to have Neelie Kroes join our Board of Directors,” said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, Salesforce, in a statement. “She is an amazing and respected leader who has done extraordinary work at the highest levels of government, technology policy and business inEurope. Salesforce will benefit greatly from her broad experience across both the public and private sectors.”
“Salesforce is one of the world’s most admired companies and a leader in digital transformation for business,” said Neelie Kroes. “It’s an honor for me to serve on the Salesforce Board of Directors.”
The appointment becomes effective on May 1, and brings the total number of people on Salesforce’s board to 12 (General Powell was number 11). She will join a number of other high-profile people on the board, including Maynard Webb, chairman of Yahoo! Inc.; and Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. Kroes will become the third woman on Salesforce’s board.
Adding Kroes to Salesforce’s board is interesting for a few reasons.
First, the company is gaining a sharp mind and strong operative in the area of regulation, which could help shape how a company like Salesforce can exist within that framework. Kroes’ final role in the European Commission was as its vice president, and her previous roles as Commissioners Competition and Digital Agenda, means that she was often sparring with large tech companies over antitrust issues; but at the same time she was also enlisting them in the bigger efforts that she was leading to bring down the digital divide across Europe, and foster more tech development as a route to economic growth.
Salesforce has mostly remained outside investigations at the EC level when it comes to antitrust issues (see: Google and Microsoft), or issues of privacy (see: Google and Facebook), but as one of the larger tech companies in the world, it may not always escape that scrutiny.
Before her roles at the EC level, Kroes was a longtime politician in her native Netherlands.
Second, Salesforce has been ramping up its presence in Europe over the last several years both in terms of direct business and also expanding its ecosystem, and so Kroes’ appointment also underscores Salesforce’s focus on this market.
Among its activities: the company last September announced a $100 million fund to invest in European cloud startups, and separately to that, Salesforce Ventures has been making direct investments in a number of more mature tech startups like NewVoiceMedia and Qubit.
Third, this is also one more sign of how Salesforce continues to eye up more lucrative contracts in the public sector. This is something that we pointed out was already a large business area for the company in 2014 when General Powell joined the board. Having someone like Kroes at the company also helps to extend Salesforce’s credibility in this area.
As more businesses — and specifically government and public sector organizations — update their IT assets and move their operations into the cloud, Salesforce is not the only big U.S. tech company eyeing up how to expand its CRM business with them.
Last week, IBM acquired a UK company called Optevia that focuses on CRM integrations for groups in this vertical. Optevia’s track record to date has been mainly focused on Microsoft software and UK organizations — but IBM told me it plans to expand Optevia’s reach to cover other vendors and other geographies.
Kroes in the past has been on the boards of AB Volvo, Ballast Nedam, McDonald’s Netherlands, Lucent Netherlands, P&O Nedlloyd and Nederlandse Spoorwegen and was chairperson of Nyenrode University. Kroes is also a member of the financial committee of the Rijksmuseum, Salesforce says, and she also serves as Special Envoy for StartupDelta, a public/private partnership to establish a thriving ecosystem of startup companies in the Netherlands.
The full board at Salesforce, in addition to Kroes after May 1, includes Marc Benioff, Salesforce chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Salesforce vice chairman, president and COO; Craig Conway, former CEO of PeopleSoft; Alan Hassenfeld, former chairman and CEO of Hasbro; General Colin Powell, retired four star general in the U.S. Army and former U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Sanford Robertson, principal of Francisco Partners; John Roos, former U.S. Ambassador to Japan; Lawrence Tomlinson, former senior vice president and treasurer of Hewlett-Packard; Robin Washington, CFO of Gilead Sciences; Maynard Webb, chairman of Yahoo! Inc.; Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube.

Creating New Investors with StartupDelta

January 11, 2015January 12, 2015Bo-Peter 


StartupDelta
Starting January 14th Startup Delta will take its first tour around the Netherlands, to host a series of 6 mini-hackathons to co-create the online startup community ecosystems, centered around StartupDelta.org. The meetup session for the Amsterdam community is already fully booked, evidence of the excitement within the startup community around StartupDelta, lead by Neelie Kroes. The program for each of the six meetups focus on gathering and providing information around four points:

Position the Netherlands as the country for startups within Europe.
Attract (fast growing) tech startups, talent, investors and corporate innovation teams from foreign countries.
Inform Dutch as well as foreign startups about all aspects relevant for Business Support.
Create a community for all players within our Dutch startup ecosystem.

While the initiative seeks out to position the Netherlands as the startup hub for Europe, there is a key point that these meetups are not addressing: the lack of available capital in the Netherlands. One doesn’t need to look far for evidence of Dutch startups falling apart due to lack of funding, ie. online catering business VanChefs. News site StartupJuncture detailed all the funding raised by Dutch startups in 2014, totaling up to €500 Million across 75 companies. As StartupJuncture notes, this is something to be proud of among us Dutch, but to achieve the ambitions of StartupDelta to attract foreign startups and investors to the Netherlands, much more is necessary.
The Reinvestment Cycle. Source: Startup Capital Ventures
 
There is abundant wealth in the Netherlands; in order to create the reinvestment cycle that is character of Silicon Valley for successful startups, StartupDelta should focus on creating new sources of investment from experienced business people who can become Angel Investors and from big brand names that are able to make big investments. Venture Capital firms will also need to mature, but do more to raise capital for their funds. To understand more of why these funding structures are necessary to create leading startup scene in Europe, looking at the lifecycle of startups will provide more insight.
The Startup Life Cycle
The Startup Life Cycle. Source: NetValley
My favorite definition of a Startup runs along these lines: “A startup is a company which has yet to find a scalable business model.” While some say a startup is a state of mind, the purpose of my definition is to take into account the monetary aspect of startup companies. Most startups seek this scalable model as they develop or have developed a product or service ready for the market. However, where most startups encounter problems is a region in the life cycle known as the “Valley of Death”. Typically speaking, companies need capital during this time in order to survive until it turns a profit and create and refine its scalable model. More than capital, founders need mentoring; cue the Angel Investors. Getting to the break-even point is no easy affair, and even then achieving a scalable model for sustainable growth is hard work. However, once the startup creates a scalable model, the company needs to grow too. Seed Rounds and Venture Capital will support the company team to expand in order scale out the product or service and eventually the maturity in which the company no longer really refers to itself as a startup. StartupDelta exists as a concentrated effort by the Ministry of Economics to support startups because the ministry recognizes the potential for small young companies to make a big impact. If the goal of creating a startup ecosystem is to be realized, capital must be available.
StartupDelta must create the Reinvestment Cycle to achieve its goals
StartupDelta will surely boost the Netherlands startup community, and the goals they’ve set as outlined above will help accomplish that. Nonetheless, an emphasis on making capital available to startups need to be present. The StartupDelta tour across the Netherlands will set the stage for Neelie Kroes and it is without a doubt of great importance. As these meetups take place to co-create the community portals, those present must focus on how to stimulate the Netherlands’ normally conservative fiscal sentiment into investing in risky startups. My suggestion is to build a place for startups and investors to seriously meet and find each other, but beyond that convince experienced business people with enough personal liquid assets to become Angel Investors. Furthermore, existing and future Venture Capital Firms in the Netherlands will need help raising money for their funds, StartupDelta can help here too. Ambitious entrepreneurs with talent and innovation are building startups and get great support from accelerators and knowledge centers (who are the main partners of StartupDelta too!). The next step in creating the reinvestment cycle for the startup ecosystem is to help these startups find their scalable model and reap profits. What comes next is hallmark of Silicon Valley, companies grow big, go public and profits are made for the startup, its Angels and the VCs; they go back to invest in new startups. When this happens, StartupDelta will succeed in making the Netherlands the startup ecosystem of Europe we want it to be.
