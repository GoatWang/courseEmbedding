His practice focus includes concerns with panic attacks and phobias, social anxiety issues, life crisis and grieving, and general stress issues.
Choosing a psychologist is one of the most personal decisions a person suffering mental health issues can make. Patients want to select someone who is not only experienced, but caring and approachable as well.

In general, Dr. Lamb’s practice involves the use of psychotherapeutic treatment, following a psychological assessment of the patient, to delve into the complaints and needs. He works in a private setting and does not prescribe the use of psychotropic medications, but rather promotes the acquisition of the skills necessary to handle life’s difficulties.The key is to work with the patient to help change harmful or dysfunctional ways of thinking and behavior that may be interfering with their enjoyment of life. Patients are treated with the utmost respect and compassion as they gradually gain control over their feelings.The office, at 12 North 4th St. in L’Anse, MI, 49946, is completely private and confidentiality is guaranteed.

Square-jawed and built like a muscled thoroughbred stallion, Augustus Nobel Driggs intimidates everyone inside the penitentiary just across the border from Mexico, including the young warden.
Suddenly, Driggs and a pack of cold-blooded convicts are on the loose—and it’s up to itinerant lawmen Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch to capture them and rescue the woman they kidnapped. But the ever-elusive Driggs is on his own furious hunt for a hidden cache of gold and jewels—and for the men who left him for dead.
With an unconventional Yankee detective by their side, Cole and Hitch set off on a massive manhunt. When Driggs discovers one of the lawmen is a fellow West Point graduate he’d just as soon see dead, he seeks vengeance at any cost.
