ST. LOUIS, May 26, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Following its annual shareholders' meeting today at 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time, Diane M. Sullivan has assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Brown Shoe Company, Inc. (NYSE:   BWS, www.brownshoe.com.)
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110526/CG09809)
The company announced in January its promotion of Sullivan, who previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer. She steps into the role today following a four-month transition period from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ronald A. Fromm. Fromm remains Brown Shoe's Chairman of the Board.
"In my first few months I am prioritizing the identification of opportunities to strengthen the alignment of our businesses with our key consumer focus areas of healthy living, contemporary fashion and family – and in doing so increase our connection with customers and drive shareholder value. Together with my leadership team and the tremendous Brown Shoe talent around the globe, I'm committed to building on our great foundation to further the momentum of the past year as we inspire people to feel good and live better, feet first," said Sullivan.
Sullivan joined Brown Shoe in 2004 as President, adding the role of Chief Operating Officer in 2006, and was first elected to Brown Shoe's Board of Directors in 2007.

She drove investments in Brown Shoe's global sourcing network, product development and design talent, resulting in design and technology innovations that create an even better footwear experience for consumers.
Before joining Brown Shoe, Sullivan served as Vice Chairman of the Footwear Group for Phillips-Van Heusen from 2001 to 2004. She established herself in the footwear industry at a pair of leading companies, serving as President and Chief Operating Officer for Stride Rite Corporation, where she worked from 1995 until 2001, and, prior to that, as Vice President, Product and Marketing for The Rockport Company.

However, little is known about how the source of knowledge acquisition during venture creation affects desirable venture outcomes.  We draw on learning and social network theories as well as the knowledge-based view and examine the learning of technology entrepreneurs operating in university-affiliated incubators.  We explore questions regarding how 1) the extent of founders’ knowledge acquisition, 2) founders’ reliance on network learning, and 3) the interactive effect of the two, impact both the innovativeness of the initial product or service and first-year sales.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/3/Entrepreneurial networksA Multi-level process view of new venture emergencehttps://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/4/"Multi-Level Issues in Creativity and Innovation" is Volume 7 of "Research in Multi-Level Issues", an annual series that provides an outlet for the discussion of multi-level problems and solutions across a variety of fields of study. Using a scientific debate format of a key scholarly essay followed by two commentaries and a rebuttal, we present, in this series, theoretical work, significant empirical studies, methodological developments, analytical techniques, and philosophical treatments to advance the field of multi-level studies, regardless of disciplinary perspective.Similar to Volumes 1 through 6 (Yammarino & Dansereau, 2002, 2004, 2006; Dansereau & Yammarino, 2003, 2005, 2007), this volume, Volume 7, edited by Mumford, Hunter, and Bedell-Avers, contains five major essays with commentaries and rebuttals that cover a range of topics, but in the realms of creativity and innovation. In particular, the five critical essays offer extensive literature reviews, new model developments, methodological advancements, and some data for the study of creativity and social influence, innovation and planning, creativity and cognitive processes, sub-system configuration, and new venture emergence. While each of the major essays, and associated commentaries and rebuttals, is unique in orientation, they show a common bond in raising and addressing multi-level issues or discussing problems and solutions that involve multiple levels of analysis in creativity and innovation.It provides in-depth scholarly information on multiple level issues in organizations and time. It is international in scope.https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/4/No Subject AreaHOW ENTREPRENEURS’ KNOWLEDGE AND RELIANCE ON NETWORK TIES RELATE TO STARTUP PERFORMANCE (SUMMARY)https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/8/<p>Scholars agree that entrepreneurs’ networks and knowledge are important during early venture formation and recent network research has begun investigating how the interplay between entrepreneurs’ knowledge sets and overall network structure (e.g., overall network size) relate to venture performance. Little research has examined how entrepreneurs’ knowledge and <em>subsets</em> (e.g., family, friends, coworkers, etc.) of network ties relate to performance outcomes. One subset of ties recently studied is family versus non-family ties, although thorough investigation has been neglected. This is problematic because some research suggests benefits accrued from family ties may vary from non-family ties. This paper examines and finds that entrepreneurs’ knowledge and subsets of network ties (non-family ties) systematically relate to the number of employees in young ventures.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/8/Entrepreneurial networksREGULATORY FOCUS, OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION AND CREATIVITY:  AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION (INTERACTIVE PAPER)https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/7/<p>Shane and Venkataraman (2000) state that entrepreneurship “<em>…involves…the processes of</em> discovery, evaluation, <em>and exploitation of opportunities...</em>” Despite its importance and the research attention it has received to date, the process of opportunity recognition (OpRec) is not as well understood as it might be.  Our study adds to the literature by combining regulatory focus (RF) with elements from prior research on creativity to expand the conceptual understanding of OpRec. Some scholars have described OpRec as a creative process, others have tested the effects of RF on creativity but to date no one has combined the two in a single experimental design. Specifically, we examine the effect of RF on the generation and evaluation/selection of business ideas as well as the novelty and usefulness of ideas selected.</p>
https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/7/Entrepreneurial cognitionGENDER DIFFERENCES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP: ASSESSING PERCEPTIONS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL OUTCOMES AMONG MEN AND WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS (SUMMARY)https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/2/<p>A wide variety of research has examined performance differences between women and men entrepreneurs. While many studies find significant differences between men and women in regards to economic outcomes, explanations for these differences vary widely. This is problematic, as we believe that the real reason for differences stems from the entrepreneurial outcomes emphasized by women versus men entrepreneurs. Women utilize and emphasize relationships with others differently during the entrepreneurial process in an effort to realize desired outcomes. As a result, the assumption that men and women want the same outcomes (i.e. economic outcomes) from venturing may be misguided. This paper examines and finds that male and female entrepreneurs differ in regards to several relationship oriented, non-economic entrepreneurial outcomes, while showing no differences in regards to traditional economic outcomes.</p>

These skills, along with the potential risks and rewards and environmental settings and characteristics, are explored.https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/9/No Subject AreaEXTENDING RESEARCH IN OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION: ASSESSING DIVERGENT THINKING, EVALUATION AND ELABORATION ABILITIES (INTERACTIVE PAPER)https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/6/<p>Creativity has been linked with opportunity recognition (Kirzner, 1999; Ward, 2004; Baron, 2008). The number and innovativeness of opportunities represent two dimensions of divergent thinking – fluency and originality, respectively. However, two other dimensions of divergent thinking (Guilford, 1967) – flexibility (diversity of opportunities) and elaboration (detail of the opportunities) – have not been assessed in the existing literature on opportunities.</p>
<p>Several prior studies have presumed that the more opportunities (fluency) the better one’s opportunity recognition ability (e.g., Corbett, 2007; Hills & Shrader, 1998; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005). However, entrepreneurs need to recognize the value of their ideas and work to elaborate their ideas into opportunities (Dimov, 2007), both of which are represented in most models of opportunity recognition (e.g., Ardichvili, et al., 2003). Little research to date has been conducted to examine how entrepreneurs evaluate, select or develop opportunities.</p>

Research suggests entrepreneurs’ networks are associated with obtaining new information, identifying opportunities (Burt, 2004; Granovetter, 1973), and acquiring resources (Wu, Wang, Chen & Pan, 2008).  Interestingly, while research has investigated antecedents to and consequences of engaging in network relationships, most research has focused on consequences (Hoang & Antoncic, 2003).  Resultantly, a gap has emerged in our understanding of how entrepreneurs’ networks develop and change over time.  This is problematic because some scholars contend that changing resource needs during venture development necessitate a concomitant change in entrepreneurs’ networks to allow access to newly-needed resources (Greve & Salaff, 2003; Hite & Hesterly, 2001).  If entrepreneurs’ networks need to evolve over time as resource requirements change, more research is needed studying their dynamics.  To address this, we explore two questions – How does the size of an early-stage entrepreneur’s network affect the subsequent structural (e.g., size) and content (e.g., knowledge heterogeneity) character of their network?  How does the strength of an early-stage entrepreneur’s network ties affect the subsequent structural (e.g., size and tie strength) and content (e.g., knowledge heterogeneity) character of their network?</p>
Diane M. Sullivan et al.https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/5/Entrepreneurial networksTHE INFLUENCE OF GENDER AND SELF-IDENTITY ON ATTITUDES TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY - EVIDENCE FROM EXISTING ENTREPRENEURS (SUMMARY)https://works.bepress.com/diane_sullivan/11/<p>Sustainable development is gaining recognition as a sub-domain of entrepreneurship and recent research has suggested that sustainable entrepreneurship may be the most important topic of our time. The majority of the existing research focuses on theory building and qualitative case studies of new ventures. While commendable, this research leaves a gap in our understanding about the attitudes existing entrepreneurs possess regarding sustainability. This study develops a measure of environmental sustainability orientation (ESO) to examine the impact of gender, and self-identity (SI) on the sustainability orientation of existing entrepreneurs. We explore questions regarding 1) gender differences in ESO, 2) the relationship between SI and ESO, 3) how gender moderates the SI-ESO relationship, and 4) if age of the venture relates to ESO.</p>
