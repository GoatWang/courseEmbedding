Indigo Sleep’s Breakthrough Modular Mattress Delivers Comfort You Can Customize


Posted on July 27, 2017July 27, 2017 by Chris Rosica 



 

27
Jul



Patented Design Unlocks Value Inside the Mattress, Saving Money and Easing Stress on the Planet
Newly-launched Indigo Sleep is upending the mattress industry with a breakthrough mattress that literally opens up a new way of sleeping. At the heart of its Comfort Always® mattress is a modular design that lets you pop off the mattress cover and rotate or flip it to meet your comfort preferences, whether firm or soft, giving you two mattress “feels” for the price of one. It even offers a cooling temperature option for one or both sleepers. The renewable aspect refers to the patented design, which was grounded in intensive research. When a section of the mattress becomes worn, you can simply replace that part at a fraction of the price of a new mattress. This can extend the life of the original mattress indefinitely and significantly reduce the number of used mattresses that are being thrown away and damaging the environment.
To provide added value to consumers, Indigo bypassed the costly bricks and mortar business model and is selling its mattresses via e-commerce at indigosleep.com.
The company was founded by tech and startup veterans David Funk and Gene DeRose who are determined to shake up an industry in urgent need of a wake up call. They saw traditional mattresses as being overpriced, potentially hazardous to your health because many contain toxic chemicals, and harmful to the environment. In forming Indigo Sleep, they are making that model obsolete and giving people a new way to sleep. In testing the Indigo products, they also heard consumers say loud and clear that they couldn’t believe the mattress could be cleaned from the inside out. This was a huge benefit for them and something they couldn’t find in any other mattress.
“Our mattresses are designed to be updated rather than replaced. Traditional mattresses are not made to last and get prematurely tossed into landfills, forcing consumers to spend money on a replacement mattress too soon,” said co-founder David Funk. “We’ve created a new breed of mattress that can practically last forever, simply by replacing parts that need refreshing. We like to think Indigo is the last mattress you’ll ever have to buy.”
Safety is paramount to the company and they rely upon the latest consumer safety laws and science to place only the cleanest, high-quality, ethically sourced materials into their mattresses, as opposed to potentially harmful, “dirty chemistry” and fiberglass used by many other mattress companies.
Another proprietary advantage of the Indigo design is that the mattress can be opened up to vacuum and deep clean it from the inside out. Mattresses accumulate pounds of dirt and grime over their lifetime, yet until now, there hasn’t been a way to remove the dirt from inside.
“Most people take their mattress for granted and are unaware of the health and environmental dangers they may contain or cause,” said co-founder Gene DeRose. “Indigo is putting an end to that. In addition to providing premium quality at a fair price, we want to bring a new focus on the consumer’s right to be better informed about a product’s attention to health, safety, and environmental sustainability. We’re doing all that and more with our products, but also by collaborating with our customers, initially through the charitable donations each mattress purchase triggers.”
Indigo offers two mattress models, the Comfort Always® CLASSIC and the Comfort Always® LUXURY, which are sold direct to consumers at indigosleep.com. Both are available in Youth/Twin, Full, Queen or King size. Mattresses by Indigo begin at $599.00.
When someone buys an Indigo mattress, the company will donate $50 in the buyer’s name to whatever cause they prefer from among the list of nonprofits carefully selected by Indigo because of their alignment with company values. Among organizations featured are the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Southern Poverty Law Center, Planned Parenthood and The Smithsonian Institution.
About Indigo Sleep 
Indigo Sleep, based in Tampa, Florida, is a sleep products company whose goal is to disrupt the mattress industry by making better, longer lasting products that use only the cleanest, safest ingredients that are environmentally-friendly. Indigo seeks to make people healthier and happier through better sleep and is grounded in values that protect people and the environment. The company’s mattresses are renewable, upgradable, long lasting and sustainable. For more information or to purchase a mattress, visit indigosleep.com.


     







Innovative PBM Introduces Pharmacogenetics Offering


Posted on July 26, 2017July 26, 2017 by Chris Rosica 


Benecard PBF Launches BenePrecise to Eliminate Trial and Error in Finding Medications That Work
BeneCard PBF, a leader in providing clinical solutions that address the crisis of rising drug costs, has taken a step toward more efficient, personalized clinical care for members through its BenePrecise Pharmacogenetics program. Pharmacogenetics allows prescribers and pharmacists to understand how medications react differently in the body based on an individual’s metabolism. BenePrecise applies the results of a fast and easy-to-administer pharmacogenetics test to enhance member safety, improve treatment outcomes and prevent wasteful drug spending.
BenePrecise utilizes precision medicine, which evaluates and considers a patient’s metabolism, environment and lifestyle, to develop effective, individualized treatment plans. Through BenePrecise, BeneCard PBF’s pharmacists work with members and their prescribers to coordinate changes in drug therapies, as indicated by pharmacogenetic testing. This ensures that members receive the most clinically appropriate and effective medications. By proactively identifying which drug therapies will not work, or are likely to cause severe adverse reactions, clients and their members can avoid unnecessary risks and expenses.
“We are excited to offer our BenePrecise program,” says Jennifer Fuhrmann, PharmD and Vice President of Clinical Services for BeneCard PBF. “Pharmacogenetic testing can have a measurable positive impact for members who live with chronic health challenges such as diabetes or high cholesterol. Our pharmacists can help them move quickly onto the most appropriate drug therapy and improve their health with fewer side effects and less risk, based on their unique metabolism.”
There are no doctor’s visits required to administer the test. Members can collect and submit the sample from home using a simple cheek swab. The markers identified by pharmacogenetic testing do not change over a member’s lifetime, so repeat tests are not required.
BenePrecise enables a personalized approach to care aimed at reducing costs, improving treatment efficacy and preventing adverse drug reactions.
About BeneCard PBF
Through pharmacogenetics and proactive clinical programs, BeneCard PBF enhances patient outcomes while lowering prescription drug costs. With offices in Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, BeneCard PBF administers fixed-rate and self-funded prescription benefit programs. The company offers innovative solutions to control costs while providing the highest quality service available in prescription benefit management.

Dynarex, a leading medical supply company and provider of disposable medical products, has launched an extensive line of products, specifically for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals and units.

“Dynarex is committed to serving many market segments within the medical field and beyond.  We are especially committed to EMS professionals and departments, as they are often the first on the scene and they have the most need for our medical products,” said Zalman Tenenbaum, President and CEO of Dynarex.  “Dynarex’s motto is, “We Care Like Family” and we truly consider the EMS community a part of our family because of the important and essential work that they do.”
The products within Dynarex’s new line include:

Burgess® Launches Burgess Source™


Posted on June 8, 2017June 8, 2017 by Chris Rosica 


New Cloud SaaS Solution Designed to Prevent Billions in Waste, Transform Healthcare Administration
Burgess, a leading cloud-based solution provider serving healthcare payers, introduces Burgess Source, a first of its kind platform that natively brings together payment integrity, pricing, contract terms configuration, audit and real-time business intelligence. By combining these fragmented elements into one system, Burgess Source is the most effective way to prospectively avoid inappropriate and inaccurate reimbursement, maintain a point to point compliance trail and model healthcare payments.
According to the Harvard Business Review, the U.S. healthcare system would save $130B if insurance administrative complexity were reduced to the same levels as other service industries. Moreover, the American Medical Association (AMA) reports that it would save the system $14B if every claim was paid correctly the first time.
Incorporating technology to solve many of these industry inefficiencies, the Burgess Source platform is built from the ground up to eliminate non-communicative disparate point solutions and promote a new standard in transparency and payment accountability. The unique design also models claims data, providing real time business intelligence, helping ACOs and health plans make smarter decisions. Highly configurable, it allows users complete control to adapt the platform to each plans’ specific requirements while the Burgess Source team keeps the data and regulatory policy management up to date and compliant.
Currently 17.8% of every premium goes to operating costs, according to AHIP’s Center for Policy and Research. By shifting money from inefficient and inaccurate payment transactions to delivering high quality defensible business outcomes, Burgess Source is designed to promote lower costs and innovate operations across the industry.
“Non-communicative payment platforms lead to waste, repeat work and frustration among payers, providers and members. Through advanced and previously unavailable technology, analytics and a sophisticated data delivery model, we’ve reinvented the current complex claims payment integrity and pricing process to dramatically improve first pass payment accuracy and compliance, which impacts all stakeholders in healthcare,” says Greg Burgess, Founder and Chief Product Officer at Burgess. “Burgess Source will provide a new standard in payment accountability, which was previously non-existent,” he adds.
Burgess Source is reinventing reimbursement and accountability between payers and providers to:

Prospectively limit errors and markedly improve payment accuracy through cost avoidance.
Improve operational efficiencies and financial performance.
Maintain for instant recall a claim’s full audit trail including regulatory citations, the specific contract terms in effect when processed, all payment integrity edit definitions, and pricing terms employed at the exact moment the claim is processed.
Promote transparency and accountability with providers while supporting both internal and external audits.
Monitor the impact of policy changes before making them with real time analytics.
Offer “what if” scenarios using historical claims data to model various services using comparative analytics.
Limit rework by parallel processing all payment integrity edits in a single pass to tell a provider everything that’s right or wrong with a claim.

 About Burgess 
Burgess operates at the intersection of healthcare, finance and technology.  The company helps leading American health insurers and ACOs set a new standard: Payment Accountability. The company’s cloud-based platform, Burgess Source, is the only solution that natively brings together up-to-date regulatory data, claims pricing and editing, and real-time analytics tools. This unified approach allows clients to make payments with total confidence, and make business decisions with real intelligence. The company is headquartered in Alexandria, VA and online at burgessgroup.com.

Dynarex Announces 2017 First Responder Caring Award


Posted on May 24, 2017 by Chris Rosica 


Award kicks off during National EMS Week (May 21-27)
Dynarex, a leading medical products brand and provider of disposable medical products, announces the 2017 Dynarex “First Responder Caring Award.”  To acknowledge its appreciation for and commitment to first responders, Dynarex would like to recognize a first responder or department who in 2017, has demonstrated the essence of caring or compassion, which can include personnel in EMT, EMS, paramedic, police or fire.  As a result, the company wants to hear from the first responder community with unique and newsworthy stories of heroism, exceptional community service, acts of compassion or demonstration of caring and commitment to others.  Dynarex is also recognizing National EMS Week (May 21-27) with the launch of the award program.
“Everything we do at Dynarex and beyond exemplifies our motto, ‘We Care Like Family.’  The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and first responder community is important to us, so we wanted to create a program where we can recognize the amazing work that they do every day,” said Zalman Tenenbaum, President and CEO of Dynarex.  “We look forward to receiving these compelling stories and are honored to have the opportunity to award a group of important individuals.”
A panel of independent judges from the first responder community such as National EMS Management Association, as well as representatives from Dynarex, including Tenenbaum and Clinical Advocate Janette Ostrander, will select four regional winners (West Coast, South, East Coast and Central States/Midwest) and one national grand prize winner.
Dynarex will award $5,000 in medical supplies to the national winner and $1,000 in medical supplies to each of the four regional semi-finalists, which can be donated by the winner to their unit or to a worthy 501c3 nonprofit of their choice.
The submission should include background/history on the first responder and/or their EMS department and information on why the individual or unit/department should receive Dynarex’s “First Responder Caring Award.”  Inclusion of photos, video or news clips is encouraged.
Essay criteria and submission information can be found at www.dynarex.com/firstresponderpromo.php.  The deadline for entries is September 15, 2017.  Winners will be announced on October 18th, 2017 at the EMS World Expo Show at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Exergen Moves The Needle In Temperature Taking And Electronic Medical Records


Posted on April 27, 2017 by Chris Rosica 


Exergen Corporation announces the availability of new professional Temporal Artery Thermometer TAT-5000S models connected to leading vital signs monitors. The new TemporalScanner models are available in six different variations to meet a variety of major vital signs monitor requirements, all supporting the use and advancement of Electronic Medical Records (EMR).
The connection of the TemporalScanner, an award-winning, breakthrough medical thermometer supported by more than 70 peer-reviewed published studies for accurate, completely non-invasive temperature assessment, now eliminates the need for manual entry of data, when connected to vital signs monitors. This significantly aids in the organization, security and confidentiality of patient records. In addition, the connected Exergen TAT models provide convenience and speed for the clinician.
“Through the addition of these new models, we are able to meet the demands of hospitals and clinics for fast, accurate, non-invasive thermometers connected to vital signs monitors, which all automatically record patient data, saving time, improving record accuracy and security, and reducing costs,” said Francesco Pompei, Ph.D., CEO of Exergen Corporation. “Our focus on patient comfort and security speaks to our commitment of introducing new connected models of TATs for vital signs monitors,” added Dr. Pompei.
Exergen Corporation is dedicated to improving and increasing quality, efficiency and accuracy of temperature taking in patient records. With more than 70 published studies supporting its accuracy, the TemporalScanner helps improve patient outcomes while improving patient and clinician experience. The connected models are now available with eight leading vital signs monitors (see http://www.exergen.com//tat5000s).
ABOUT EXERGEN CORPORATION
Exergen manufactures and markets two series of the TemporalScanner thermometer: a professional version for hospitals and clinics, and a consumer version sold in major retailers nationwide. More than two billion temperatures are taken each year with TemporalScanners.  Used in thousands of hospitals and clinics across the country as well as in millions of homes, TemporalScanners are the #1 preference of pediatricians, #1 preference of nurses, and #1 selling retail thermometer. The Exergen TemporalScanner’s accuracy is supported by more than 70 peer-reviewed published studies covering all ages from preterm infants to geriatrics and all care areas from hospitals to homes.

Grass Valley – Jeff Rosica, Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer
February 14, 2011









































Jeff Rosica
        






Q. What kind of products or services does your company offer for broadcasters? 

 Grass Valley manufactures and supports a wide variety of key products for broadcasters and high-end content producers.  These include standard-speed and Super Slo-Mo cameras; production switchers; automated production tools; automated content repurposing tools; editing systems for craft and news, servers for ingest, playback, replay and transmission; routing, infrastructure and modular products; converters; and IP distribution systems.  Recent product introductions include the Kayenne Video Production Center, K2 Dyno Replay System, LDK 8000 Elite cameras, and MediaFUSE to help broadcasters automatically repurpose their content for Web, mobile, and other non-broadcast delivery opportunities. As well, Grass Valley offers a comprehensive services portfolio which offers a complete range of cost-effective support solutions including commissioning, training, technical support, service agreements and remote monitoring.  Standard packages are available as well as customized programs for large and/or complex service level agreement programs.  With skilled broadcast engineers in more than 20 countries and local infrastructure in every major region, Grass Valley delivers the industry’s leading customer support and professional services offering.

Q. What’s new that you will you show at the NAB Show and that TV broadcasters should look for there?  

While I don’t want to give away all of the new products and solutions that Grass Valley will be showing at NAB, I will say that we are planning to have a number of products with major enhancements introduced in Las Vegas.  Specifically, for broadcasters, we will have a new version release for the Ignite Automated Production System with features requested by users, especially for those producing news.  New at NAB will also be key feature enhancements to our MediaFUSE content repurposing system to further assist broadcasters in repurposing their content for Web, mobile and other alternative delivery methods.  We will be showing our Kayenne Video Production Center working tightly with our LDK 8000 cameras and demonstrating the switcher controlling key functions on the cameras to allow for creative changes (such as star or soft filters moving in or out) to be linked directly to the switcher time line as well as to make simple level changes as needed.  Look for some big news around our very successful K2 Dyno replay product,as well as our K2 Summit server, and the Trinix NXT video routing system.  The NAB introduction of EDIUS 6 for craft editing and key updates to MEDIAEDGE that make it the perfect product for in-house distribution and off-air monitoring and recording.  If you’re a broadcaster or content producer I invite you to come by the Grass Valley booth and see how we can really help to make your business more efficient, as well as providing a better and more consistent product to your viewers.
Q. How is your new product offering different from what’s available on the market?

  In addition to working on making all of our user interfaces faster and more intuitive for the operators, one of our mandates at Grass Valley is to continue bringing all of our products together to enhance each product's functionality when paired with other Grass Valley products.  An example pointed out earlier is the Kayenne switcher controlling our cameras.  In addition, Kayenne is capable of a tighter integration with our K2 Summit and K2 Solo servers, as well as with our Trinix NXT and GeckoFlex systems.  We like to think of this as 1+1 = 3.  It’s an unfair advantage when placed in the broadcasters hands.  Specifically, we can talk about new enhancements to Ignite, our automated production system.  Once installed into a broadcast facility, Ignite allows an almost unheard of level of production automation and control providing the opportunity for broadcasters to easily add new news shows to provide new revenue streams for better bottom line performance.   Many of our new products and product enhancements are also allowing content producers that are on a limited budget to get an unheard of level of production quality not previously available at this price point.
Q. How has your company been affected by the current economic situation and what are you doing to get through it?

  Grass Valley, like most companies, definitely had some economic and business challenges due to the recent economic situation.  In addition to these external forces, Grass Valley was also put up for sale by our former parent company and had to work through 18 months of a few customers feeling uncertain about our future.  As of January 1, 2011 the Grass Valley purchase by technology group Francisco Partners is complete and we are once again an independent company and doing very well.  Our H2 in 2010 was much better than our projections and expectations and we have returned to being a profitable company and expect that to continue into the foreseeable future.

Q. Where are you based, and how many employees do you have? Anything else we should know about your company?  

Our corporate headquarters is now in San Francisco, while our factories and design centers are still located in Nevada City, California; Beaverton, Oregon; Woburn, Massachusetts; Salt Lake City, Utah; Kobe, Japan; and Breda, The Netherlands.  Our sales offices are located throughout the world in most of the top business centers in each country.  Today we are over 1,000 employees strong, and our focus is on designing and manufacturing products that help our customers to become more efficient in their current processes, as well as working together with them to bring products to market that will help them to grow and enhance their revenues as well.
