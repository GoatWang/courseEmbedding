03-Apr-2012 --- Short: "Henk Hoogenkamp's relationships with a large number of major global brands will assist us in the development of ingredient inclusion of our stabilized rice bran, defatted rice bran, rice bran oil and derivative products in a broad range of consumer products."

3 Arpil 2012 --- NutraCea, a global leader in the production and marketing of value added products derived from rice bran, has announced the appointment of Mr. Henk Hoogenkamp to the company's Board of Directors effective April 2, 2012.   Mr. Hoogenkamp has authored 9 books focused on the importance of dairy protein and vegetable protein in formulated foods, beverages and meat products. He has published over 500 articles in 14 languages discussing protein ingredient solutions. Mr. Hoogenkamp is a member of several strategic and technology advisory boards to global food and ingredient companies.   From 1990 to 2006 he served as a senior director strategic technology with Protein Technologies International, now The Solae Company, an alliance between Du Pont and Bunge. He previously served as the President of DMV-Campina USA, now Royal FrieslandCampina, the world's largest dairy protein operator.   In December 1996, Mr. Hoogenkamp received an honorary doctoral degree from the Institute of Sports Medicine, Bucharest, Romania, for his pioneering work on the effects of protein supplementation for elite sport performance. His new book "The Rice Bran Protein Factor" is due for publication September 2012.   "We welcome Henk to the NutraCea Board of Directors," said Mr. W. John Short, CEO of NutraCea. "He has been a strong supporter of NutraCea for several years. His knowledge of the dietary role of vegetable proteins in general, and our stabilized rice bran products specifically, will be invaluable to NutraCea as we continue to increase sales in all major global markets. Henk will participate with other Board members in setting strategy for our business and will assist senior management in the execution of our growth plans. His relationships with a large number of major global brands will assist us in the development of ingredient inclusion of our stabilized rice bran, defatted rice bran, rice bran oil and derivative products in a broad range of consumer products."   NutraCea has proprietary and patented intellectual property that allows us to convert rice bran, one of the world's most underutilized food sources, into a number of highly nutritious human food and animal nutrition products.  Last year NutraCea and BENEO-Remy, a world leader in functional food ingredients derived from rice, announced an exclusive, co-branded sales and marketing agreement. Under the terms of the Distribution and Cooperation Agreement entered into on September 29, 2011, NutraCea will produce stabilized rice bran (SRB) for exclusive distribution by BENEO-Remy under their "RemyLiVe" brand in over 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) as well as Russia, India, Australia and New Zealand.

Plant Protein Vision: Rice Bran Protein, Pea Protein, Soy Protein
In a world with rapidly increasing populations and a growing number of people moving up the food chain consuming grain-intensive animal proteins such as meat and dairy, changes are for real that a major disruption in food supplies is looming. Even now, some areas of the world can be seen as a "food bubble" which is the result of using unsustainable agricultural methods like overpumping of groundwater in order to keep farming yields to unrealistic inflated high levels.

Plant Protein & Disruptive Diagnostics: 

The Transformational Food Journey for Today's Future


Disruptive innovation for disrupted consumers, accelerated population growth, climate change, ecosystem degradation, energy- water- and land scarity are making today's food production increasingly unsustainable. Plant protein is one of the options going forward to build solid nutritional food solutions. 
There is a socio-demographic evolution ongoing of the family structure, higher education for women and most importantly the onslaught of diet-related diseases. The food landscape will substantially change and for the legacy food companies a fundamental shift is needed to survive in an effort to stop consumers from walking away from the most iconic food brands. Henk Hoogenkamp describes these many inter-connected variables in a charismatic fashion showing his lifelong true passion to make food healthier and more affordable.

Plant meat is niet langer wishful thinking (Dutch)
Als Meat&Co.-columnist heeft u Henk Hoogenkamp
al vaak voorbij zien komen binnen onze redactionele
kolommen. In zijn columns laat deze wereldwijd
gerespecteerde eiwitgoeroe zijn licht schijnen op
brandende ontwikkelingen binnen zijn vakgebied. read more 








What Client’s Say





Henk is one of my personal heroes because of his relentless pursuit of better ingredients to build better foods. He is a transparent visionary and his innovative research has inspired many of us in manufacturing to take the risks required to move the industry forward. He always presents a clear case for better, healthier ingredients and that distinguishes himself among his colleagues.



Chris SalmPh.D., President and Owner of Salm Partners, Denmark Wis., the largest U.S. co-extrusion company






Many years passed by since we first developed together innovative products for a company that was too big and too close minded to appreciate. Nevertheless, for me these moments have been extremely fullfilling and, no matter how fast the time goes, I will never forget.?I learned a lot from that experience, thanks to you, my dear true friend.



Fernando de MartinoMcDonald's -Manager Q&A Mid-East Region 






Through his interactions globally, Henk has shared his insights into functional food ingredients, as well as new food product trends around the world, with so many food technology professionals. I consider him an expert in the science of food proteins and emulsions. He understands the functional characteristics of meat, dairy and vegetable proteins and knows exactly how to use them in combination to complement each other.



Hsien-Hsin ChangPh.D., Director of R&D, ConAgra Foods






Henk is that rare individual who combines a practical understanding of food formulation with an acute insight into the global implications of food policies and individual choices. He is constantly searching for and sharing the best ways to deliver affordable nutrition to our ever-growing human population. Due to his exposure to worldwide culinary and sociopolitical realities, he can convey a compelling message to his readers. His works should be required reading for all food technologists, corporate managers, public policy makers and those individuals interested in affordable, sustainable nutrition.



Innocent UkabamPh.D., Senior Scientist, Danisco Co.






I have known Dr. Hoogenkamp as a colleague and as a food scientist for many, many years. Henk's vision is to maximize the utilization of all natural resources in feeding this world of hunger.



James RasekhPh.D., USDA-FSIS, Washington, DC






Henk is unique in that he caters to no one group [within the food industry]. He remains neutral and always provides an honest, trustworthy opinion. Most importantly, he looks to the future and focuses on the world’s exploding population to determine how we can better manufacture healthy foods to meet present and future demands to feed the world. I’ve heard him described as the Michael Jordan of meat science. When Henk Hoogenkamp talks, the industry listens.



Kody NewlandVice President of Sales and Marketing, NutraCea, Scottsdale, Ariz., the world's largest manufacturer stabilized rice bran






Henk Hoogenkamp is a mentor, someone who has the amazing foresight to translate sound technical information in food science into viable food business ventures. But most importantly, he is unselfish in sharing his knowledge of recent advances in food product development and processing. In meat processing, he is my sensei.



Maria Patricia V. AzanzaPh D, Professorial Lecturer in Food Science and Technology, University of the Philippines, and Vice President of R&D at Foodflow Inc.






Fleischwirtschaft is happy to deliver up-to-date information for our worldwide readers and you always help us to do so. It´s always very knowledge-enriching and a real pleasure to work with you.



Michael WeisenfelsEditor in chief, Fleischwirtschaft International -Frankfurt, Germany






Henk consistently predicts the challenges, the opportunities and future directions of the global food industry with astounding accuracy. He shares his knowledge couched in layman’s terms that the scientific, commercial and international communities can all understand and digest. His quarter century of leadership in this regard is without peer.



Mike ParrySales & Marketing Director, Kerry Canada






Henk is a world-class food technology expert who combines a deep understanding of food science—including food chemistry, microbiology and engineering—with the practical industry experience to design creative foods and food ingredients that fit the lifestyle and the budgets of consumers in these trying times. He has made available ingredients for use in both developed and developing countries to make delicious and nutritious meals within the reach of people who are often time- and resource-constrained. His work has made it possible to pack nutrients into foods to meet the requirements of young and old in all of the countries willing to utilize his innovative lifestyle foods.



Sonia de LeonPh.D., Professor of Food Science, the University of the Philippines






Henk has a great sense of what is going on in the food industry -- both current trends and developments that are destined to impact companies in the business in years to come. He always has valuable insights to share, and his counsel is something I take very seriously.



Yves PotvinFounder & President, Gardein Protein International, Vancouver BC Canada
