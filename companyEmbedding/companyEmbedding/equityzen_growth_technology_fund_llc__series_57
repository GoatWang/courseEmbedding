History[edit]
EquityZen was founded in 2013 by Atish Davda (CEO), Shriram Bhashyam, and Phil Haslett in New York City.[1][6][7] From its outset, EquityZen was designed to allow employees of private companies to sell their equity in the company to accredited investors.[4][8] The firm started out as part of the 500 Startups accelerator program in the fall of 2013.[9][10] The company received seed funding in January 2014[11] and as of September 2015 had raised Series A funding from undisclosed investors.[12][13] EquityZen has raised $6.5 million in outside financing, including a $3M injection in 2017 led by Tim Draper's Draper Associates.[14] The financial technology firm was recently mentioned in Forbes' Fintech 50 list.[15]
Service[edit]
EquityZen operates a marketplace in which employee shareholders in private companies can make their equity available to outside investors. In addition to traditional share transfers, EquityZen introduced a new offering in the private shares market by working with the issuer to register a transfer of shares so employees and early investors can sell a portion of shares for cash without having to wait until an IPO or acquisition.[1][16][17] The firm works exclusively with companies that have already raised capital from large, institutional investors.[3] Companies need to have at least $50 million in enterprise value to be listed on the marketplace.[18] The minimum investment amount for investors is $20,000.[3]
Financial Advisors, who manage capital on behalf of others, invest their clients' capital through the platform.[19] Investors outside of the US have invested in private companies.[20][21] EquityZen has transacted in over half of the largest 25 private Venture Capital-backed companies, such as prominent companies including Lyft, Evernote, and AppNexus.[1][22][23]

EquityZen is an online marketplace for trading pre-IPO employee shares from privately held companies.[1][2] The platform often links employees from private companies with investors who would not otherwise be able to invest in the company prior to an IPO.[3][4] EquityZen is based in Manhattan's Flatiron District.[5]

History[edit]
EquityZen was founded in 2013 by Atish Davda (CEO), Shriram Bhashyam, and Phil Haslett in New York City.[1][6][7] From its outset, EquityZen was designed to allow employees of private companies to sell their equity in the company to accredited investors.[4][8] The firm started out as part of the 500 Startups accelerator program in the fall of 2013.[9][10] The company received seed funding in January 2014[11] and as of September 2015 had raised Series A funding from undisclosed investors.[12][13] EquityZen has raised $6.5 million in outside financing, including a $3M injection in 2017 led by Tim Draper's Draper Associates.[14] The financial technology firm was recently mentioned in Forbes' Fintech 50 list.[15]
Service[edit]
EquityZen operates a marketplace in which employee shareholders in private companies can make their equity available to outside investors. In addition to traditional share transfers, EquityZen introduced a new offering in the private shares market by working with the issuer to register a transfer of shares so employees and early investors can sell a portion of shares for cash without having to wait until an IPO or acquisition.[1][16][17] The firm works exclusively with companies that have already raised capital from large, institutional investors.[3] Companies need to have at least $50 million in enterprise value to be listed on the marketplace.[18] The minimum investment amount for investors is $20,000.[3]
Financial Advisors, who manage capital on behalf of others, invest their clients' capital through the platform.[19] Investors outside of the US have invested in private companies.[20][21] EquityZen has transacted in over half of the largest 25 private Venture Capital-backed companies, such as prominent companies including Lyft, Evernote, and AppNexus.[1][22][23]

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!
                        

S.S.
Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

            Investment opportunities posted on this website are “private placements” of securities that are not publicly traded, are subject to holding period requirements, and are intended for investors who do not need a liquid investment.
            Private placement investments are NOT bank deposits (and thus NOT insured by the FDIC or by any other federal governmental agency), are NOT guaranteed by EquityZen Securities, and MAY lose value.
            Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority has recommended or approved any investment or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information or materials provided by or through the website.
            Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

            Any investment information contained herein has been secured from sources EquityZen believes are reliable, but we make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy of such information and accept no liability therefore.
            Offers to sell, or the solicitations of offers to buy, any security can only be made through official offering documents that contain important information about risks, fees and expenses.
            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

In Our Clients' Words




                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!
                        

S.S.
Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.
                        

Lucas
ex-employee, billion-dollar private company^




                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

This must be accomplished in a manner that keeps the focus on company growth, the number one priority for all stakeholders. Investors that previously couldn't access late-stage private companies due to investment minimums, can now invest in private growth companies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
