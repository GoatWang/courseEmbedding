About Us








NIELSEN FAMILIES





We have measured what people watch, buy, and listen to for decades.
We launched our radio measurement service in 1942, and began measuring television audiences in 1950. Much of our knowledge and data comes directly from consumers themselves, via Nielsen Families. Nielsen Families are the key to our data’s authenticity, and we offer consumers a range of opportunities to provide us with feedback about their shopping and media use, some of which you may have already heard about.
The opinions and experiences of all Nielsen panelists, including Nielsen Families, enrich our view of the marketplace and ensure that our research accurately reflects consumers' shopping and media habits.
You may be, or have already been, invited to be a part of Nielsen research, and we encourage you to accept our invitation.
Learn more about Nielsen.
See how we've grown since the 1920's.


What exactly are the TV Ratings?
Many people are familiar with Nielsen because of our TV Ratings. TV Ratings play a significant role because they tell the media and advertising communities how many people watched a specific program—key information for everyone from brands to advertisers to television networks.
In its most basic sense, a TV Rating is the percentage of a specific population that watched a particular piece of content or ad. In the television realm, this can be anything from a network comedy to a sports telecast to a news network during a given time.


Why should my family be a Nielsen Family?
By becoming a Nielsen Family, you are able to…











Have your voice heard and represent your community in the TV Ratings.
When you become a Nielsen Family, your participation helps the media and advertising communities know which programs you and people like you watch.









Keep your information confidential.
Your participation as a Nielsen Family is confidential, and no one is identified in the TV Ratings.









Receive our thanks.
Being a Nielsen Family costs you nothing! In fact, as a thank you, you’ll receive gifts for your continued participation in the Nielsen TV Ratings.






We value your contribution, and we protect your privacy.
Our analysis and insights help to inform the decision-making processes of brands and content providers as well as the research activities of universities, and more. Your participation is important to these organizations and their role as influencers and drivers of the consumer experience.
We value your contribution, and we protect your privacy. Nielsen will never use your personally identifiable information to advertise, promote or market third-party goods or services to you. We will not license, publish or sell any information we collect from you that can be tied to an individual user such as your name, email address, postal address, etc.


How and why was my home selected?
Homes are scientifically selected to be representative of cities across the United States. First, a county within a state is selected. Next, within that county, a group of block areas are chosen. Specially selected homes within that block area are then contacted to participate as Nielsen Families.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (EN ESPAÑOL)


The Nielsen Process




How do I become a member of the Nielsen sample?



Strictly through chance. We cannot ask every home to participate, so we carefully select a sample of homes in your community to represent the entire TV audience. To be statistically accurate, it is essential that our samples be randomly selected. Every household in the U.S. has a chance of being selected, no matter where it is located.




I work in the TV industry (at a TV station, TV network, radio station, radio network, a cable TV company or a satellite provider). Can I still be part of the survey if Nielsen contacts me?



No, unfortunately not. We are sorry, but our guidelines prohibit us from including homes where a household member is employed by, or is a principal owner in the television or media industry.






TO JOIN OUR METERED PANEL




I received a large envelope from Nielsen. Is this legitimate?



Yes, the envelope may have contained either a short survey about television viewing that we would like you to complete and return in the postage-paid envelope, or the envelope may have contained a letter inviting you to participate in the Nielsen television ratings.




What if a Nielsen representative visits my home?



Our Field Representatives are highly trained professionals who want the chance to tell you about the exciting opportunity to participate in the Nielsen ratings. All of our Representatives carry a Nielsen photo ID badge to identify them. If you are unsure about the person at your door, you may call us at 1-800-237-6493.




Meter not working? Have technical questions?



Contact us. Our representatives are available to answer your questions, whenever they may arise.




Lost your Nielsen representative’s contact information?



Call 1-800-237-6493 and provide the Nielsen representative with your name and Nielsen HH ID number.






To Complete a Diary




I received a letter or postcard from Nielsen. Is this legitimate?



We do send letters and postcards to potential participants from our production facility in Florida. It is our way of introducing ourselves, in hopes that you will fill out the television diary soon to come.




I received a large envelope from Nielsen. Is this legitimate?



Yes, every year we mail over one million paper diaries to randomly selected sample households across the U.S. in both First Class and Priority Mail envelopes. Nielsen rigorously controls how the diaries are packaged and delivered to the U.S. Post Office for mailing. If you have further questions about an envelope you received from us, please call toll free, 1-800-237-8611.




How can I be sure the person calling is really a Nielsen representative?



First, our interviewers will always identify themselves by name and as a representative of The Nielsen Company. Please feel free to double-check and verify that we placed the call to you or your telephone number. You may call us on this toll-free number: 1-800-237-8611.






ESPECIALLY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS




Why am I as a college student so important to Nielsen?



Your family was selected to participate in the Nielsen TV Panel. Even though you are currently living away from home you are still part of the family. It is important for you to continue your normal viewing and have it taken into account. Our Nielsen TV Ratings information lets TV, cable networks and local TV stations know how their programming is doing.




What are you measuring?



We measure what TV programs are being watched in your dorm or home by all persons, and do the same with others across the country.




Is this information kept private?



Your information is transmitted directly to our servers and not shared with other panelists. Keeping your viewing information confidential is very important to us; we do not disclose any personal data collected.




What’s in it for me?



As well as representing your community in the TV ratings, you will receive a gift for your participation. All we want you to do is to watch TV like you normally would.






MY PRIVACY




How did you get my contact information?



Nielsen uses a combination of publicly available telephone, address, and Census information to select homes for our diary and meter panels.




Will Nielsen sell my name and address to marketers? Is Nielsen going to try to sell me something?



Absolutely not. The information from your home is held strictly confidential. You will never be approached by anyone selling something because you participated in one of our surveys.














Feedback from former panelists
"What would I say to someone who is thinking of becoming a Nielsen Family? 100% go for it."

Journal of Measurement


The world of measurement is changing

Behind every piece of data at Nielsen, behind every insight, there’s a world of scientific methods and techniques in constant development. And we’re constantly cooperating on ground-breaking initiatives with other scientists and thought-leaders in the industry.




Reports

The Nielsen Total Audience Report: Q1 2017 There are many influences that can sway consumer media habits—from where they live to their income levels to when they were born. We also see much different consumption habits across generations. 
U.S. Music Mid-Year Report 2017 The Nielsen Music Mid-Year Report provides the definitive figures and charts for the music industry from the first six months of 2017.
Total Consumer Report Deflation, channel shifts, categories falling out of favor with consumers and many other factors have contributed to what appears to be an unprecedented slowdown in growth across FMCG and retail. But, as they say, appearances can be deceiving. Because, as it turns out, growth is still there, it’s just happening in many, new places.

Tool Care



 No. 62 Low Angle Jack Plane
Patterned after the Stanley No. 62, the Low Angle Jack Plane is one of our most versatile and outstanding planes. The massive blade is set bevel-up in the milled bed at 12°, giving you maximum support of the cutting edge and a low angle of attack. The precise depth adjuster, moveable shoe for adjustment of the mouth opening, and the hefty blade allow you to tackle the most difficult jobs with the power of a Jack or the finesse of a Smoother.

14" long. Blade is 2" wide x .175" thick, bedded at 12°.
Iron body, Bronze cap. Weight 4.55 lbs.

The trick to getting the most out of this plane is to have multiple blades honed to different angles for a variety of tasks.
For example: 25° for end grain work, 33° for smoothing, 38° for tackling wavy grain with less tear out, a Toothed Blade for aggressive removal of material with less effort, and a 90° Scraper Blade.
Our optional 'Hot Dog' attaches to the side of the plane and makes shooting more comfortable. Powder-coated aluminum.

Please note: Tool Sets can take up to two weeks for our shop to assemble and ship.

Low Angle Jack Plane

The Lie-Nielsen Low Angle Jack Plane is based on the Stanley No. 62,
one of the three large format low angle block planes that Stanley made.
At 14" long, the No. 62 was the largest. It was produced between 1905
and 1942*. It is often referred to as a butcher’s block plane, giving you
an idea of one use it was designed for. It features an adjustable mouth
and a 12° blade angle in a full-size bench plane scale. The 62 is useful
in a wide variety of jobs, from rough work to smoothing, and our
version with the 3/16" blade and heavy Ductile Iron body casting is an
outstanding performer.
For the best finishes, use a very sharp blade set to take a fine cut. The
mouth opening should be no larger than necessary to pass the chip.
When you want to cut more aggressively, open the mouth more and
advance the blade for a deeper cut. For best results on end grain, set the
blade and mouth fine.
Geometry: 
The blade sits in the body at 12°; it comes with a 25° flat
ground bevel, making the included cutting angle 37°.
Blade Sharpening: The blade comes ready to use. Slight additional
honing will increase performance. A secondary bevel of up to 5 degrees
helps achieve a razor edge quickly. You can find further sharpening
instructions in a printable PDF format on our website:  Sharpening Instructions PDF

Mouth Adjustment:
Hold the tool in one hand and loosen the front
knob about 1/4 turn. Adjust with the brass lever. Tighten the knob again
firmly, but do not overtighten.
Blade Adjustment:
Blade adjustment is simple, direct and positive.
Hold the tool in one hand with your thumb on the cap. Loosen the cap
iron thumbscrew all the way, then tighten slightly until there is a little
resistance. Adjust depth of cut with the stainless steel nut. Sight down
the base of the tool from the front, and judge depth and squareness
of blade by the thin dark line of the blade showing against the sole as
it protrudes. When you are done, snug the cap thumbscrew. Do not
overtighten. Make sure the mouth is adequately open before advancing
the blade to avoid damaging the edge.
Lateral Adjustment:
The Low Angle Jack Plane intentionally has very
little lateral adjustment of the blade. This is an advantage. As you adjust
the blade, it will track squarely with the sole. The disadvantage is that
you must sharpen the blade square. Today there are many good jigs on
the market that make this easy to do. If you find that you don’t like this
feature, you can grind the blade narrower to give more lateral play.
*John Walter, Antique and Collectible Stanley Tools: Guide to Identity and Value, Second Edition, The Tool Merchant, 1996.

Materials:
The body is cast from Ductile Iron, a very strong alloy that
will take a lot of abuse. These castings are fully stress-relieved, a process
that removes inherent stresses and ensures that the tool will remain
flat and true. The cap is Manganese Bronze. Other parts are Brass, Steel
and Cherry.
The blade is 3/16" A-2 cryogenically treated Tool Steel, double tempered
to Rockwell 60-62. Our heat treating technique ensures that the blade
will take and hold a very fine edge for a long time. After heat treating,
the blade is fully surface ground on the top, back, and cutting edge,
giving a smooth, flat surface that will take a mirror finish very quickly.
The thick blade provides solid chatter-free cutting.
Maintenance:
The sole is ground flat to .0015" or less. Occasional hand
lapping with fine wet/dry sandpaper (320 grit or higher) on a flat surface
like a glass plate, will help remove dings and keep it true. The cap iron
can be polished with any good brass polish, or allowed to patina with
age and use. Occasionally, the tool should be disassembled, cleaned, and
moving parts oiled. The blade should be kept lightly oiled to prevent
rust, especially when the tool is not in use. We recommend Camellia or
Jojoba oil - vegetable oil based products. They are non-toxic, odor-free
and easy to use. Also, in our shop, we use a fine abrasive handblock to
remove any light surface oxide from tool bodies and blades. Camellia &
Jojoba oils and abrasive handblocks are available from us.
Guarantee:
Materials and workmanship are guaranteed for the life of your tool. Call for repairs or replacement parts. We are available for advice if you ever have a problem using your tool.
Proposition 65 Notice:
Bronze and brass alloys contain lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects, or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.

 No. 5 Jack Plane
Jack Planes excel at a large variety of tasks, such as removing milling marks or the scallops of a scrub plane. The No. 5 is built for hard work and will quickly flatten surfaces for the finer set planes to follow. 
14" long.
Blade is 2" wide x .125" thick. 
Iron body only, 5-1/2 lbs.

Bench Planes
Lie-Nielsen Bench Planes (except for the No. 1) are based on the Stanley Bedrock-type planes. Bedrocks were Stanley’s top line of Bench Planes, heavier and better made than the standard. In addition, the construction of the frog is unique — it features a fully machined fit between frog and body, adjustable from the rear without having to remove the blade and cap. This allows you to easily change the mouth setting from a coarse to fine cut for difficult woods or fine smoothing passes.
Geometry:
All Bench Plane blades are bedded at 45° with the bevel down. 
Blade Sharpening:

Your Lie-Nielsen Bench Plane is ready to cut wood out of the box. The blade is ground sharp at a 25° bevel. A secondary bevel of up to 5 degrees helps achieve a razor edge quickly.  This also improves edge life in hardwoods.  For more information on advanced sharpening we suggest David Charlesworth’s DVD Hand Tool Techniques Part 1: Plane Sharpening.
Mouth Adjustment:
To adjust the mouth opening, loosen the two locking screws at the back of the frog; then turn the middle adjuster screw. Observe the opening in front of the blade. When it is correct, set the locking screws again.
Chipbreaker:
Our  Chipbreaker  is 1/8" thick. The raised lip under the bevel of the chip-breaker is back beveled 1° to ensure that the leading edge contacts the blade firmly. You should never need to dress this surface, but if you do, use a very fine stone and be sure to maintain the angle. The 25° bevel may be honed occasionally. For general work, set the end of the chipbreaker about 1/16" from the cutting edge of the blade; for the finest smoothing work, set it  closer to the edge.
Blade Adjustment:
To advance the blade, turn the adjuster nut clockwise.  It is always a good idea to finish adjusting the blade by a forward adjustment to take up backlash and to prevent the blade from moving.  In order to be able to adjust the blade easily, do not overtighten the lever cap screw.
Materials:
Iron tools are cast from Ductile Iron, a very strong alloy that will take a lot of abuse. These castings are fully stress relieved, a process that removes inherent stresses and ensures that the tool will remain flat and true.
The blade is A-2 cryogenically treated Tool Steel, hardened to Rockwell 60-62 and double tempered. Our heat treating technique ensures that the blade will take and hold a very fine edge for a long time. After heat treating, the blade is fully surface ground on the top, back, and cutting edge, giving a smooth, flat surface that will take a mirror finish very quickly. The thick blade provides solid chatter-free cutting. The cap is Manganese Bronze.

Maintenance The soles of Iron planes are surface ground flat and square; the Bronze planes are lapped to a tolerance of .0015". Depending on how much use your tool gets, an occasional light sanding with 320 grit or finer wet/dry paper on a flat surface will keep the sole in as-new condition. Tools with Iron bodies should be kept lightly oiled or waxed to prevent rust. We recommend Jojoba Oil, a vegetable oil based product. It is non-toxic, odor-free and easy to use. Also, in our shop, we use a fine abrasive handblock to remove any light surface oxide from tool bodies and blades. Jojoba Oil Oil and abrasive handblocks are available from us.

A light oiling on the threaded rod, the Brass adjuster nut and the lateral blade adjustment lever will keep them moving freely. Many people like the patina that Bronze gets with age and use, but if you wish to keep the finish bright, a little brass polish is in order. The Cherry knob and handle are finished with wiping varnish and should require no maintenance.
Guarantee:
Materials and workmanship are guaranteed for the life of your tool. Call for repairs or replacement parts. We are available for advice if you ever have a problem using your tool.
Proposition 65 Notice:
Bronze and brass alloys contain lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects, or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.

Bench Planes








Bench Planes

Bench PlanesThese solid tools will give excellent results in the most demanding conditions. Precisely made, fit and finished, all Lie-Nielsen planes are ready for use right out of the box with minimal honing required.All of our Bench Planes have Manganese Bronze caps and frogs, and Cherry knobs and handles, hand shaped and buffed to a silky smooth finish. The soles of our planes are machine ground flat and square to .0015" or better, regardless of length.Blades are cryogenically treated A2 tool steel, double tempered to Rockwell 60-62. Blades are shipped with a flat ground 25° bevel. For longer edge life in abrasive or hard woods, increase the bevel angle up to 30° or 35°. This is quickly accomplished by honing a small secondary bevel.FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTIONThe mid-sized planes are best for roughing work. These include the No. 5, 5½, 6, 10¼, 62, and 610. The longest planes are designed for flattening. These include the No. 7, 8, and 7½. The shortest, widest planes are ideal for finishing. These include the No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4½, ﻿and 164.

Standard Bench Planes


We make all sizes that Stanley once did, from the tiny No. 1 to the huge No. 8. Each has its own charm, but personal preference plays a large part in choosing the right bench plane for a particular job.
Our Standard Bench Planes (except for the No. 1) are based on the Stanley Bedrock design,
last produced in 1943. In their golden years, the Bedrocks were the top of the line. They featured a fully machined mating fit between the frog and body, and the ability to adjust the mouth opening from the rear without removing the cap and handle. Lie-Nielsen Bench Planes include these features as well as a Bronze cam lever cap, lateral adjustment, and spinwheel blade adjuster.
The frog design is unique—a fully machined mating fit between the frog and the body. The design also allows precise and easy adjustments of the mouth opening from the rear without having to remove the cap and blade.
The optional High Angle Frog converts the blade angle from 45° to 50° (York Pitch) and 55° (Middle Pitch). This makes smoothing in difficult woods easier.

Product Development

Our leading-edge development strategies put your product offerings in prime position to succeed.

















Innovate for Growth
We all know how important innovation is to drive growth in consumer products companies. However, less than 0.5% of all new products that launch achieve enduring breakthrough performance. How do you rise to the top?
Nielsen helps you consistently achieve better innovation outcomes, faster and more efficiently. We offer solutions for every stage of the innovation process—from identifying profitable unmet opportunities and screening and optimizing concepts to testing products and package designs, accurately forecasting sales and optimizing pricing and product line assortment.
We bring you more than 35 years of BASES heritage as the gold standard in forecasting and predicting in-market success, an extensive database of success norms based on 200,000 global tests and 2,000 validations and consistent methodology and harmonization across 68 markets. Through our acquisition of Affinnova, these benefits are now enhanced by industry-leading collaboration and optimization tools, and a modern, fast, all-digital platform– all to help you make smarter decisions.
Our approach:

Identify profitable unmet opportunities with The Cambridge Group.
Optimize initiatives, evaluate the likelihood of in-market success and forecast within 9% accuracy of year one sales with our industry leading BASES solutions.
Find the best concept and package design for your product by evaluating and testing countless options simultaneously with Nielsen Optimizer. Our optimized concepts perform 4.4x better.
Understand if your current packaging is helping or hurt your product and develop better package designs quickly using Nielsen Category Design Audit and Nielsen Design Navigator.
Ensure you’ve got the right products on shelf at the right price with Assortment & Shelf and Trade Promotions.
Understand consumers’ subconscious to see how they respond to new product concepts and packaging with Consumer Neuroscience.












 Nielsen’s work with ball park led to breakthrough discoveries and helped us build strategies that were a radical departure from the past. The company’s consumer-centric approach helped us drive growth and gain the no. 1 standing in the hot dog category. 


-Philippe Schaillee
Chief Marketing Officer of Sara Lee North America Retail / Foodservice

					DESCRIPTION
				

					Also referred to as a Carriage Maker's Rabbet or Jack Rabbet Plane, this plane is the largest rabbet plane made. There have been several versions of this tool. This one is based on the Stanley 10-1/4, which has not been made since the Second World War!

It features cross-grain nickers and tilting knobs and handles. This tool is stout and has excellent balance. The corss0grain nickers cut grain fibers ahead of the blade to produce a clean, square vertical cut. 

We particularly like this tools for timber framing joinery. It is particularly well suited for timber framing because of it's size 12-3/4-in long, and 2-1/8-in wide and weight five pounds! This size gives it plenty of momentum and both front and rear totes (handles) pivot. Visit our blog to read an article we wrote about the Bench Rabbet Plane www.shelterbuild.com
