Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | C Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
Nationality of Foreign Officials:  
Chad, Guinea, Niger                    
Summary of Allegations: 
Samuel Mebiame, son of a former Gabonese prime minister and a prominent figure in South Africa, allegedly bribed government officials in Niger, Guinea and Chad to obtain natural-resources deals on behalf of Och-Ziff.
In 2003, Mebiame allegedly began working for Palladino Holdings Ltd. ("Palladino"), a Turks and Caicos investment firm founded by South African investor Olaf Walter Hennig. Mebiame later allegedly began working for Africa Management Ltd. ("Africa Management"), a joint venture created in 2008 between Och-Ziff and Palladino. Africa Management was created allegedly to act as a vehicle to invest in natural resource markets across Africa.
Mebiame was allegedly paid USD 3.5 million, as well as ownership stake in Africa Management, for providing various services to the joint venture, including alleged bribery of foreign officials in Chad and Niger. For example, Mebiame allegedly provided "nice cars" to a Niger public official, with an influence over another official responsible for assigning uranium mining licenses, along with a USD 100,000 payment to the official's charity. In addition, Palladino allegedly transferred more than USD 1.3 million to a company set up in 2007 by another Niger official involved in the alleged bribery scheme. Mebiame ultimately secured uranium concessions for the Africa Management.
In an alleged 2009 dispute over Mebiame's ownership interest in the joint venture, Mebiame allegedly threatened to expose Africa Management's involvement in the bribery scheme to both the authorities and media. The alleged dispute was ultimately resolved and Mebiame allegedly continued to work for the joint venture.

Och-Ziff and OZ Management
Beginning in 2011, Och-Ziff has received requests for information from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") in connection to whether the company may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA").  The authorities are concerned with an investment by Libya's government-run investment firm, Libyan Investment Authority, in some of the company's funds in 2007 and investments by some of the funds in a number of companies in Africa.
In April 2016, US authorities reportedly have wrapped up their bribery investigation into Och-Ziff and are in discussions with Och-Ziff over a possible criminal guilty plea and amount of potential financial sanctions. Although Och-Ziff reportedly attempted to settle with a deferred prosecution agreement, a guilty plea is reportedly being pushed by the DOJ as well a civil sanction up to USD 400 million reportedly being sought by the SEC.
In its Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on 3 May 2016, Och-Ziff disclosed that the company has recently begun discussion with the SEC and DOJ and it is probable for the authorities to purse civil and criminal sanctions.  In addition, Och-Ziff has disclosed its accrual of USD 200 million in connection with the matter and probability that amount of loss will be in excess of USD 200 million. 
In its Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on 2 August 2016, Och-Ziff disclosed an additional accrual of USD 214.3 million, totaling USD 414.3 million, in connection with the matter.
On 29 September 2016, the SEC disclosed that Och-Ziff will entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ that acknowledges responsibility for criminal conduct relating to SEC's findings in its cease-and-desist order, specifically to violating the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions. As part of the settlement, Och-Ziff agreed to pay a criminal penalty of USD 213,055,689 to the DOJ.
In addition, the SEC disclosed that OZ Africa Management, subsidiary of Och-Ziff, will also entered into a plea agreement with the DOJ related to the SEC's findings in its cease-and-desist order, specifically to violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

The SEC noted that the SEC is foregoing a one-time civil penalty of USD 173,186,178 against Och-Ziff based upon the imposition of criminal penalty by the DOJ in the amount of USD 213,055,689.
Furthermore, Och-Ziff agreed to engage and provide full cooperation to an independent monitor for a period of not less than thirty-six months.

Daniel Och
On 29 September 2016, Daniel Och, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, entered into cease-and-desist order to settle the charges that as Och-Ziff’s Chief Executive Officer, Och had final decision-making authority on all private investments by Och-Ziff, including the alleged improper transactions. Och personally approved the expenditure of funds in two transactions with Dan Gertler in the DRC in which bribes were paid. Those bribes were then inaccurately recorded as investments or loans on Och-Ziff’s books and records rather than bribe payments. Despite being aware of the high risk of corruption in transactions with Dan Gertler in the DRC in light of Gertler's reputation and connections to high level government officials, Och approved Och-Ziff to enter into each of these transactions. As a result, although Och did not knew that bribes would be paid, Och caused Och-Ziff’s books and records violations.
As part of the settlement, Och agreed to pay disgorgement of USD 1,900,000 and prejudgment interest of USD 273,718. The SEC noted that the amount of disgorgement reflected his estimated share of gain to Och-Ziff resulting from the DRC Partner transactions.

Joel M. Frank
On 29 September 2016, Joel M. Frank, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, entered into cease-and-desist order with the SEC to settle the charges that as Och-Ziff’s Chief Financial Officer, Frank was responsible for maintaining the accuracy of Och-Ziff’s books and records and for devising and maintaining Och-Ziff’s system of internal accounting controls. Frank approved the expenditure of Och-Ziff funds in transactions in which bribes or improper payments were made. Despite being aware of the high risk of corruption in transactions with Dan Gertler in the DRC in light of Gertler's reputation and connections to high level government officials, Frank authorized Och-Ziff to enter into each of these transactions. As a result, although Frank did not know that bribes would be paid, Frank caused the company’s books and records and internal controls violations.
As part of the settlement, Frank agreed to additional proceedings to determine whether civil penalties against Frank are in public interest. Furthermore, the SEC noted that Frank agreed that: he will be precluded from arguing that he did not violate the federal securities laws as described in the order; he may not challenge the validity of the order; hearing officer will accept the SEC's findings as true and valid; and hearing officer may determine the issues raised in the additional proceedings on the basis of affidavits, declarations, excerpts of sworn deposition or investigative testimony, and documentary evidence.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZ Management) is an American hedge fund manager and global alternative asset management firm.[1] The firm operates multiple investment strategies, including merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, equity restructuring, credit and distressed investments, private investments, and real estate.[2] It has 400 employees worldwide including offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Beijing.[3]
As of July 1, 2017, the firm has $31.8 billion in assets under management.[4][5]
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group was under investigation since 2011 in regard to the Foreign Corruption Practice Act (FCPA) for bribery and corruption in African countries over the period of 2008-2012.[6] On Thursday, September 29, 2016, following plea discussions, the company agreed to pay the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a total of $412 Million for criminal and civil violations.[7]
The terms of the SEC agreement meant that the company pled guilty to the charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bribing senior government officials in several countries in Africa.[8]
SEC found CEO Dan Och responsible for Och Ziff's corruption and bribery violations. According to their investigation, he and other company executives, including CFO Joel M. Frank, were aware of potential corruption and ignored the risks,[9] thus violating the anti bribery books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[10] Following the corruption charges and ensuing settlement, Och Ziff clients withdrew up to $13 billion from the company.[11]
On March 14, 2017 Bloomberg reported that several key executives had left the company including James Keith Brown, partner and head of investor relations, Paula Drake, chief compliance officer, and Drew Gillanders a top European equity analyst.[12]
On March 20, 2017 S&P Global Ratings cut Och-Ziff’s investment rating to junk status.[13][14]

Structure[edit]
According to the company website,[15] Daniel Och is Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer.
OZ Management is a subsidiary of Och-Ziff Capital Management.[16] In January 2008 OZ Management, Tokyo Sexwale’s Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig’s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.[16]
Mvela Holdings is a privately owned investment company founded in 1998 by Tokyo Sexwale, Mikki Xayiya and Mark Willcox. Mvela Holdings is the controlling shareholder of Mvelaphanda Group and has a significant interests in Mvelaphanda Resources.[17]
Palladino Holdings is based in Turks and Caicos in the British Virgin Islands.[18] 
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities.[16] Tokyo Sexwale, founder of Mvela, said: "We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.”[16] Africa Management Ltd., and OZ Management formed the foundation of Och-Ziff’s expansion and investment into natural resources in Africa.[19] The joint venture has investments in several African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Libya and Niger. Africa Management Ltd., was at the center of the SEC allegations, as well as ongoing investigations and corruption charges against OZ Management and Och-Ziff Capital Management.[20]  
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1994 by Daniel Och with financial support from the Ziff family, founders of Ziff Davis Media. William Ziff's sons Dirk, Robert, and Daniel manage the family's investments through Ziff Brothers Investments. Prior to founding the firm, Och was Head of Proprietary Trading in the Equities division at Goldman Sachs.[21]
The company completed an initial public offering in 2007, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at $32. The firm was one of the few hedge funds and private equity companies that completed IPOs before the market downturn of 2007. Also in 2007 it became a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[22] The company's stock has declined significantly since the IPO, reaching a 2008 year-to-date low of $4.02.[23] On September 30, 2010, the stock was trading at $14.90.[24]
The firm is reported to have avoided large losses during the financial crisis of 2008 and institutional capital continued to allocate funds to the company through 2010.[25]
Part of the success of the IPO was due to the efforts of Michael Cohen who joined the firm in 1997 and moved to London to establish European investments and operations. At the time of the IPO, Cohen was among the top three highest paid employees of Och-Ziff.[26] He led the expansion into private equity investments and broadened the firm’s global reach, specifically with the strategic partnerships in Africa,[27] most notable of which is Africa Management Ltd. (AML).
During the SEC investigation, Och-Ziff distanced itself and laid much of the blame and corruption charges at the feet of two executives at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group - Cohen and his colleague Vanja Baros.[28][29][30]  
However, even before Palladino and Mvela joined Och-Ziff to form AML, Och-Ziff loaned over $86 million to Walter Hennig, owner of Palladino, ostensibly to secure mining rights in Niger and Chad. According to the SEC investigation a portion of the funds were used to bribe senior government officials to facilitate the asset acquisition.[31]
On January 26, 2017, The SEC charged Cohen and Baros with leading an extensive bribery scheme that violated the FCPA.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the two caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level African government officials. As a result of their purported actions, the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund invested in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also allegedly worked to secure mining deals by bribing government officials in Niger, Congo, Chad, and Guinea.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Zimbabwe[edit]
In August 2012 the Mail & Guardian reported that Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings, a joint venture between Tokyo Sexwale and OZ Management, was behind a USD100 million loan to the Zimbabwean political party Zanu-PF.[33]
Guinea[edit]
Och-Ziff and AML have been implicated in an investigation into election rigging[34]  which helped President Alpha Conde into power, and led to revisions in the Guinean mining code.[35][36] In August 2016, Samuel Mébiame was arrested by U.S federal prosecutors on bribery and corruption charges[37]  involving several African countries and connected to his ties with Hennig[38]  and the redrafting of the Guinean mining code. In his testimony, Mébiame admitted to bribing officials in Guinea.[39] Mébiame reported that he informed all partners in AML, including Och-Ziff that he had access to Guinea’s mining opportunities.[40][41] 
Palladino Holdings and Mvelaphanda Holdings, affiliates of OZ Management, are connected to a corrupt $25 million loan scheme that Palladino paid to the state of Guinea in order to start up a state mining company in exchange for mining rights.[42]
Democratic Republic of Congo[edit]
Loans to companies in the DRC by Och-Ziff resulted in a criminal penalty against OZ Management,[43] effectively Och-Ziff Capital Management.[44][45] 
Libya [edit]
According to an investigation run by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,[46] in 2007, the Libyan Investment Authority, which was controlled by Moammar Gadhafi, made a $300 million investment in Och-Ziff funds. To win this investment Och-Ziff paid Mohamad Ali Ajami, a London-based businessman with ties to Gadhafi. The money was funneled to the officials of Gadhafi's regime in order to seal the deal. Och-Ziff paid the fee knowing that it would be used for bribery. According to the charges, these dealings were overseen by head of European investing Michael L. Cohen.[30] In Och-Ziff's books and records, the broker's fee was noted vaguely as "Professional Services - Other."[47]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
