This collection of short stories span a variety of themes and lengths. They include a bit of humor, mystery, drama and whimsy while hopefully being enjoyable and thought provoking. Included are:  • The Cosmic Court: a whimsical story; a little truth - a little fun.  • Boom!!!: a touch of drama with a not so surprising ending.  • Reincarnation: a bit out there, originated from personal ponderings.  • Bedfellows: unlikely hospital patients share a room and life views.  • Options: None: an antihero spy thriller.  • The Albatross: a youthful infatuation becomes a lifelong burden.  • Dinner Talk: friends ponder an unlikely couple over dinner.  • Miss Prim: a proper young lady is introduced to the real world.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.

About the Designer

Bernard James
Designer Bernard James’ eponymous accessories line began in the fall of 2010.  The brand was born out of the need for sophisticated but transitional pieces that could suit a man’s entire lifestyle. His belief that accessories should complement, not overpower, the wearer is demonstrated by strong statement pieces that lend themselves to be worn in a variety of ways. Bernard creates with a focus on quality, craftsmanship, and individuality. The accessories are all composed of solid sterling silver and smooth genuine leather. Every component, from the clasps to the links, is crafted, cast, cleaned, polished, and finished traditionally by hand in New York City. An amalgam of this traditional technique and a modern concept makes each piece not only an adornment, but also a work of art.

It’s a Guy Thing. As most of my work has a heavy romantic component, I decided to compile those stories which would hopefully appeal to the testosterone afflicted. They include a bit of humor, mystery, drama and action while hopefully being enjoyable.  Included are: • The Cosmic Court: a whimsical story; a little truth - a little fun. • Boom!!!: a touch of drama with a not so surprising ending. • The Game: a plane crash, a mountain man, some celebrities, an unexpected ending. • Options: None: an antihero spy thriller. •  Forever Bound: An action sequel to Options None.

About Us – Bernard & Associates
























A Food Brokerage Company








About Us



Mission: To offer quality food ingredients with a high level of personalized customer service. We believe it is important to stay informed of the ever-changing trends in the food industry and strive to continue to add new products to meet the increasingly diverse needs of the food industry.
James Bernard established Bernard & Associates LLC in 2012 in partnership with his wife, Sharon Bernard, and daughter, Angela Mongeon.
Bernard & Associates Team
With Jim’s strong sales skills, Angela’s focus on customer service and business management, and Sharon’s financial management expertise, Bernard & Associates is a food broker that you can rely on to offer quality products with the best service and effective sales strategies.


James Bernard

James Bernard is an owner/manager of Bernard & Associates and serves as the sales manager. With over 30 years of sales experience (over 20 in the food industry), Jim has developed very strong and effective sales skills. He has established lasting relationships with major accounts in the food industry during the last two decades.
Jim began his career as a public school teacher but a moonlighting experience led to his first entrepreneurial venture, an auto accessory distributorship. This distributorship grew to become the largest custom auto accessory business in Vermont and attained the highest sales of Clarion car stereos per capita in the nation. As a result of this success, Jim was appointed by Clarion Corporation to serve on their national sales and marketing board.
When Jim’s brother, Stephen Bernard, started Cape Cod Potato Chips, Stephen’s success perked Jim’s interest in the food industry. Jim began as a distributor for Cape Cod Potato Chips and later started his own food manufacturing business, Vermont Country Foods, which made all-natural frozen cookie dough. Jim successfully marketed his product to Stop & Shop, Price Chopper, Purity Supreme (since purchased by Shaw’s), Grand Union, and Hannaford’s Supermarkets.
As an Account Manager for Metarom, a small flavor house in Canada, Jim increased their sales in the Northeastern United States from a few thousand dollars to over one million in his first year. Within three years his sales were 50% of all company sales in the United States. By cold calling, Jim established accounts with large companies such as HP Hood, Ben & Jerry’s, Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, Smucker’s, Cabot Creamery and New England Confectionery Company (NECCO).
Jim was once told by a customer that he was “hot-wired for sales”. He has the ability and proven track record to cold call, identify the decision maker, and close the sale.
Jim’s favorite past-times are fishing and routing for the Irish (Notre Dame) sports teams. He also enjoys growing organic vegetables in a garden that is shared by three generations of his family.


Angela Mongeon
Angela Mongeon is an owner/manager of Bernard & Associates. Her responsibilities include business management with a focus on quality customer service. Angela is a Physical Therapist and mother of two young children. Her profession in the health care field as well as her role as a mother has driven her interest in healthy foods. She is excited to see the trend in the food industry moving toward more nutritious options. Angela became interested in sharing a role in the family business as she welcomes the opportunity to play a part in bringing better food options to consumers.
Angela enjoys spending her free time with her husband and two young children enjoying the best of what Vermont life has to offer including skiing, biking, swimming, gardening, and being in the great outdoors.


Sharon Bernard

Sharon is one of the Bernard & Associates owner/managers. Her primary role is financial management. She has a master’s degree in administration from Saint Michael’s College and over 30 years experience in financial management.
Her varied background includes positions as

controller of family-owned businesses
treasurer and controller of Equity Services (a broker-dealer and registered investment advisor affiliate of National Life Insurance Company)
chief financial officer of Central Vermont Community Action Council (a large non-profit with a $16 million budget that has been serving Vermonters in need since 1964)

Sharon has three years experience in the food industry including two as the controller and business manager for Vermont Country Foods, a food manufacturer.
Sharon loves spending time with her family – especially her grandchildren. Music also is an important part of Sharon’s life. She has a degree in music from the University of Vermont and enjoys teaching piano, playing the piano with instrumentalists, and accompanying singers at her church.
Promoting healthy foods is one of Sharon’s strong interests as she has personally benefited greatly from improving her diet and nutrition. She hopes that many of the products offered by Bernard & Associates will help consumers reap these same benefits.

About the Designer

Bernard James
Designer Bernard James’ eponymous accessories line began in the fall of 2010.  The brand was born out of the need for sophisticated but transitional pieces that could suit a man’s entire lifestyle. His belief that accessories should complement, not overpower, the wearer is demonstrated by strong statement pieces that lend themselves to be worn in a variety of ways. Bernard creates with a focus on quality, craftsmanship, and individuality. The accessories are all composed of solid sterling silver and smooth genuine leather. Every component, from the clasps to the links, is crafted, cast, cleaned, polished, and finished traditionally by hand in New York City. An amalgam of this traditional technique and a modern concept makes each piece not only an adornment, but also a work of art.
