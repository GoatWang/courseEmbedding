NOTE: Pinnacle offers mobile banking as a free service. Your wireless provider may charge for data usage. Please consult with your provider to determine what these charges will be. The "Enroll Now" and "Demo" buttons below are for Pinnacle's online banking service, not for mobile banking.





Make Payments
Our free BillPay services allow you to schedule one-time, occasional or recurring payments. With our service you can:
Pay virtually any bill – from your cable to the guy who mows your lawn – in one easy, secure location. 
Never be late again. Enter the date your bill is due and we'll make sure it gets there on time. We'll debit your account on the due date. You can even set up bill reminders and payment confirmations that are emailed to you.
Expedite payments. When needed, you can also make same-day payments or send overnight checks for a nominal fee to ensure bills are paid on time.
Pay other people. In the "Popmoney" tab, you can pay individuals using only their email address or mobile phone number for a small fee.
Go paperless. Sign up for e-Bills on many services – such as Comcast Cable – so you can receive the bill directly in online banking. 



Personal Financial Manager (PFM)
With PFM, you can track all of your accounts--savings, checking, mortgage, investments and even those outside of Pinnacle--in one place. We even offer a MoneyMobile app so you can see everything from your phone or tablet. 

PFM is fully integrated into Pinnacle's Online Banking, so you know your information is secure.
It's easy to enroll--just log into Online Banking, click the "PFM" tab and follow the steps to get started. If you are not an online banking user, you can find a demo and enrollment instructions below.
To begin using the MoneyMobile capabilities, download the MoneyMobile app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play store. The app will prompt you to get an activation code within PFM. Simply click the setting icon, go to the Mobile Devices tab and generate an access code.   



Security
From account information to personal data, the internet has become a key place for criminals to get information. The good news is there are simple ways you can safeguard your online accounts and personal computers. See our online library of resources on how to protect yourself from fraud. Pinnacle's online banking program carries several levels of security.
Secure connection. Your data is scrambled as it travels from our computer to your computer. All online banking pages use the highest standard of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption available to prevent thieves from accessing your banking data.
Password protected. The importance of picking a good, secure password can't be emphasized enough. The objective when creating a password is to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to make an educated guess about what you have selected. Here are some tips for creating a strong password:

Make it lengthy. Each character you add increases the protection.
Combine letters, numbers and symbols. The greater variety of characters you have, the harder it is to guess.
Avoid sequences or repeated characters. 12345678, 222222, abcdefg, or adjacent letters on your keyboard.

Security questions. We'll recognize the computers you use frequently. If we don't recognize the computer trying to access your accounts – say you've logged in from work or removed cookies from your existing web browser – we'll require a correct answer to your challenge questions before allowing access.
Advance features. Finally, the online banking site is protected by the most advanced firewalls and monitoring tools available on the market today. All of these features make online banking secure and safe.
Added security with Trusteer
We have teamed up with IBM to offer Trusteer Rapport—a leading provider of online fraud protection software. Trusteer Rapport "hardens" your browser and delivers an extra layer of security while you are signed into our site so cyber criminals can't read the pieces of information you type when you log in. Click here to download.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

About Us
Depending on the carrier, we can lay claim to all of those titles above. But, what do they mean? Simply put, they’re industry created designations, self-appointed titles, and a jumble of letters.
Here at Pinnacle, we’re about partnerships, not titles. We build partnerships with each and every agent. Whether you’re an independent broker working from home or a large agency working multiple states, we want you to join the Pinnacle team.
The deal is this: you sell and we take care of everything from submission to commission. Our toolkit is extensive. Once entered into our system, you have access to all of our carriers. Your information is securely stored and you can add additional carriers at any time. Never fill out contracting paperwork again!
