MineSense









Our Services
The MineSense Services group focuses on 3 main areas of service delivery to the industry:

Laboratory Services
Professional Services
Field Services and Support


Laboratory Services
MineSense has a fully-equipped mineral processing laboratory located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company offers a key suite of laboratory services focused on mineral sample evaluation for waste rejection & ore recovery by sensor-based methods. Test programmes offered include:

standard amenability tests which examine ores on a particle-by particle basis to develop grade distribution data, ideal grade/recovery curves and sensor calibration data for sensor based sorting
bulk amenability tests examine ores to assess discrimination between ore and waste, and between ore types on a batch basis. Approaches consider semi-bulk, bulk, and batch bulk sorting methods
Techniques deployed include electromagnetic methods for conductive/magnetic ore types, X-ray fluorescence for oxides and sulphides of base- and precious metals, as well as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for light elements and gangue mineralogy
All tests are supported by independent 3rd party assay through our partner ALS Chemex.


Professional Services
The economics of a MineSense deployment at a customer mine site can be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Payback is measured in months, rather than years. Professional services relating to a potential Solution deployment comprise value-added economic case studies, heterogeneity analyses, and Solution design:

Economic case studies considering the application of MineSense Solutions at customer sites can be undertaken. Bespoke in-house techno-economic evaluation tools Pre-CalculatOre and VIASIM® consider the revenue and cost impacts of a particular customer application. Using these tools and/or customer data and models, economic impacts at a project or operation deploying MineSense Technologies can be assessed.
Heterogeneity Analyses: evidence of ore/waste heterogeneity is masked by common orebody modelling and mine planning practices involving geostatistics and block modelling. Customers are therefore often unaware of heterogeneity present within their orebodies which can be exploited to recover ore from waste or alternately reject waste from ore within blocks in the model. Heterogeneity analysis quickly focuses on marginal blocks within a model, and unpacks the geological data to reveal and quantify previously unrecognized ore recovery or waste rejection potential in this material.
Solution Design: MineSense is currently focussed on the deployment of ShovelSense and SortOre products in pilots and trials. Each successful product trial ideally leads to a complete Solution sale. MineSense offers customers professional services including flowsheet development, mass flow diagrams, cost estimation etc. in support of pre-feasibility or feasibility-level engineering studies considering deployment of a full-scale Solution.

Field Services
MineSense offers field services in support of its products. Field services comprise two main areas of delivery:

Pilots: delivery, installation, commissioning and operation of pilots or trials for up to 3 months at a customer site.
Product support: ongoing support of products at customer sites including remote monitoring and support, software and hardware upgrades, on-site maintenance and change-out services.

Our Products | MineSense

MineSense









Our Products
Our core technology is a fast, scalable, robust mineral sensing platform providing real time, online measurement and reporting of ore/waste content to a variety of customers. Sensing products are integrated into two distinct product lines: Shovel-based systems and Belt-based systems. Mineral telemetry is delivered internally to the ore diversion system if a belt-based system, or to shovel- and truck operators via the ore control and fleet management system in the case of Shovel-based systems. Comprehensively deployed, MineSense products combine to form the MineSense Solution for bulk ore recovery and/or waste rejection in large-scale base- and precious metal mines.




Sensors




The sensor suite inside all of our products comprises High Frequency ElectroMagnetic Spectroscopy (HFEMS) and High Speed X-Ray Fluorescent (HSXRF) technologies combined with laser telemetry to measure and report ore grade in real-time. Sensors deliver data in arbitrary digital format to a number of customers including decision support systems such as grade control and ore routing systems, or alternately large scale material handling systems which divert ore and waste in real time to the appropriate destination.
HFEMS is a penetrating field technology therefore giving volumetric grade measurement specifically in conductive, magnetic or paramagnetic ore types. The technology is robust (>12g rating), fast (~1ms), and flexible, with multi-channel and extended range options available for Run-of-Mine (ROM) applications. HSXRF is an adaptation of X-ray fluorescent spectrometry used for the elemental analysis of base- and precious metals in Run-of-Mine materials. The technology has been developed to be fast (~80ms), robust (>12g rating), flexible and scalable, with multiple channels and extended range of up to 1000mm suitable for ROM applications.









Shovel-based systems
ShovelSense™
ShovelSense is a real-time mineral telemetry and decision support system for surface or underground applications. It is a retrofit package installed in the dipper of surface shovels or into the scoop of underground machines such as scooptrams or LHD’s. The ShovelSense platform is used for:

Measurement of ore quality while material is being scooped into the dipper
Reporting of ore quality and type to the grade control/ore routing system
Real-time, online decision support for ore/waste dispatch decisions

ShovelSense systems interface with three key components of the production system:

Data from the short range mine plan is read and results from telemetry are compared to the plan and updated where necessary;
Real time ore quality readings are taken local to the shovel, and transmitted over industrial Wi-Fi or 3G to a variety of customers including the ore control system; and
Results of the grade measurement are compared to the Plan. Where existing dispatch instructions are correct these are simply confirmed. Where existing dispatch instructions are not correct these are updated and communicated to shovel/truck and belt operators in real time.

The system delivers effective bulk sorting capability for low-grade base- and precious metal applications at effectively zero cost.
Additional modalities are under development, such as tramp metal/missing tooth detection, integration of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for refractory applications, hyper spectral techniques for clay and mineral alteration detection.

Belt-based systems
SortOre™
The SortOre system fuses high-speed multi-modal, multi-channel sensing (HFEMS + HSXRF + laser) outputs to characterize conveyed ore and waste in real time. Communicating to a high-speed multi-channel electromechanical diversion system, ore can be diverted in bulk (i.e., all diverters acting in concert), semi-bulk (i.e., single diverter channel acting) or by-particle (diverters act with 25ms response time) to dispatch rocks in the ore stream to correct destinations based on sensor responses.
MineSense believes that its proprietary electromechanical diversion systems offer lower cost and more effective diversion of coarse minerals than alternative air-based systems. Pilot units operating at 20tph are commercially available, however designs for scaled systems of up to 2000 tph are in development. SortOre™ logically combines with ShovelSense™ systems to provide a second stage of ore recovery or waste rejection at an even finer resolution. Core applications are in nickel, copper and other base metal sulphides, and oxides such as iron ore, manganese and chromite. Precious metal applications, specifically in platinum, gold and rare earth metals, are under development.
BeltSense™
BeltSense™ is a sensing-only version of the SortOre system. Incorporating multiple channels of HFEMS and HSXRF with laser height telemetry for particle size compensation, and operating at extended range of up to 500mm from datum, BeltSense systems the grade of base- and precious metal ores fast and report this grade to a variety of customers including mine dispatch and the process control system. Used in conjunction with a weightometer, total ore value (Wt%) can also be reported. Instantaneous or aggregate data on ore grade is passed to the mill via TCP/IP for use as a process control variable. Use of this data can improve metal recoveries and reduce reagent consumption in the mill.

About Us

MineSense™ Technologies Ltd. is a British Columbia-based technology development and marketing company that enhances the sustainability of mining by improving the ore extraction and recovery process. MineSense provides a proven platform for the sensing and sorting of low-grade ore to an unprecedented level of precision.
Through the application of our pre-concentration methodology, the MineSense Solution can provide up to 20% margin enhancement due to decreased requirements for energy, water and chemicals.
As the emerging leader in mineral telemetry and ore upgrading solutions worldwide, MineSense has developed a pre-concentration methodology that:

Improves the economics of mining low-grade ores
Rejects barren waste from valuable minerals at an early stage of the mining process
Offers a combination of ground-penetrating and other sensor technology that measure and report the grade of ore in real time
Integrates with material handling equipment such as shovels, scoops, belt conveyors, feeders and chutes
Facilitates decision support aimed at maximizing resource conversion and metal recovery

Our proprietary High Frequency Electromagnetic Spectrometry (HFEMS) and High Speed X-Ray Fluorescence (HSXRF) sensors not only offer better sensitivity, but more importantly, they operate at high speeds which support real-time processing at commercially relevant throughput for the mining industry.
To read more about how these and other sensor modalities interface with our proprietary real-time analytics platform to process sensor telemetry and make ore sorting decisions please go to our Products and Services pages.
