To make your shopping experience at Unique-Sports.com the easiest possible, when it says "free shipping", we have a single price - and that’s all you pay (unless you want it a bit faster...and we make that easy too!) Other stores may have similar prices, but once you add the hidden costs like extra shipping "options", handling, taxes and more, you’ll find that no sporting equipment shopping experience is quite like ours.
Orders on in stock merchandise that are received before 12:00pm Central Standard Time will be fulfilled within the same day.  Most orders will be delivered within 7 business days from the date of shipping.  Weekends and Holidays are excluded.  Most orders are shipped UPS Ground, which is free of charge. 
Free Shipping is a big part of what makes your shopping experience here UNIQUE!
                      If you have any questions about our Free Shipping policy, or if you need something shipped quicker (next day, two day, or 3 day), just call our Customer Care team at 1-800-297-0747 or email us at CustomerCare@Unique-Sports.com
