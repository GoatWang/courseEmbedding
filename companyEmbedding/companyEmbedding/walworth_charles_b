Surname meaning for "Walworth"
English: habitational name from either of two places called
Walworth, in Greater London and County Durham, both named with Old
English w(e)alh ‘Briton’, genitive plural wala (see
Wallace) + worð ‘enclosure’. The present-day
concentration of the name in Yorkshire suggests the latter is the more
likely source. Compare Wallwork.

He was born in that Township August 10, 1857, and is a son of Ole and Anna Storle, both natives of Norway, though they were married after coming to the United States, in Racine County, Wisconsin. The father was born in 1805 and lived to a ripe old age, passing away in 1891. It was in 1844 that he became a resident of this County and for a number of years was employed in the pine woods, making shingles. He was living in Norway Township when his first wife was accidentally shot by the discharge of a gun and he subsequently married the mother of our subject, who had also been previously married, her first husband being Mr. Engberson, by whom she had three children: Betsy, now the wife of Halber Knutson, of Minnesota; John, who is living with our subject and Ole Engberson, who is living retired in Blair, Wisconsin. There were two children born of the second marriage: Angeline, the wife of Frank Lapen, a farmer of Waterford, and Abraham. The parents were prominent members of the Lutheran church and Mr. Storle assisted in building the church of that denomination at Muskego. He was living... Read More  Biography of John PughWisconsin | 0  |      John Pugh, of Racine, who is filling the office of state game warden of Wisconsin, was born September 1, 1847, in the city in which he still makes his home. Almost three score years and ten have since come and gone and he has witnessed remarkable changes as the state has become thickly settled and the work of progress and improvement has been carried forward. His parents were James and Jeanette (Hughes) Pugh, both of whom were natives of Wales, but they were married in this County. The father on coming to the United States settled first in Utica, New York, afterward removing to Ohio and in 1842 arrived in Racine, where he resided until 1850. He then went to California, attracted by the discovery of gold on the Pacific coast, and for two years remained in that district, but in 1852 returned to Wisconsin. He died May 30, 1890, while his widow survived until 1892, and in their passing the County lost two of its representative and honored pioneer residents. John Pugh was educated in the common and high schools of Racine and was a youth of but seventeen years of age when, in 1864, he responded to the country’s call for aid, enlisting for one hundred days’ service. He was stationed on guard duty at Memphis and when his term of enlistment had expired he returned to... Read More     Biography of Frank L. MitchellWisconsin | 0  |      In taking up the personal history of Frank L. Mitchell it is unnecessary to tell to Racine and her people the place that he occupies, for his position has been established by the consensus of public opinion, and in considering his career one is led to the reflection that opportunities slip away from the sluggard, tauntingly play before the dreamer, but surrender to the individual with high purpose, undaunted courage and indefatigable determination. It is through the wise use of his opportunities that Frank L. Mitchell has reached the prominent position which he now fills. Born in Kenosha on... Read More  Biography of Judge Elbert Osborne HandNew York, Wisconsin | 0  |      Judge Elbert Osborne Hand, long a distinguished member of the Racine bar and for thirteen years occupying the bench of the County court, passed away June 19, 1915, an occasion which carried with it a sense of deep regret and sorrow to many who have been his associates and contemporaries. He was then nearing the eighty-fifth milestone on life’s journey and there came to him “the blessed accompaniments of age-honor, riches, and troops of friends.” Judge Hand was a native of New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York, born November 29, 1830, and came of English ancestry in both the maternal and paternal lines. His grandfathers were natives of New York, and John S. Hand, father of the judge, was born in New Lebanon, in 1804. He became a mechanic and was employed along that line until after his removal to the west, when he became connected with agricultural pursuits. Before leaving New Lebanon, however, he married Miss Emma J. Cowells, who was there born in 1810. She too was of English descent and her grandfather served in the War of 1812. It was in 1841 that John S. and Emma Hand arrived in Wisconsin, settling in Walworth County, where the father entered land and with ‘characteristic energy began the development of a farm. He lived a quiet and unassuming but useful life, never seeking to figure prominently in public... Read More  Biography of William Turnor LewisNew York, Wisconsin | 0  |      When death called William Tumor Lewis on the 30th of December, 1915, Racine lost one of its prominent pioneer manufacturers and capitalists, a man who was freely accorded honor and respect, not only because of the success which he had achieved, but also on account of the straightforward and commendable business principles which he always followed and the spirit of helpfulness which he manifested throughout his entire life. He never deviated from a course which he believed to be right in all of his relations with his fellowmen and his memory remains both as an inspiration and a benediction of those with whom he was associated. A native of New York, Mr. Lewis was born in Utica on the 10th of March, 1840, and received his early education in that city. In 1855, when a boy of fifteen, he became a resident of Racine and at an early age studied telegraphy under the guidance of his older brother, James F. Lewis, who afterward became chief justice of the supreme court of Nevada. At the outbreak of the Civil war Mr. Lewis was manager of the Racine office of the Western Union Telegraph Company and handled hundreds of messages relative to the great conflict. He soon enlisted in the Federal Military Telegraph Corps and was stationed at Cartersville, Georgia, at the headquarters of the Fifteenth Army Corps as military telegraph... Read More  Biography of Judge William Smieding, Jr.Ohio, Wisconsin | 0  |      Judge William Smieding, Jr., who for the past fifteen years has been the municipal and juvenile court judge of Racine County, is a native son of this city and his life record stands in contradistinction to the old adage that a prophet is not without honor save in his own country, for worth and ability have gained him professional recognition and he is regarded as one of the representative members of the Racine bar. He was born September 9, 1868, a son of William and Mary (Wustum) Smieding. The father’s birth occurred at Lübbecke, in western Prussia, November 11, 1831, and he was a son of August and Amelia (Mix) Smieding, who were likewise natives of that country, while his paternal grandfather was a brewer and baker of Germany, where he owned a small shop. He and his wife both died in Germany at an advanced age. Their son August followed in the footsteps of his father, acquainting himself with the trades of brewing and baking, but afterward went to Holland, where he secured a situation as clerk in a store. He was engaged in military duty under Napoleon I in the year 1815. His death occurred in 1850, when he was fifty-six years of age, while his wife passed away about six years before. Their family numbered seven children, including William Smieding, who obtained his education in the... Read More  Biography of W. A. CraneWisconsin | 0  |      W. A.

Read More  Biography of William Horlick, Jr.Illinois, Wisconsin | 0  |      It is too often true that successful business men seem to find no time for public affairs and lightly regard the duties and obligations of citizenship. A notable exception to this rule and one whose example is well worthy of emulation is that of William Horlick, Jr., who, while actively connected with the management and interests of the Horlick Malted Milk Company, has also found time and opportunity for co-operation in those plans and projects which have to do with the development and upbuilding of the community in which he lives.

Soon afterward he began his life work as an assistant of his father in the development of the business known the world over under the name of the Horlick Malted Milk Company. Resuming his studies he spent several terms as a student of applied science, division of engineering, at King’s College, London, England, during 1898, 1899 and 1900, thus splendidly equipping himself for the further conduct of most extensive and important business interests.

BiographyTerm: Mccanna, Charles B. 1851 - 1913Definition: businessman, cheese manufacturer, b. Jefferson County, N.Y. He moved to Wisconsin in 1876 and operated a cheese factory in Allengrove, Walworth County. He engaged in similar enterprises in southeastern Wisconsin until 1887, when he settled in Burlington; there he organized the McCanna Cheese and Butter Manufacturing Co., and operated about twenty factories in the area. In. 1893 the company was reorganized as McCanna and Fraser, with McCanna serving as president until his death. In 1898 he founded the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Co., which soon became one of the largest producers of condensed milk in Wisconsin and operated branch factories in Pecatonica and Grayslake, Ill. McCanna was president of this company from 1898 to 1913. McCanna was president of the Bank of Burlington (1906-1913). M. M. Quaife, Wis. (4 vols., Chicago, 1924); F. S. Stone, ed., Racine . . . and Racine Co. (2 vols., Chicago, 1916); Burlington Standard-Democrat, Dec. 19, 1913. Dairying and the industries which are allied thereto have ever constituted an important source of the wealth and prosperity of Racine County, and among the most enterprising and progressive business men of the district are those who have turned to that line of labor as a source of their business development. One of the well known, successful and highly respected representatives of the business in Racine County was Charles B. McCanna, who became an influential citizen of Burlington and one whose activities constituted not only a source of individual success but. also constituted one of the strong elements in the advancement of public prosperity. His life record covered the period from April 21, 1851, until December 11.. 1913. He was born and reared upon a farm in Jefferson County, New York, and, after mastering the branches of learning taught in the district schools, pursued a high school education and following his graduation engaged in teaching through five or six winters. The occupation to which he was reared, however, seemed to offer better opportunities and he took up the business of dairying and cheese making in Jefferson County, New York, conducting a cheese factory for two years. Attracted by the opportunities of the growing west, he came to Wisconsin in the spring of 1876 and after two months spent in Fond du Lac, removed to Allen Grove, Walworth County, where in partnership with T. P. Davis he purchased and operated a cheese factory. After two years he came to Racine County, settling in Rochester, and a year later removed to Springfield, Wisconsin, where he resided for several years. In 1887 he became identified with the interests of Burlington and there continued until his demise. Soon after his arrival he built and operated a large cheese factory and creamery, doing business under the name of the McCanna Cheese & Butter Manufacturing Company. He also became interested in a number of the leading factories of the surrounding country. In 1893 he joined R. C. Fraser, of Glasgow, Scotland. in forming the _McCanna & Fraser Company, and they took over the business which had formerly been conducted under the style of C. B. McCanna & Company. Their interests included eighteen or twenty creameries in Burlington and the surrounding country, which they operated very successfully, and they also purchased butter front several independent creameries, marketing their product in Philadelphia, where they maintained a large store. The excellence of their product insured a ready sale and the business grew to extensive and gratifying proportions. The utmost care was exercised as to the high quality of their product, and the business methods of the house, too, were such as conformed to the highest commercial standards. Mr. McCanna's partnership in that company constituted but one phase of his business activity, however, for in 1898, associated with R. O. Fraser and others, he organized the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company, one of the leading industries of the northwest, which developed a business of very extensive proportions and also established branch factories at Pecatonica and Grays Lake, Illinois, their business constantly developing until their output ranged from twelve to fifteen cars of condensed milk per week. Mr. McCanna was president of both the McCanna & Fraser Company and the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company, with his son, Charles Roy, as secretary. Something of the volume of their business is indicated in the fact that they employed from one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty people. Not only did they have the original plant established in Burlington but also built another in 1901-2. Mr. McCanna displayed marked executive ability in controlling his interests and at all times his course was characterized by an indefatigable energy that brought splendid results, making him one of the foremost business men of his section. In addition to his interests in connection with the creamery and cheese manufacturing business he became the president of the Burlington Land & Improvement Association; president of the Burlington Brass Works; president of the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Refrigerator Car Company; was one of the organizers of the Farmers & Merchants Bank at Pecatonica, Illinois, and served as president until his death; and likewise served as president of the Bank of Burlington from October 1, 1906, until his death. He erected the beautiful bank building at the corner of Pine and Chestnut streets, a building that is a great credit to Burlington and a lasting monument to his memory. All of these institutions profited by his co-operation, sound judgment and wise management. He was much interested in later life in the raising and breeding of pure-bred Holstein cattle and hogs and was the owner of the well known Edgewood Stock Farm at Burlington. In September, 1879, occurred the marriage of Mr. McCanna and Miss Pauline Cheeseman, native of this County and a daughter of Edward and Eliza (Johnson) Cheeseman, who came from England and settled in Racine County during the pioneer period in its development. Mr. and Mrs. McCanna had but one child, Charles Roy, who became the active and valued assistant of his father in business and is now president of the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company and also president of the McCanna & Fraser Company: Mr. McCanna was a communicant of the Catholic faith and to the church his family belongs. He was also identified with the Knights of Columbus but politically maintained an independent course, having preferred to exercise his right of franchise in support of the candidates whom he regarded as best qualified for office. He was also a member of the Chicago Athletic Club. He never sought political preferment but was officially connected with the schools as a member of the Burlington board of education and was active during the erection of the Burlington high school. He served as the first president of the board of the County Agricultural School at Rochester, was an untiring worker in securing its erection in this part of the County and served as a member of the board of trustees until his death. He was much interested in the Burlington Business Men's Association and especially in the younger members of the organization. In an unostentatious way he was a most liberal giver and the needy never appealed to hint in vain. His fellow townsmen spoke of him in terms of high regard, recognizing his ability and enterprise in business, his fidelity in citizenship and his loyalty to the ties of home and friendship. Wherever known. he was highly esteemed and most of all where he was best known, and his death, which occurred December 11. 1913, was the occasion of deep and widespread regret. Burlington could ill afford to lose a man like Mr. McCanna. He was foremost in all movements that tended to make a bigger and better city and his memory will ever be cherished by all who knew him.Source: Racine, Belle City of the lakes, and Racine County, Wisconsin : a record of settlement, organization, progress and achievement EMMYMCCAhttp://trees.ancestry.com/rd?f=image&guid=801672e1-bc0c-4c27-8bdb-45fddaf578fd&tid=22496627&pid=277

McCannaBiography of Charles B. McCannaUpdated: August 12, 2012 | Wisconsin | 0  |          Dairying and the industries which are allied thereto have ever constituted an important source of the wealth and prosperity of Racine County, and among the most enterprising and progressive business men of the district are those who have turned to that line of labor as a source of their business development. One of the well known, successful and highly respected representatives of the business in Racine County was Charles B. McCanna, who became an influential citizen of Burlington and one whose activities constituted not only a source of individual success but. also constituted one of the strong elements in the advancement of public prosperity.Discover your family's story.Enter a grandparent's name to get started.  choose a state: AnyALAKAZARCACOCTDEDCFLGAHIIDILINIAKSKYLAMEMDMAMIMNMSMOMTNENVNHNJNMNYNCNDOHOKORPARISCSDTNTXUTVTVAWAWVWIWYINTL  Start Now         His life record covered the period from April 21, 1851, until December 11.. 1913. He was born and reared upon a farm in Jefferson County, New York, and, after mastering the branches of learning taught in the district schools, pursued a high school education and following his graduation engaged in teaching through five or six winters. The occupation to which he was reared, however, seemed to offer better opportunities and he took up the business of dairying and cheese making in Jefferson County, New York, conducting a cheese factory for two years. Attracted by the opportunities of the growing west, he came to Wisconsin in the spring of 1876 and after two months spent in Fond du Lac, removed to Allen Grove, Walworth County, where in partnership with T. P. Davis he purchased and operated a cheese factory. After two years he came to Racine County, settling in Rochester, and a year later removed to Springfield, Wisconsin, where he resided for several years. In 1887 he became identified with the interests of Burlington and there continued until his demise. Soon after his arrival he built and operated a large cheese factory and creamery, doing business under the name of the McCanna Cheese & Butter Manufacturing Company. He also became interested in a number of the leading factories of the surrounding country. In 1893 he joined R. C. Fraser, of Glasgow, Scotland. in forming the _McCanna & Fraser Company, and they took over the business which had formerly been conducted under the style of C. B. McCanna & Company. Their interests included eighteen or twenty creameries in Burlington and the surrounding country, which they operated very successfully, and they also purchased butter front several independent creameries, marketing their product in Philadelphia, where they maintained a large store. The excellence of their product insured a ready sale and the business grew to extensive and gratifying proportions. The utmost care was exercised as to the high quality of their product, and the business methods of the house, too, were such as conformed to the highest commercial standards.Mr. McCanna’s partnership in that company constituted but one phase of his business activity, however, for in 1898, associated with R. O. Fraser and others, he organized the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company, one of the leading industries of the northwest, which developed a business of very extensive proportions and also established branch factories at Pecatonica and Grays Lake, Illinois, their business constantly developing until their output ranged from twelve to fifteen cars of condensed milk per week. Mr. McCanna was president of both the McCanna & Fraser Company and the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company, with his son, Charles Roy, as secretary. Something of the volume of their business is indicated in the fact that they employed from one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty people. Not only did they have the original plant established in Burlington but also built another in 1901-2. Mr. McCanna displayed marked executive ability in controlling his interests and at all times his course was characterized by an indefatigable energy that brought splendid results, making him one of the foremost business men of his section. In addition to his interests in connection with the creamery and cheese manufacturing business he became the president of the Burlington Land & Improvement Association; president of the Burlington Brass Works; president of the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Refrigerator Car Company; was one of the organizers of the Farmers & Merchants Bank at Pecatonica, Illinois, and served as president until his death; and likewise served as president of the Bank of Burlington from October 1, 1906, until his death. He erected the beautiful bank building at the corner of Pine and Chestnut streets, a building that is a great credit to Burlington and a lasting monument to his memory. All of these institutions profited by his co-operation, sound judgment and wise management. He was much interested in later life in the raising and breeding of pure-bred Holstein cattle and hogs and was the owner of the well known Edgewood Stock Farm at Burlington.In September, 1879, occurred the marriage of Mr. McCanna and Miss Pauline Cheeseman, native of this County and a daughter of Edward and Eliza (Johnson) Cheeseman, who came from England and settled in Racine County during the pioneer period in its development. Mr. and Mrs. McCanna had but one child, Charles Roy, who became the active and valued assistant of his father in business and is now president of the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company and also president of the McCanna & Fraser Company:Mr. McCanna was a communicant of the Catholic faith and to the church his family belongs. He was also identified with the Knights of Columbus but politically maintained an independent course, having preferred to exercise his right of franchise in support of the candidates whom he regarded as best qualified for office. He was also a member of the Chicago Athletic Club. He never sought political preferment but was officially connected with the schools as a member of the Burlington board of education and was active during the erection of the Burlington high school. He served as the first president of the board of the County Agricultural School at Rochester, was an untiring worker in securing its erection in this part of the County and served as a member of the board of trustees until his death. He was much interested in the Burlington Business Men’s Association and especially in the younger members of the organization. In an unostentatious way he was a most liberal giver and the needy never appealed to hint in vain. His fellow townsmen spoke of him in terms of high regard, recognizing his ability and enterprise in business, his fidelity in citizenship and his loyalty to the ties of home and friendship. Wherever known. he was highly esteemed and most of all where he was best known, and his death, which occurred December 11. 1913, was the occasion of deep and widespread regret. Burlington could ill afford to lose a man like Mr. McCanna. He was foremost in all movements that tended to make a bigger and better city and his memory will ever be cherished by all who knew him.
