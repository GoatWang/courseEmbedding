Company Overview

Watsco Inc. is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the HVAC/R distribution industry.  Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts and components for HVAC/R equipment and entered the distribution segment in 1989. The Company’s revenues in HVAC/R distribution have increased from $64.1 million in 1989 to $4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives. 
 
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050 employees serving 88,000 active customers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems. At December 31, 2016, the Company operated 565 locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.  Watsco is the only publicly-traded HVAC/R distributor. The Company’s Common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol WSO; the Company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSOB.
History
Watsco was founded in 1947 as a heating and cooling equipment and door and window parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tools. In 1963, Watsco became a publicly listed company, joined the American Stock Exchange in 1968 and later joined the NYSE in 1994.
Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Albert H. Nahmad, has been with Watsco since December 1972 when he acquired a controlling interest in the Company from its founder, William Wagner. From 1973 to 1988, Watsco grew from $5 million in revenues to $25 million as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. In 1989, the Company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. In 1990, Watsco acquired the California Rheem distributor Heating & Cooling Supply Inc., and within five years, purchased two other Rheem distributors, one in Texas and another in North Carolina.
By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco exited the manufacturing business in 1999 selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier).  In addition to divesting its manufacturing business in 1998, Watsco sold its staffing unit, Dunhill Staffing Systems, Inc., to ATS Group LLC in 2007 in order to focus solely on the distribution of HVAC/R products.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including Pameco (52 locations), East Coast Metal Distributors (27 locations), ACR Group, Inc. (54 locations) and several other smaller businesses.  In 2009, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier.
Residential HVAC Distribution Industry
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,100 distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications.  The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity.
The marketplace for HVAC/R products at the consumer level is estimated to be $88 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Central air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and is estimated to range from 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

                    WATSCO TO BUY AIR-CONDITIONING PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTOR                
Watsco Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Kaufman Supply for an undisclosed price to expand its distribution of air-conditioning and heating products into the growing manufactured-housing market. Watsco, with $635 million in 1997 revenue, is the largest United States distributor of air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment. Kaufman, based in Atlanta, distributes those products to owners of manufactured homes and had $102 million in revenue last year. Watsco, based in Miami, distributes its products in 22 states. Kaufman sells nationally to more than 2,500 contractors and dealers. Shares of Watsco slipped 43.75 cents yesterday, to $29.










COMPANY NEWS

                    WATSCO MAY SELL ITS MANUFACTURING AND STAFFING UNITS                
Watsco Inc. said yesterday that it was considering the sale of its manufacturing and temporary-staffing units to concentrate on its faster-growing business of distributing air-conditioning and heating products. The Miami-based company said the units, Watsco Components Inc. and Dunhill Staffing Systems Inc., are expected to account for less than 8 percent of 1998 revenue. Last year, Watsco Components had $23 million in revenue and Dunhill Staffing Systems, about $45 million. Watsco said it would also consider spinning off the units to shareholders. The move comes after a third-quarter earnings disappointment attributed to weakness in the manufacturing business. Watsco shares rose 93.75 cents yesterday, to $25.375.

Watsco Inc. agreed yesterday to purchase the Coastline Distribution Inc. unit and four factories owned by the Inter-City Products Corporation for less than $50 million in cash. Watsco, which makes residential central air- conditioners, will pay less than $50 million for Coastline, the Toronto-based unit that distributes heating and air-conditioning products, and four branches, Ronald Newman, Watsco's vice president for finance, said. He declined to give the exact price. The 1996 revenue for the businesses Watsco is acquiring is estimated to be $94 million, the company said.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

Watsco, Inc. is the largest[4] distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the United States. Watsco was founded more than 60 years ago as a manufacturer of parts, components and tools used in the HVAC/R industry. Under the leadership of its current CEO, Albert H. Nahmad, from 1973 to 1988 Watsco grew from US$5 million[5] in revenues to US$25 million. In 1989, the company shifted its focus from manufacturing to distribution by acquiring Gemaire Distributors Inc., a South Florida-based Rheem distributor. By 1997, Watsco added other OEMs to the mix and moved into commercial refrigeration as a result of the acquisition of Baker Distributing Company. Watsco divested its manufacturing business in 1998,[6] selling it to International Comfort Products Corporation, now part of Carrier Corporation (Carrier). Revenues increased from US$64.1 million in 1989 to US$4.2 billion in 2016 via a strategy of acquiring companies with established market position and subsequently building revenues and profit through a combination of adding locations, products, services and other initiatives.[7]
Watsco’s goal is to build a network of locations throughout North America that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC/R contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve homeowners and businesses. Watsco has approximately 5,050[8] employees assisting approximately 88,000[9] contractors and dealers who in turn, service, repair or replace HVAC/R systems in homes and businesses. At December 31, 2016, the company operated from 565 locations in 37 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.[10] Watsco is the only publicly traded HVAC/R distributor. The company’s Common stock is traded under the symbol WSO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[11] The company’s Class B common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WSO.B. Albert Nahmad, Chairman & CEO, controls the company with 53%[12] of the combined voting power.

Company history[edit]
Organization and development of the company[edit]
Watsco was organized in 1947 in New York, as a parts manufacturer originally known as Wagner Tool & Supply Corp. Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida on July 14, 1956 and went public in 1963. In 1968, Watsco was listed on the NYSE MKT LLC, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange. In 1969, Watsco merged with Sun Engineering and began its acquisition strategy.
A small player through the 1970s[edit]
After 1969, Watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations. Headquartered in Hialeah, Florida, an industrial area in greater Miami, the company operated principally in three industries in the 1970s: 1) the manufacture of climate control components for the heating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry; 2) the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry; and 3) the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry. In 1971, Watsco acquired Chicago-based Wabash Corp. and Kesco Products of New York. The company acquired Allin Manufacturing Company in 1973, a Chicago-based manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” (devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants).[13] In 1974, the company bought Mumma Tool & Die Company. In 1977, Watsco paid Clairol, Inc. approximately US$275,000[14] for its Sybil Ives Division, which included hair care products such as permanent waves, hair sprays, hair coloring, shampoos and conditioners. Watsco ran the Professional Hair Care division, consisting of Sybil Ives and Winslow Manufacturing, Inc., until 1982. In a profile on Watsco in Florida Trend magazine (October 1992),[15] the company’s sales and earnings throughout the 1970s were characterized as “unspectacular.” The company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era, with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different.
The company came under the control of a new leader in December 1972,[16] Albert H. Nahmad, when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder, William Wagner. He became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and eventually took the company in a new direction. Nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of New Mexico and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Administration from Purdue University. He then worked for several years for the conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co., and for the accounting firm Arthur Young & Co. (now known as Ernst & Young). For several years under Nahmad’s leadership at Watsco things did not look too different. The company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms, including Del Mar Engineering Co. in 1977, Rho Sigma, Inc. in 1979 and Cam-Stat, Inc. of Los Angeles in 1981.[17] The company sold its Professional Hair Care division in 1982 for US$540,000,[18] nearly twice what it had paid for the Clairol division five years earlier. In addition, Nahmad made several moves to strengthen Watsco’s operations. In 1982, Watsco’s Los Angeles-based subsidiaries Del Mar Engineering and Rho Sigma moved to Hialeah where they became part of the Production Enterprises division. In 1984, another California subsidiary, Cam-Stat, also moved to Hialeah so that Watsco’s operations were not so far-flung. The company also made a significant investment in 1982, buying an approximate 8.5% interest in Florida Commercial Banks, Inc., a bank holding company, for approximately US$3 million.[19] Two years later, Watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately US$8.6 million.[20]
Beginning to move in the 1980s[edit]
By the mid-1980s, Watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately US$14 million. Watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well. The U.S. Sun Belt had seen a boom in housing in the 1970s as many people migrated south, and Watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts. Air conditioners, used almost year-round in the Sun Belt, usually wore out within 8–10 years, so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the 1980s even as new home construction slowed. By 1986, Nahmad was anxious to expand Watsco, which had considerable cash to invest. Nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions, and even took out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him.[16] Then Watsco took an unexpected step. Its first major acquisition of the mid-1980s was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been. In May 1988, Watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called Dunhill Personnel System, Inc. Dunhill had revenue of roughly US$21 million annually, and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business. Nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years, but Dunhill continued to be a part of Watsco through 2007 when it was sold to ATS Group LLC.[21] In 1988, Watsco revenues reached US$22 million.[22]  
Entry into HVAC distribution[edit]
The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million.[23] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5%[24] interest in Heating & Cooling Supply, Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80%[25] of Heating & Cooling Supply, raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & Cooling Supply, paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest.[26] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.[27]
Steady growth in the 1990s[edit]
A long-term replacement cycle was underway in the Sun Belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the Sun Belt during the 1970s. Watsco also grew by expanding into new, high-growth markets. It opened a location in Las Vegas in 1991, anticipating vigorous population growth there. The company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. The hurricane devastated southern Florida in 1992 and in Miami-Dade County alone, about 26,000 homes were destroyed and more than 101,000 others were damaged.[28]
As Watsco’s distribution business took off, its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business. By 1993, about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution. Manufacturing was profitable and Watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls, which it sold to OEMs. Watsco also began making a new product in 1992, which it called the Flash. The Flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment. The Flash was manufactured by a Watsco subsidiary in Hialeah, and it was important because the Clean Air Act enacted in July 1992 prohibited the release of CFCs into the air. The Flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle CFCs in compliance with the law. With this new product, Watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade.
But it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994).[29] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier.[30] This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.
With the distribution business growing so quickly, Watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business. In January 1998, the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business, which generated approximately 90% of total revenues in 1997.[31] It sold its manufacturing subsidiary, Watsco Components, Inc., to International Comfort Products Corporation in 1998. Watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in 1998 buying a Georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry. Kaufman Supply, Inc. had annual revenues of US$102 million, and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the Southeast U.S.
By the late 1990s, Watsco had become a billion-dollar company. It had made significant inroads into the HVAC/R distribution market in Florida, Texas and California, key Sun Belt states. In 1999, the company announced that it was ready to move into New England, which was new territory for Watsco. New England was served by some 40 different distributors, and the total market for heating and cooling, including parts and supplies, was estimated to be worth more than US$400 million. In 1999, Watsco bought two major distributors in the Northeast, Homans Associates, Inc. and Heat, Inc., and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area. Watsco finished 1999 with 315[32] distribution locations in its network and record growth; revenues grew 17%, to US$1.25 billion.[33] Watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the U.S.
Improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the 2000s[edit]
In 2000, the company entered another mode, concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins.[34] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and replacement needs. Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion[35] in 2000, up slightly from the previous year. Revenues for 2001 shrank slightly yet Watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the HVAC/R distribution market. Company analysts perceived the HVAC/R distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented, suggesting there was still a place for a well-heeled consolidator.
Watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the 2000s acquiring a number of other businesses including 52 locations from a former competitor, Pameco, in 2003. It also acquired Goodman Manufacturing’s largest distributor, East Coast Metal Distributors, Inc., in 2005 with 27 locations in the Southeast. East Coast had been owned by the same family for more than 50 years.[36] Watsco then acquired Houston-based ACR Group, Inc. in 2007, a public company with 54 locations throughout the Sun Belt and annual revenues of approximately US$240 million.[37] Despite the economic slowdown that began in 2008, Watsco completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with Carrier in the second half of 2009.
Joint ventures with Carrier Corporation in the 2010s[edit]
In July 2009, Watsco formed a joint venture (Carrier Enterprise I) with Carrier to distribute Carrier products throughout the U.S. Sun Belt, Latin America and the Caribbean. Carrier contributed to Carrier Enterprise 95 locations in the U.S. Sunbelt and Puerto Rico and Carrier’s export division located in Miami, Florida, and Watsco contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. Watsco purchased a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture for US$181 million with options to purchase up to an additional 20% interest from Carrier (10% beginning in July 2012 and an additional 10% in July 2014).
This represented a transformational event in Watsco’s history. The transaction doubled Watsco’s already market-leading position and expanded its product lines and brands. The company was also able to expand its presence in the U.S. Sun Belt, where its products are of critical importance. In particular, Carrier Enterprise added product depth to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.”[38]
Effective July 2, 2012,[39] Watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the company’s ownership interest to 70%. On July 1, 2014, Watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 80%. In April 2011,[40] Watsco formed a second joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise II, to distribute Carrier products throughout the Northeast U.S. in largely new markets for the company. In July 2011,[41] the company added Carrier’s distribution operations in Mexico to the second joint venture. In November 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%. In April 2012,[42] Watsco formed a third joint venture, Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, an affiliate of Carrier, to distribute Carrier products from 35 locations throughout all of the provinces and territories in Canada. Watsco has a 60% controlling interest in this joint venture and UTC Canada has a 40% noncontrolling interest.
The three Carrier Enterprise joint ventures employ approximately 2,500 individuals and operate from more than 200 locations in 27 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with exports to more than 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 61% [43] of Watsco’s revenues for 2016.

Residential HVAC distribution industry[edit]
The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300[45] distribution companies. The industry in the U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (Goodman), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd., Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), Trane Inc., a subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand Company Limited, York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc., Lennox International, Inc. and Nordyne Corporation (Nordyne), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users.
Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market, the commercial market and residential new construction market. The replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million[46] central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable replacement market.
Business strategy[edit]
Watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. Watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies. Newly acquired businesses have access to Watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service.
Strategy in existing markets[edit]
Watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. The company responds to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. The company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, Watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factory-operated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as Watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do, which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market.
In addition to the replacement market, Watsco sells to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. The company believes its reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow them to compete effectively in these markets.
Acquisition strategy[edit]
The company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, Watsco has acquired 59[47] HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. Watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets.
Operating philosophy[edit]
Acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, Watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brand-name offerings.[16] Watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies.
Watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies.
Products[edit]
Watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products the company distributes consist of: (i) equipment, including residential central air conditioners ranging from 1-1/2 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. The refrigeration products Watsco distributes include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications.
Distribution and sales[edit]
The largest market Watsco serves is the U.S., in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt. Accordingly, the majority of Watsco’s distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency. In the U.S., cooling and heating accounts for approximately half[48] of the energy consumed in a typical home.
Key suppliers[edit]
Watsco has significant relationships with Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Nordyne, Emerson, Manitowoc, Honeywell, Owens Corning, Johns Manville and DuPont, each of which is a leading manufacturer of HVAC/R products in the U.S. Each manufacturer has a well-established reputation of producing high-quality, competitively priced products. The manufacturers’ current product offerings, quality, serviceability and brand-name recognition allows Watsco to operate favorably relative to their competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the manufacturers of air conditioning and heating equipment provide national advertising and participate with Watsco in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
