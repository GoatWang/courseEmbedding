Wolverine Asset Management Settles with Securities and Exchange Commission Over TVIX Info Sharing
Oct 9 15
Wolverine Asset Management agreed to pay $1 million to settle the charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the securities regulator, each of the firms agreed to pay penalties of $375,000, disgorgement of $364,145.80 and prejudgment interest of $39,158.47. SEC allegations against Wolverine affiliates Based on the SEC's order instituting administrative proceedings, Wolverine Trading, and Wolverine Asset Management failed to maintain and enforce policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of nonpublic information. The Commission found that both firms violated their policies and procedures by sharing information repeatedly in February to March 2012. Wolverine Trading and Wolverine Asset Management shared their trading positions and strategies for the TVIX, an exchange-traded note that traded at a premium to its indicative value after new issuances of the note were suspended temporarily. According to the SEC, the firms' traders met and discussed issues regarding TVIX despite information barriers between the affiliates. Additionally, they discussed details surrounding the potential re-openings of the new issuances of TVIX. On March 22, 2012, the price of TVIX noted declined prior to the issuer's announcement regarding the reopening of issuances of the note, as ValueWalk reported at the time. The Commission noted that Wolverine Asset Management made profits that it should not have received from that market opportunity. The SEC emphasized that the policies and procedures of the broker-dealer and investment adviser have deficiencies including vague provisions, inadequate guidance, and monitoring or surveillance of potential sharing of information. Wolverine Trading and Wolverine Asset Management agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any similar violations in the future and to be censured without admitting or denying the findings of the Commission.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Because our technology drives the market, the engineering team is very involved with the business and shares ownership over the work that is being produced.  At Wolverine we believe in our engineers and trust them to find the best solution. They are encouraged to investigate new technologies and challenge the status quo. With an open and collaborative environment you can get immediate feedback and see the results of your work in action.













































Wolverine Trading | Our People



































OUR PEOPLE
Wolverine's greatest asset.







Open Positions
Internships








No suits required.
It's not about the clothes... it's about the person in them. At Wolverine, we've created a strong, collaborative environment with exceptional growth opportunities.  Whether your interest is trading, technology, or operations, motivated and innovative individuals can find many pathways to success.  Our flat organizational structure promotes teamwork across the Firm and offers easy access to senior staff (don't worry, they won't be wearing a suit either).











Achieving more by working together.
While we work exceptionally well as a team in the office, our bonds are further strengthened through company events and activities. Volleyball, soccer, hockey, 5K runs, picnic, parties, and trivia nights provide friendly competition and build better relationships. By getting out of our  usual environment and doing out-of-the-ordinary things together, we foster creativity and broaden our imaginations to accomplish new challenges.
