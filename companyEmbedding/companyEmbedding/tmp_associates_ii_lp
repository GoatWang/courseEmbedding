TMP is a firm of over 125 highly qualified professionals in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and Interior Design.  The firm was founded in 1959 to meet the burgeoning need for elementary and secondary schools which was created by the baby boom following World War II.  TMP was, and continues to be, a leader in the design of educational facilities.  Today our practice encompasses virtually all components of the modern day classroom, from preschools to college and university settings.  
Through the years, as a natural outgrowth of our work for education clients, TMP has developed nationally recognized expertise in the design of recreation centers, performing and fine arts facilities, and libraries.  These challenging building types, in addition to our K-12 and college facilities, have been the primary focus of our practice.  Over 400 national, regional and state level awards for design excellence attest to our ability regarding innovative design within budget and schedule.  
While our practice is concentrated in the Midwest, TMP has executed work from California to Pennsylvania, Ontario to Louisiana.  
We are dedicated to providing responsible, personal service to our clients, and take pride in the many outstanding projects we share with them.

Nr.: LPS130Medium:LPGewicht:340 gLand:HollandBearbeitungszeit:1 TagO.P.M.C. (Oldest Professional Music Company, as they were living in the famous Amsterdam Red Light District in those days) centered around Barrie Webb and Teun van der Slikke with different line ups during their existence. Other musicians in their recordings feature Frank van Tijn (drums), Peter van der Sande (bass, cello, elctric guitar, keyboards - plus he also did arrangements and production) and Onny Lopulalan (lead guitar), some of them having served in other interesting Dutch bands such as Apartment 1 or Serpentine. Even ex-Outsiders' legends Leendert Busch and Appie Rammers were at once among the O.P.M.C. line up!

On their second LP, 'Product Of Pisces And Capricorn' from 1971, their sound has reached higher labels of sofistication, mixing the popsike path with 70's rockier stuff.


'These two young men could have had the music world at their feet. If you listen the songs on this OPMC album, it will become apparent to you that they both loved the Beatles, yet they still managed to make their own style of music with “A little help from their friends” • Robbie Dale Robinson (Admiral MBF. Retired)

Originally released in Pink Elephant in 1971, the Wah Wah reissue will come housed in a quality glossy laminated gatefold sleeve reproducing the original artwork, remastered sound, and featuring an insert with photos and liner notes. Limited edition of only 500 copies.Alle Preise inkl. gesetzl. MwSt., ggfs. zzgl. Versandkosten
