Chris and Harris Pappas
				The restaurant business proved a successful enterprise indeed for Jim Pappas and his father H.D. who came to America from Greece in 1897. But when the next generation came along, young Chris and Harris were encouraged to avoid the restaurant industry and given warnings about its long hours and unpredictable schedules. The brothers managed to stay away – for a little while. Harris earned a finance degree from Texas A&M University and served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. Chris received a degree in engineering from the University of Texas and took a job at IBM computers. But the lure of the restaurant biz proved too strong for both brothers. Soon, Harris found himself managing his father Jim's first restaurant, the Dot Coffee Shop, only to be followed shortly by Chris who stepped in at his brother's request. 
				
By 1976, the brothers opened their first restaurant together, The Strawberry Patch, and they have been delighting restaurant-goers ever since.  The Pappas brothers now own and operate nearly 100 restaurants in seven states. Their nine brands offer something for everyone, from fresh gulf coast seafood to Cajun-inspired cuisine, award-winning steaks, and the best Tex-Mex on planet Texas.
				
In addition to being restaurant pioneers, the Pappas Brothers are quite involved in their local community. Chris and Harris give generously of their time to the Boy Scouts of America, Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, the Boys and Girls Club and many more community associations. In short, the Pappas Brothers are just your everyday exceptional entrepreneurs of Greek descent who have made quite a name for themselves in the restaurant business or, as Harris likes to say, the "people business." Basically, they're just glad you like their food. Yes, you. And, as long as you keep liking it, they'll keep making it.

			



				The Pappas Brothers opened their first restaurant in 1976 and set out to serve only the highest quality food, fulfill their Guest's every request and make sure everyone who walked in the door felt like family. Since then, we've opened more than 100 restaurants and have become a leader in the hospitality industry. But at Pappas, it's still all about great food, impeccable service and the people who make it happen. From the truck driver who delivers only the freshest meats and seafood, to the hostess greeting Guests with a smile, to the server setting down a custom-made entrée with care, everyone at Pappas plays a role in our success. 
				
				We're a family owned and operated company, which means our core values have been passed down from generation to generation. We're constantly focused on innovation, attention to detail and quality in everything we do. Over the years, our steadfast values and top-notch team have kept prospective employees seeking us out and satisfied Guests coming back. 
			

Pappas Spirit

				The Spirit of the Pappas restaurants is embodied in our Mission Statement. It's what makes our company unique, attracts new employees and Guests and motivates our regulars to return again and again.
				

Our Goal

				To be a superior restaurant company through constant innovation, attention to detail and a focus on quality in all we do.
				

Our Guests

				We are dedicated to greeting each person who walks through our doors with warmth and friendliness. We create an outstanding dining experience through identifying and fulfilling Guest expectations.
				

Our Team

				We believe that the greatest strength of Pappas restaurants lies within our people. We are committed to providing an exciting environment that recognizes initiative and performance. We offer opportunities for growth and challenge individuals to achieve their best.
				

Our Communities

				We build relationships through participation and service and work together
				to help meet the needs of the community.
			

What's Pappas up to in your community?
Want to work with Pappas?



Our Family is Bigger than You Think

				One of the things that makes Pappas restaurants different is that we do more than simply run and operate our restaurants. We own and drive the trucks that deliver the freshest meats and seafood. We employ the electricians who keep the lights on and the kitchens humming. We even make our own chairs! 
				
				We own and operate almost everything we need to ensure we continue to serve the highest quality food in the exciting, comfortable environment that keeps our Guests satisfied and coming back. This type of business is called "vertical integration," and it helps us ensure there's never a holdup in the process and that we have the absolute best for our Guests the moment they ask for it.

Co-founder of Pappas Restaurants dies
1919 PETE HARRIS PAPPAS 2005A leader in Houston's restaurant scene


By Nicki Britton


        Published 6:30 am, Wednesday, December 21, 2005
    



































































Pete Harris Pappas took risks.
From building a restaurant dynasty to mentoring entrepreneurs and piloting small aircraft, "Mr. Pete," as colleagues and employees called him, was a leader with wide-reaching impact on the Houston hospitality industry.
The co-founder of Pappas Restaurants, a privately held chain of about 80 eateries, including Pappasito's Cantina, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen and Pappas Bros. Steakhouse, died Sunday of natural causes at age 86.
Pappas was a leader in the Houston hospitality community for almost 60 years.
"He was very in tune with the restaurant scene," said George Christie, vice president of Christie's Steak and Seafood House and president of the Greater Houston Restaurant Association. "He had the pulse of the business under his thumb."
Pappas Restaurants, in tune with the Texas love of big food, are famous for serving diners with generous portions at affordable prices.

"(They) put 25 percent more food on your plate. That is their advertising. I have friends who go to Pappas restaurants because they know there is sure to be some food left over that they can take home," Dick Huiras, former president of a restaurant consultant group, told the Chronicle in a previous interview.
Dimitrios Fetokakis, owner of Niko Niko's Greek restaurant, considered Pappas a mentor. "Any time I called Mr. Pete, even when I was a kid, he would pick up the phone and listen."
When Fetokakis's parents opened a restaurant in the mid-1970s, he said, Pappas — a stranger — met with them and agreed to give them some equipment.
"You ask yourself, would you give help to someone you don't know?" said Fetokakis. His parents later repaid Pappas.
"(Pete) comes from a time when character counted," said nephew Chris J. Pappas, who runs Pappas Restaurants with his brother Harris.
"He could read a man's character and know that he was going to put his best efforts in."
Houston was boomtown

Pappas was born in Dallas in 1919, and moved to Houston in 1946 with his three brothers. Their father, a Greek immigrant who owned restaurants in Texas, Arkansas and Tennessee, had alerted them to a business opportunity in Houston distributing refrigeration equipment.

"Houston was an up-and-coming market," said Chris Pappas. "They saw it as a boomtown in the '40s. It was a very open town, an accepting town to people moving here, a wildcat town."
The brothers founded Pappas Refrigeration. Pete Pappas patented several pieces of equipment, including a commercial ice machine still used in the seafood industry.
According to Chris Pappas, the brothers' entrepreneurship led to their success. According to a family friend, he said, the brothers figured out the secret to selling refrigeration equipment: "Follow the ice truck around."
In 1967, Pappas and his brother, Jim, left the equipment business and opened Dot Coffee Shop, followed shortly by the Brisket House, now Pappas Bar-B-Q. Jim Pappas' sons, Chris, Harris and Gregory J. Pappas, now deceased, later joined the business. The family went on to open the Strawberry Patch (later reconceived as Pappas Bros. Steakhouse), Pappas Seafood, Pappasito's, Pappadeaux and Yia Yia Mary's.
Served in Army Air Corps

Pappas stepped down as head of the family company several years ago, but remained active. He was essential to the siting of new restaurants, said Chris Pappas. Until just a few weeks ago, he continued to come to the Pappas Restaurants office on Yale Street.

Pappas served in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
"He served ... with the inspector general's corps," said his nephew. "He would inspect crash accidents."
The job did not deter the recreational pilot, who enjoyed flying small planes to remote hunting areas.
Pappas is remembered by some members of the restaurant community as a quiet but fun-loving leader.
Alex Brennan-Martin, whose family owns Brennan's of Houston and Commander's Palace in New Orleans, described Pappas' contributions to the local restaurant scene as "incalculable.
"People say to me, 'Oh, you're part of the Brennan family,' and I chuckle," he said. "What we've done is minuscule compared to the Pappas (family). I admire them like I admire almost no one else."
Pappas is survived by Helen Lucas Pappas, his wife of 48 years, daughters Pamela Mattingly and Mersina Stubbs, and five grandchildren.
Services will be held at 10:30 a.m. today at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral, 3511 Yoakum Blvd. In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorials be directed to The Star of Hope and The Ronald McDonald House.

As Pappas Restaurants, Inc. began to expand throughout Houston, Greg moved into the design and construction of the company's restaurants, including Pappas Seafood House, Pappasito's Cantina, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen and the Dot Coffee Shop.
He worked as a general contractor, managing the structural, architectural, mechanical, and interior design of new restaurants, as well as service and remodeling work on existing locations. Today, design, construction and service work is done almost entirely by in-house employees, a direct result of Greg's influence.
Greg graduated from Texas A&M University with a bachelor's degree in industrial distribution. After graduation, he was certified in refrigeration and air conditioning by Durham Technical College. Greg lived in Houston, where he was a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. He enjoyed skiing, golfing, attending sports events and was an exotic car enthusiast. He always valued time spent with his extended family.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity. Fidelity does not endorse or adopt their content.

A new generation takes the reins at Pappas Restaurants

1 / 6


Back to Gallery









 

There are few more recognizable names in Houston than the Pappas family. We've all eaten at one of their restaurants: Pappas Bar-B-Q for smoked meats, Pappadeaux for seafood, and Pappasito's for Tex-Mex just to name a few.
The Pappas empire has grown from two restaurants in downtown Houston in 1967 to more than 85 restaurants in eight states today.
Few Houstonians know the story behind the family that has expanded Pappas Restaurants into one of the country's largest family-owned restaurant chains. It starts in 1897, when H.D. Pappas immigrated to America from Greece. He settled in Dallas and raised four sons - Jim, Pete, Tom and George. The sons moved to Houston in the 1940s to start a successful refrigeration business - a growth industry at the time to say the least.





In addition to refrigeration equipment, the brothers started selling other equipment to local restaurants. They slowly started to get into the restaurant business themselves.
By the 1960s they were concentrating on two of their restaurants in downtown Houston, both on Pierce Street: The Dot Coffee Shop (where the Metro station is now), and the Brisket House (where a Pappas Bar-B-Q still is).

Around that time, Jim's sons returned to Houston - Harris from the Army and Chris from college. Though the family business was successful, the two wanted to strike out on their own. Harris took a job at the Luby's Cafeteria chain. Chris sold bibles door-to-door and later took a job at a Denny's restaurant. 
It was during this time that Harris and Chris learned every aspect of the restaurant business from dish washing to cooking to serving and management. In 1967, they took over day-to-day management of the family restaurants and laid the foundation for the business it is today. Greg Pappas, another brother involved in the family business, died in a car accident in 1995.
Harris and Chris still are directly involved in day-to-day operation of Pappas Restaurants, but, over the past few years, their children have taken on more prominent roles. 
"They live in a world where nothing is ever good enough, nothing is ever completed," says Christina Pappas, referring to standards set by her father, Harris, and uncle, Chris. Like a lot of heirs to Texas food empires, the sense of responsibility (and pressure) to continue the success of the family business is palpable. But the new generation of Pappas family restaurateurs seems to take it in stride.
Six Pappas children, all in their 20s and 30s, are involved in day-to-day operations. Christina handles marketing and guest relations while her sister Mary handles restaurant operations. Another sister, Evy, is an architect and oversees restaurant construction. Brother H.D. manages real estate interests and younger brother Tom just joined the business and is working at their newest concept, Pappas Meat Co. Chris' daughter Georgea heads up culinary research and development.
Mary literally grew up in the family business - at the time her dad and uncle took over the downtown restaurants, they were living in the 2016 Main apartment tower across the street. "My dad told all the employees he lived there so he could watch them all the time," Mary said.
After college, Mary started as a manager at a Pappadeaux location. Not long after that, Pappas acquired the Luther's Bar-B-Q chain and Mary oversaw its merger with Pappas. Although her background is in barbecue, Mary now oversees business operations for all Pappas restaurants.
Mary is quick to point out that Pappas still is a family-owned business; investors and shareholders aren't a factor in decision making. That's critical in the cyclical nature of the restaurant business. Whereas some chains will lay off employees and switch to lower quality ingredients to keep profits up during tough times, Pappas has the resources and the independence to ride out the slumps.
Many employees work for Pappas their whole lives, and two of the original employees hired by Chris and Harris Pappas still are involved with the company. Though there is a fast-track program for college graduates to become managers, almost all of their restaurant managers started as servers or cooks and all managers are promoted from within the company.
It all makes for consistency in management in a large restaurant chain. 
The new generation of the Pappas family is fully aware of the vagaries of the restaurant business, and the brutal competition they are sure to encounter in the future. 
"We like competition," Christina said. "It keeps us on our toes."

History[edit]




Pappas Bar-B-Q, 1217 Pierce Street, Downtown Houston


The family-owned Pappas Restaurants, Inc., chain operates in more than 80 locations in Houston, Birmingham, Dallas, Cincinnati, Austin, San Antonio, Beaumont, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Albuquerque, and Phoenix. The restaurants encompass a variety of concepts, including Pappas Bros. Steakhouse, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, Pappas Seafood House, Pappasito's Cantina, Pappas Bar-B-Q, Pappas Burger, and Yia Yia Marys. The company is run by brothers Christopher and Harris Pappas, who also serve as the executive team at Luby's, Inc., a cafeteria chain in several states.
The origins of the family-operated Pappas Restaurants dates back several generations, beginning with H.D. Pappas, who emigrated from Greece in 1897 and opened restaurants in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Texas. In 1945, H.D. Pappas's sons, Pete and Jim, moved to Houston where they obtained a franchise to sell beer coolers in South Texas. The brothers eventually built the venture into a successful restaurant supply business, selling chairs, booths, refrigerators, and other kitchen equipment. The business was cyclical, however, and the brothers soon decided to try the restaurant field in 1967 with the opening of Dot Coffee Shop off of I-45 South just inside the 610 loop of Houston. In 1970, Jim Pappas's son Harris joined the family business, soon followed by his other sons, Christopher and Greg.




The Dot Coffee Shop in Houston, opened in 1967, was the first restaurant venture by the second generation of the Pappas family.


After Jim Pappas's death in 1982, his sons aggressively expanded the business, opening more seafood restaurants, as well as profitable Mexican and Cajun restaurants. The Pappas brothers grew the business on a tireless attention to detail, value, and service. They also made their mark by offering large portions at moderate prices at restaurants with highly visible locations. What the restaurants tended to lose in higher food costs, they made up for with volume and considerable customer turnover. The company had a competitive edge on publicly owned restaurant chains, which were under pressure to build new units in a hurry and to improve their bottom lines from one quarter to the next. Unlike these competitors, the Pappas business could take its time in building a high quality restaurant, devoting as much labor to the project as was required.
In 1989, after concentrating their business in Houston with more than 25 Pappas dining spots, the family began expanding into Dallas and Austin. In 1992, the business broke into the San Antonio market with one of its Pappasito's Cantina Mexican food eateries. The company planned to open another Pappasito's and the Pappas' Cajun seafood concept, Pappadeux Seafood Kitchen, in San Antonio by the fall of 1993. Each of these restaurants included 10,000 to 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) of space, was designed by the Pappas' architectural staff, and was built by the company's in-house construction crew.
The company was shaken when Greg Pappas died in a car accident on a Houston highway.[4] With his death in February 1995, the company lost an important member of its executive team as well as its main architect.
In 1996, the company's gamble on a new concept - an upscale steakhouse with a cigar room, impressive wine cellar, and playful art -raised the business to new heights. The company opened its first Pappas Bros. Steakhouse on the spot of the Strawberry Patch American bistro, an eatery they had opened in 1976 and closed in 1993. The steakhouse represented a departure from the company's other causal dining restaurants and poised it for future growth. Another Pappas Steakhouse was opened in 1998, located in the restaurant row that had developed along Northwest Highway in Dallas. The company took more than a year to build this restaurant. With a wine list of 1,600 selections, a cigar room, and other amenities, the restaurant proved a success in catering to business executives and those with a taste for fine food. At the same time, the company continued to expand its family empire with the opening of new restaurants in Chicago and Atlanta.

The company opened its first Pappas Bros. Steakhouse on the spot of the Strawberry Patch American bistro, an eatery they had opened in 1976 and closed in 1993. The steakhouse represented a departure from the company's other causal dining restaurants and poised it for future growth. Another Pappas Steakhouse was opened in 1998, located in the restaurant row that had developed along Northwest Highway in Dallas. The company took more than a year to build this restaurant. With a wine list of 1,600 selections, a cigar room, and other amenities, the restaurant proved a success in catering to business executives and those with a taste for fine food. At the same time, the company continued to expand its family empire with the opening of new restaurants in Chicago and Atlanta.
