Review By Nathanial

I ordered one of these for my son (he’s 3) to start his own collection. It came in as advertised. I’m very pleased with my order and will be ordering again soon!

Review By Peter

In a 5-Coin order, all coins I received were from the most common date of this series, 1922.
Grades of the coins surpassed the VG rating promised. In this order were:
2 – F
3- VF
Overall I am very much pleased with my order, as the coins were better than advertised. I would wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone looking for nicer-looking common-date Peace Dollars at a reasonable price.


 Peter from WI– February 3, 2015

Product Description
The Peace Silver Dollar would experience one of the briefest, but most unconventional mintage periods in the history of US currency. It was produced by the United States Mint from 1921 to 1928 and then for another 2 years from 1934 to 1935 due to changes in legislation. Because both of its mintage periods preceded the 1965 cessation of silver currency, the Peace Silver Dollar would be the last genuine “silver” dollar to ever be produced. Consequently, it remains a popular favorite among collectors since it is one of the few existing pieces of silver currency left.
Coin Highlights:

Contains .7734 oz of .900 fine silver.
Minted by the United States Mint between 1922 and 1926 or 1934 and 1935.
Features the famous Peace Dollar design created by Anthony di Francisci.

All peace dollars featured in this collection are in very good circulated condition, which means that they have maintained an above average appearance despite visible wear. Each individual coin was minted from .77344 troy oz of 90% pure silver. It measures 38.1 mm in diameter.
The artwork for the Peace Silver Dollar was the result of a contest, in which participants were asked to create the new dollar coin design. The winning entry came from artist, Anthony di Francisci. His design displayed a unique rendition of Lady Liberty that was based on the real life Statue of Liberty. Francisci’s Liberty is depicted on the front of the coin wearing a “radiate” or multiple pointed crown with several loose strands of hair gently blowing in the wind. Beneath her appear the words “In God We Trust.” Also inscribed in a circular border along the coin’s edge are her name and the coin’s mintage year.
Prominently displayed on the reverse side of the dollar coin is another beloved American icon, the bald eagle. The eagle perches nobly upon a mountain top with an olive branch clasped in its talons. Emanating behind our national bird are rays of sunlight, whose pointed shape is reminiscent of Lady Liberty’s crown. Appearing above the eagle as an arched heading are our nation’s name and the words “E Pluribus Unum.”
With its rich history and its patriotic design motif, this charming piece of Americana is certain to enhance any collection. If you would like to learn more about this Peace Silver Dollar, please contact us at 800-276-6508. Our staff is also happy to assist you via live chat or online forms.

Video About Security Federal Bank 
 Video Transcript: Security Federal Bank was founded in 1922 in picturesque Aiken, South Carolina. In 1987, we formed a holding company, Security Federal Corporation, which trades on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol SFDL.OB. We have branches located throughout Aiken, Lexington and Richland Counties (Metro Columbia), South Carolina and a branch in Columbia County (Metro Augusta), Georgia. We have three branches that are Open 7 Days a Week.
Security Federal Bank is committed to providing the highest level of financial services in a trustworthy, courteous and professional manner, treating all of our customers equitably and fairly.  In fact, we have a long tradition of focusing on the customers we serve. Our central theme is “Do what’s in the best interest of the customer.” This slogan reverberates throughout the entire organization and is spoken frequently by our Chairman of the Board.

Banking Services
Security Federal offers a full line of personal and commercial products including online and mobile banking, online bill payment, and a broad array of commercial, consumer and mortgage loan products. We are also proud of our Looney Tunes Savings Club for youngsters and our Financial Counseling Department, both of which provide innovative products and approaches that enhance financial education and help people become good stewards of their fiscal resources.  We believe in investing in our community. That’s one reason the U.S. Treasury awarded us national recognition and certification as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in September 2010.

Trust and Investments*
We want to help our customers reach their financial goals.  That’s why we offer financial management services through two divisions: Security Federal Investments* and Security Federal Trust*.  Our Trust division provides services that assist you in managing personal investments, paying bills for loved ones, or carrying out an estate plan, while the Investment division offers a full menu of financial products including mutual funds, annuities, and various retirement accounts.

Insurance Products*
Security Federal Insurance offers an extensive line of insurance* products, including business, personal, auto and homeowners to protect your personal and business assets.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
