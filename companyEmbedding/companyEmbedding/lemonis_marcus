THE 3Ps - People, Process & Product

       			 	Lemonis judges businesses with THE 3 Ps Principle - (P)eople-(P)rocess-(P)roduct. He recognizes that the most important “P” is people, and that the right people are effective while the wrong people are destructive.  The second “P” looks at how organizations create, deliver, and sell the process. Finally, the third “P” determines whether the product is an excellent one and a relevant one.
 
              He stresses that for a business to be successful, it has to have at least 2 of THE 3Ps working in its favor. 
 
					Out of the three, he mentions that People are the most important.

    ABOUT MARCUS
  


entrepreneur [ahn-truh-pruh-nur, -noo r] noun; 1. A person who organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable initiative and risk.


As an impressionable youth, Marcus Lemonis read the description of Entrepreneur to his mother from the dictionary while working on a school project, which inspired him to challenge himself and make his dreams come true. His humble beginnings and journey through life represent the heart and soul of what true entrepreneurism is. Although he was not born in America, he is proud to be living the American Dream through hard work, determination and believing; striving to take risks and show initiative while motivating people to do their best not by telling them what to do, but rather by showing them how to do it. Those who have had the chance to hear his story through his moving speaking engagements would say that he is humble, down to earth and 100 percent brutally honest.
    On CNBC’s reality series, The Profit, which returns for its fifth season in 2017, Marcus lends his business expertise to struggling businesses in various industries across the country while using his famous people-process-product principle. Through his 3P mantra, he analyzes every business by the quality people, whether they have an excellent and relevant product, and the best possible process for creating, delivering, and selling that product. Over 4 seasons of The Profit have aired since July of 2013 and more than $40 million dollars of his own money has been invested into helping these small businesses, and after experiencing tremendous success, his mission continues. While many people frequently call him the “business turnaround king,” he will be the first to say that he really helps people with tough love so they can use the experience to inevitably succeed. His new show, The Partner, will also premiere in 2017, in which candidates from diverse business backgrounds will compete for the opportunity of a lifetime - a position working alongside Lemonis and an equity stake in a multi-million-dollar company.
    Marcus was born in war-torn Beirut, Lebanon in 1973; and, at nine months old, was adopted by a Lebanese and Greek couple living in Miami, FL. As a young child, he was exposed to positive and prosperous business values at his family-owned business, Anthony Abraham Chevrolet. His entrepreneurial spirit bloomed at age 12 while attending Epiphany Catholic School, when he started a lawn mowing service in order to generate money to open a candy business while enlisting his friends for their help. He then graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in Miami and moved to Milwaukee, WI to attend Marquette University, where he studied Political Science, Criminology and Economics.
    He returned to Florida after graduation and ran for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives. At age 22, with no political experience, he gained the endorsement of the Miami Herald. Though he lost the campaign, Marcus refocused and held several automotive sales and managerial roles. It was a conversation with family friend and former Chrysler CEO, Lee Iacocca, who advised him to get into the camping and RV business, which put him on the path to eventual chairmanship at America’s #1 source for RVs, camping accessories, RV maintenance and repair, Camping World and Good Sam.
    Lemonis was recognized for having “more impact on the industry than any single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation,” when RV Business Magazine named him their 2007 Newsmaker of the Year. In addition, Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of “40 under 40,” and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him Entrepreneur of the Year. Prior to The Profit, he appeared on NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice in 2011 and 2012, and was also featured on ABC’s television show Secret Millionaire in 2012.
    Marcus is truly passionate about people. His philanthropy started in college, where he served as the president of Marquette’s Student Athletic Committee and planned a citywide clothing drive to help the homeless of Milwaukee. Over the years, he has also contributed time and money to various organizations near and dear to his heart.
    He receives hundreds of emails on a daily basis from people seeking business advice and investments, but as you may have seen on The Profit, he is not a bank, consultant or the fairy godmother. Marcus spends time carefully scouting out the businesses he would like to add to his current portfolio such as fashion, wine, RVs, ice cream, candy, pet supplies, cosmetics, furniture, restaurants, music equipment stores and many more!






 With multiple ventures on his resume, Marcus can be seen sharing his knowledge through numerous business and entertainment television programs, and is also regarded as one of the most sought-after industry experts and keynote speakers in the small business sector today.
Marcus drives results through collaborations, partnerships and relationships. His advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is simple: know your numbers, trust the process and remember that he’s 100 percent IN CHARGE!

Marcus Lemonis Reveals The 3 Keys To Business Success

Mike Periu
President, Proximo, LLC
Mike is a seasoned executive with experience in finance and management. He is the founder of Proximo, LLC. a leading provider of small business education and training services in both English and Spanish.

Mike Periu is also a leading national voice for individual empowerment through financial education and entrepreneurship. He has been interviewed over 500 times in national and international media, including NBC, Univision and CNN.

The Profit, CNBC’s small-business TV program starring entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis, was just renewed for a second season. The reality-based series follows Lemonis as he invests $2 million of his own money in small businesses that are struggling but have the potential for success. 
Lemonis couples his monetary investment with hands-on advice to the companies' founders and employees. If there's one person who was made for this type of show, it's Lemonis. He's the founder, chair and CEO of Camping World/Good Sam, a national retailer of recreational vehicles and related goods and services. The company generates more than $3 billion per year in sales and employs over 6,000 people—not bad for someone who hasn’t yet turned 40.
Lemonis’ passion for business led him to become a successful angel investor, and The Profit gives us a glimpse of the man in action. His interactions with small-business owners from across the country range from the unpredictable to the outrageous, as not everyone is comfortable taking advice that may conflict with how they currently run their companies. Unlike other semi-scripted reality shows that shoot for a happy ending, however, The Profit is honest about the outcomes—sometimes the deals work out, and sometimes they don’t.  
In all cases, however, Lemonis puts his three-part evaluation process to work, a process he claims has played an important role in his own company's success. He breaks down any business into these three key components: people, product and process. Here's how they affect the success or failure of a business, according to Lemonis.
People
Throughout all the first season episodes, Lemonis emphasized the importance of people for small-business success. But making sure you have the right people working for you is common knowledge to any entrepreneur. That's why Lemonis takes this basic advice a step further by showing business owners why it’s not just critical to have the right people—you have to have them in the right roles as well. In the episode dealing with ECO-ME, a producer of green cleaning materials, the company's founder had a trusted family member in a key sales position. But this person wasn't really a good fit for the sales position—the company had the right person in the wrong job.
It’s also important to create an "enabling" environment for your employees to ensure they can perform at their best for your company. LA Dogworks was a dysfunctional, dog-related services company. The owner had caring, thoughtful and dedicated employees who were constantly insulted, berated and belittled by the boss. Having the right people in place isn’t going to lead to success if they're in an environment where they're made to feel like failures. This episode reminded me of the mantra, “The beatings will continue until morale improves."
Product
Lemonis' second key ingredient is a company's product. In each episode, he carefully examines what's being sold and its key marketing characteristics, including pricing, packaging, sizing and targeting. Many times, small-business owners assume that consumers will view their product the same way they do, but that isn’t always the case. In the case of ECO-ME, the company decided to name their cleaning products after people they knew. But most consumers won’t clean their floors with something called “Ted”—it's just too odd of a name and wasn't clicking with customers. In the case of Planet Popcorn, a specialty popcorn manufacturer and retailer, modifying the packaging by creating a cleaner, more streamlined look allowed the company to sell its popcorn at dramatically higher margins.
Process
The final element, a company’s operations, is key to ensuring a business's efficiency and opportunities to scale. The most memorable episode related to failed processes was Planet Popcorn. The company makes and sells its specialty popcorn to corporate clients such as Disney as well as through county fairs. This mostly cash business had absolutely no procedures in place for managing its cash flow. Lemonis found piles of cash lying around everywhere. The end result? With no process in place, the company couldn’t account for $400,000 in cash profits, money which had basically disappeared.
If your company seems stuck and can't get to the level you'd like, take a look at the people, product and processes in place at your business. Lemonis' three-step evaluation process is logical, effective and easy to implement. I recommend it.
The Profit still has openings available for companies that want to be considered for the second season. Not only will you get national publicity on CNBC, you may also get an infusion of fresh capital and Marcus Lemonis as a not-so-silent partner.

  When Adelo Ramirez came to America at age five with little money or resources, no one suspected that he would, by 2000, open a successful, critically acclaimed restaurant, Los Gemelos, in Port Chester, New York. 
Ramirez worked three jobs, slept four hours a night, and saved up $40,000 of his own money so that he could use his passion for cooking to start a business. 
  By 2006, Ramirez had new ambitions: to manufacture tortillas for sale in local grocery stores. Not long after, he decided he wanted to become the biggest tortilla manufacturer in the world. 

  Unfortunately, that dream fell short. Though Ramirez's revenues approached half a million dollars shortly after he launched his tortilla line, by 2010, another large tortilla brand, Mission, had come to the east coast and "knocked us out big time," says Ramirez. Sales plummeted. Last year, Ramirez's revenue was just $220,000. 





  
Adelo Ramirez' tortilla factory, in operation since 2006, was netting the business only $196 each day and wasn't complying with U.S. safety codes.


  But on the latest episode of "The Profit," Ramirez redoubles his efforts to transform his struggling tortilleria into a major food brand with the help of entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis. 



  To become a global brand, Lemonis instructs Ramirez to make some changes. First, he has to close his shabby tortilla factory, which hasn't been complying with U.S. safety standards and is bleeding money. Then he has to start a new Hispanic food company. 
 The market for Hispanic foods is growing, according to Lemonis, and worth $18 billion in the U.S. alone. 
  Rather than focus exclusively on tortillas, Lemonis encourages Ramirez to pick three or four products that Mexican and non-Mexican communities would love. 
  "We want these products to be authentic but we want to make sure they appeal to everyone all over the country," Lemonis says. "We want to focus on the meat of the market right in the core, not on the fringes." 
  To determine the products in the market core, Ramirez and Lemonis meet with food distributor Tapia Brothers, a large, west coast distribution house familiar with the Hispanic market. Based on his knowledge of distribution, Erik Tapia, vice president of sales, recommends a trio of approachable, widely beloved products: chips, salsa, and tortillas. 
  Lemonis and Ramirez also do market research. They visit the popular grocery chain Gelson's in Los Angeles to see what Mexican products make the shelves. They find chips, salsa, and tortillas, but no mole, pan dulce or tamales — so Lemonis encourages Ramirez to stay away from those. 
 "While there may be little competition there, there is also little very demand," Lemonis explains.  





  
Partnering with actor and comedian George Lopez and using his face on all of "Ta Loco's" branding helps separate the brand from its competitors.


  Though chips, salsa, and tortillas are all products with lots of marketplace competition, Ramirez's offerings could still stand out, thanks to his partnership with comedian and actor George Lopez. Lopez has become a champion of Ramirez's restaurant and food business and agreed to lend recognition to the new brand in return for equity in the business and royalties.
Ramirez, Lemonis, and Lopez decide to name their new brand "Ta Loco," an homage to one of George Lopez's sayings. A cartoon of George Lopez's face will adorn the packaging. 
  The "Ta Loco" team will also create their products using fresh ingredients and home-made Mexican recipes – their plan is to remain authentic while also appealing to the masses. 





  
Ramirez's home-made salsa had a richness and kick to it, “but not so much kick that it would alienate people,” Marcus Lemonis pointed out.


Ramirez will not manufacture the foods himself; instead he'll partner with LA-based La Fortaleza, a manufacturer embedded in the Hispanic foods market. La Fortaleza already makes its tortillas with real corn and can ensure "Ta Loco" tortillas will have an authentic, traditional flavor while being able to deliver high capacity, too. 
  By the end of the episode, after employing Lemonis' recommendations, Ramirez successfully pitches the "Ta Loco" line of foods to warehouse retail chain Sam's Club. 
  "If you can nail Sam's Club, the sky's the limit," Lemonis says. 




CNBC's "The Profit" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EDT.

Marcus Lemonis


 

Host of The Profit





  There is no secret as to why self-made millionaire and serial entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis continues to make his mark on the business world. He leaves not just an impression, but an imprint on everyone he meets, and Lemonis has that charisma, if you will, that few possess.
On CNBC's "The Profit," Lemonis lends his expertise to struggling businesses in various industries across the country while using his famous People/Process/Product principle. Through his "Three P mantra," he analyzes every business by the quality of people, whether they have an excellent and relevant product, and the best possible process for creating, delivering, and selling that product. Since "The Profit" first premiered in July of 2013, Lemonis has invested nearly $50 million of his own money in the companies featured on the series.
  As a result of successful partnerships on CNBC's "The Profit," Lemonis has added a variety of new product lines and services to his holding company, Marcus Lemonis Enterprises LLC.

  Lemonis was born in war-torn Beirut, Lebanon in 1973; and, at nine months old, was adopted by a Lebanese and Greek couple living in Miami, FL. As a young child, he was exposed to positive and prosperous business values at his family-owned Anthony Abraham Chevrolet. His entrepreneurial spirit bloomed at age 12, when he started a lawn mowing service in order to generate money to open a candy business. He graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in Miami and moved to Milwaukee, WI to attend Marquette University, where he studied, Political Science, Criminology and Economics.
  Lemonis held several automotive sales and managerial roles, but it was a conversation with family friend and former Chrysler CEO, Lee Iacocca, who advised him to get into the camping and RV business, which put him on the path to eventual chairmanship at America's #1 source for RV's, camping accessories, RV maintenance and repair, Camping World and Good Sam.

Over the years, he has also contributed time and money to various organizations including: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Esperanza Community Services and the Lollipop Theater Network.
  Lemonis drives results through collaborations, partnerships and relationships. His advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is simple: know your numbers, trust the process, and remember that he's 100 percent in charge!

    ABOUT MARCUS
  


entrepreneur [ahn-truh-pruh-nur, -noo r] noun; 1. A person who organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable initiative and risk.


As an impressionable youth, Marcus Lemonis read the description of Entrepreneur to his mother from the dictionary while working on a school project, which inspired him to challenge himself and make his dreams come true. His humble beginnings and journey through life represent the heart and soul of what true entrepreneurism is. Although he was not born in America, he is proud to be living the American Dream through hard work, determination and believing; striving to take risks and show initiative while motivating people to do their best not by telling them what to do, but rather by showing them how to do it. Those who have had the chance to hear his story through his moving speaking engagements would say that he is humble, down to earth and 100 percent brutally honest.
    On CNBC’s reality series, The Profit, which returns for its fifth season in 2017, Marcus lends his business expertise to struggling businesses in various industries across the country while using his famous people-process-product principle. Through his 3P mantra, he analyzes every business by the quality people, whether they have an excellent and relevant product, and the best possible process for creating, delivering, and selling that product. Over 4 seasons of The Profit have aired since July of 2013 and more than $40 million dollars of his own money has been invested into helping these small businesses, and after experiencing tremendous success, his mission continues. While many people frequently call him the “business turnaround king,” he will be the first to say that he really helps people with tough love so they can use the experience to inevitably succeed. His new show, The Partner, will also premiere in 2017, in which candidates from diverse business backgrounds will compete for the opportunity of a lifetime - a position working alongside Lemonis and an equity stake in a multi-million-dollar company.
    Marcus was born in war-torn Beirut, Lebanon in 1973; and, at nine months old, was adopted by a Lebanese and Greek couple living in Miami, FL. As a young child, he was exposed to positive and prosperous business values at his family-owned business, Anthony Abraham Chevrolet. His entrepreneurial spirit bloomed at age 12 while attending Epiphany Catholic School, when he started a lawn mowing service in order to generate money to open a candy business while enlisting his friends for their help. He then graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in Miami and moved to Milwaukee, WI to attend Marquette University, where he studied Political Science, Criminology and Economics.
    He returned to Florida after graduation and ran for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives. At age 22, with no political experience, he gained the endorsement of the Miami Herald. Though he lost the campaign, Marcus refocused and held several automotive sales and managerial roles. It was a conversation with family friend and former Chrysler CEO, Lee Iacocca, who advised him to get into the camping and RV business, which put him on the path to eventual chairmanship at America’s #1 source for RVs, camping accessories, RV maintenance and repair, Camping World and Good Sam.
    Lemonis was recognized for having “more impact on the industry than any single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation,” when RV Business Magazine named him their 2007 Newsmaker of the Year. In addition, Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of “40 under 40,” and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him Entrepreneur of the Year. Prior to The Profit, he appeared on NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice in 2011 and 2012, and was also featured on ABC’s television show Secret Millionaire in 2012.
    Marcus is truly passionate about people. His philanthropy started in college, where he served as the president of Marquette’s Student Athletic Committee and planned a citywide clothing drive to help the homeless of Milwaukee. Over the years, he has also contributed time and money to various organizations near and dear to his heart.
    He receives hundreds of emails on a daily basis from people seeking business advice and investments, but as you may have seen on The Profit, he is not a bank, consultant or the fairy godmother. Marcus spends time carefully scouting out the businesses he would like to add to his current portfolio such as fashion, wine, RVs, ice cream, candy, pet supplies, cosmetics, furniture, restaurants, music equipment stores and many more!






 With multiple ventures on his resume, Marcus can be seen sharing his knowledge through numerous business and entertainment television programs, and is also regarded as one of the most sought-after industry experts and keynote speakers in the small business sector today.
Marcus drives results through collaborations, partnerships and relationships. His advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is simple: know your numbers, trust the process and remember that he’s 100 percent IN CHARGE!

Biography[edit]
Lemonis was born in Beirut, Lebanon, during the chaos of civil war and foreign invasions and was adopted during his infancy by Leo and Sophia Lemonis, a Greek couple living in Miami, Florida.[1] Lemonis was exposed to the automotive industry throughout his upbringing, his grandfather owning two of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States and Lee Iacocca serving as a family friend and later mentor to Marcus. Lemonis earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in criminology from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1995, and unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives shortly after his graduation,[2] whereupon he refocused his career on the automotive industry.
Business career[edit]
Starting in 1997, Lemonis held several sales and managerial roles for AutoNation.[2] From June 2001 to February 2003 he served as CEO of Holiday RV Superstores Inc. Following that, he co-founded a company called FreedomRoads and began acquiring RV dealerships.[3] In 2006, the company merged with Camping World with Lemonis as CEO, and then, in 2011, merged with Good Sam Enterprises, with Lemonis again at the helm.[4]
As the CEO of Camping World, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR for the first time in 2004, when the company sponsored driver John Andretti. In 2007, Lemonis and Camping World announced they were taking over sponsorship of the NASCAR East Series from Busch Beer for the 2008-09 seasons, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Series. Later that same year, they also announced sponsorship of the then Craftsman Truck Series, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, making the company one of the sport's top three sponsors.[5] In 2014, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR to renew Camping World's sponsorship of the Truck Series through 2022.[6]
Apart from Camping World, Lemonis is a serial entrepreneur and has helped several troubled businesses. Rose's Bakery & Wheat Free Café was set to close its doors on Christmas Eve of 2012 when Lemonis stepped in with an investment that allowed the bakery to remain open. He wrote an initial check for $200,000 to become the majority owner of the business with a commitment of an additional $150,000 investment over the next 18 months.[7] Not only did he save the existing bakery, but in March 2014 a second location in Highland Park, Illinois, was opened under his direction.[8] Lemonis added Rose's and several other businesses, including Amazing Grapes, Betty Lou's, Crumbs Bake Shop, Dapper Classics, E-Net IT Group, Key West Key Lime Pie Co., Little Miss Baker, Tonnie's Minis, Mr. Green Tea, ProFit Protein Bars and Sweet Pete's to his holding company, Marcus Lemonis Enterprises LLC. He also expanded his portfolio in the automotive industry with two businesses from The Profit: 1-800-Car-Cash,[9] an automobile buying service, and AutoMatch USA, which specializes in pre-owned automobiles and accessories.[10]
In 2007, RV Business Magazine named Lemonis "Newsmaker of the Year" for having "more impact on the industry than any [other] single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation."[11] Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of "40 under 40";[12] and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him "Entrepreneur of the Year". [13]
Lemonis' philanthropic efforts have included support for the Joffrey Ballet,[14][15] St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[16] Ravinia Festival,[17] Lincoln Park Zoo,[18] RV/MH Hall of Fame,[19] Zacharias Sexual Abuse Center,[20] and through his time on Secret Millionaire, he contributed his time and money to National Voices for Equality, Education and Enlightenment, New Journey's Transitional Home and Neat Stuff.[21]
Under his direction, Camping World and Good Sam launched Project Good Samaritan as part of their 2013 goal to foster corporate responsibility, which requires a team of nearly 7,000 employees to volunteer 32 hours per year (eight per quarter) to causes that are meaningful to them.[22]
In October 2016, Camping World went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWH) at $22 a share, giving the company a market value of approximately $2 billion. As of May 1, 2017, Camping World was trading above $31.[23]
In April 2017, Camping World announced the acquisition of the assets of Gander Mountain, a camping, fishing and hunting gear retailer, including Gander Mountain intellectual property and trademarks, GanderMountain.com and boating and watersports lifestyle retailer Overton's.[24]
Television personality[edit]
Lemonis was featured on two episodes of NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice,[25] hosting marketing-related challenges. In 2011, he gave each team two Camping World RVs and challenged them to stage an "experience" in midtown Manhattan.[26] In 2012, Lemonis challenged the contestants to write a 90-second jingle for Good Sam’s Roadside Assistance program [27] In 2012, Lemonis appeared on an episode of ABC’s Secret Millionaire,[28] returning to his hometown of Miami to help local charities.
In 2013, Lemonis became the star of the CNBC reality show The Profit,[29] which features Lemonis on the hunt for promising yet faltering small businesses. As of the summer of 2016, with the show in its fourth season, he puts his own money on the line to save the business and make himself a profit. After the third season, Lemonis had invested US$35 million in businesses featured in the program.[30]
In 2017, Lemonis will star in a second CNBC program The Partner, in which he searches for a business manager to assist in running businesses Lemonis invests in on The Profit. Lemonis will also co-produce.[30][31]
Political career[edit]
1996 Florida House campaign[edit]
Lemonis, appearing on the ballot as Marc Anthony Lemonis, lost to two-term Republican incumbent Bruno Barreiro, 42.44% to 57.56%,[32] despite being endorsed by the Miami Herald. The Miami Herald called Lemonis, a Democrat, a "political neophyte" but endorsed him because "he exudes energy and ideas."[33]

Biography[edit]
Lemonis was born in Beirut, Lebanon, during the chaos of civil war and foreign invasions and was adopted during his infancy by Leo and Sophia Lemonis, a Greek couple living in Miami, Florida.[1] Lemonis was exposed to the automotive industry throughout his upbringing, his grandfather owning two of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States and Lee Iacocca serving as a family friend and later mentor to Marcus. Lemonis earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in criminology from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1995, and unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives shortly after his graduation,[2] whereupon he refocused his career on the automotive industry.
Business career[edit]
Starting in 1997, Lemonis held several sales and managerial roles for AutoNation.[2] From June 2001 to February 2003 he served as CEO of Holiday RV Superstores Inc. Following that, he co-founded a company called FreedomRoads and began acquiring RV dealerships.[3] In 2006, the company merged with Camping World with Lemonis as CEO, and then, in 2011, merged with Good Sam Enterprises, with Lemonis again at the helm.[4]
As the CEO of Camping World, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR for the first time in 2004, when the company sponsored driver John Andretti. In 2007, Lemonis and Camping World announced they were taking over sponsorship of the NASCAR East Series from Busch Beer for the 2008-09 seasons, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Series. Later that same year, they also announced sponsorship of the then Craftsman Truck Series, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, making the company one of the sport's top three sponsors.[5] In 2014, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR to renew Camping World's sponsorship of the Truck Series through 2022.[6]
Apart from Camping World, Lemonis is a serial entrepreneur and has helped several troubled businesses. Rose's Bakery & Wheat Free Café was set to close its doors on Christmas Eve of 2012 when Lemonis stepped in with an investment that allowed the bakery to remain open. He wrote an initial check for $200,000 to become the majority owner of the business with a commitment of an additional $150,000 investment over the next 18 months.[7] Not only did he save the existing bakery, but in March 2014 a second location in Highland Park, Illinois, was opened under his direction.[8] Lemonis added Rose's and several other businesses, including Amazing Grapes, Betty Lou's, Crumbs Bake Shop, Dapper Classics, E-Net IT Group, Key West Key Lime Pie Co., Little Miss Baker, Tonnie's Minis, Mr. Green Tea, ProFit Protein Bars and Sweet Pete's to his holding company, Marcus Lemonis Enterprises LLC. He also expanded his portfolio in the automotive industry with two businesses from The Profit: 1-800-Car-Cash,[9] an automobile buying service, and AutoMatch USA, which specializes in pre-owned automobiles and accessories.[10]
In 2007, RV Business Magazine named Lemonis "Newsmaker of the Year" for having "more impact on the industry than any [other] single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation."[11] Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of "40 under 40";[12] and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him "Entrepreneur of the Year". [13]
Lemonis' philanthropic efforts have included support for the Joffrey Ballet,[14][15] St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[16] Ravinia Festival,[17] Lincoln Park Zoo,[18] RV/MH Hall of Fame,[19] Zacharias Sexual Abuse Center,[20] and through his time on Secret Millionaire, he contributed his time and money to National Voices for Equality, Education and Enlightenment, New Journey's Transitional Home and Neat Stuff.[21]
Under his direction, Camping World and Good Sam launched Project Good Samaritan as part of their 2013 goal to foster corporate responsibility, which requires a team of nearly 7,000 employees to volunteer 32 hours per year (eight per quarter) to causes that are meaningful to them.[22]
In October 2016, Camping World went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWH) at $22 a share, giving the company a market value of approximately $2 billion. As of May 1, 2017, Camping World was trading above $31.[23]
In April 2017, Camping World announced the acquisition of the assets of Gander Mountain, a camping, fishing and hunting gear retailer, including Gander Mountain intellectual property and trademarks, GanderMountain.com and boating and watersports lifestyle retailer Overton's.[24]
Television personality[edit]
Lemonis was featured on two episodes of NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice,[25] hosting marketing-related challenges. In 2011, he gave each team two Camping World RVs and challenged them to stage an "experience" in midtown Manhattan.[26] In 2012, Lemonis challenged the contestants to write a 90-second jingle for Good Sam’s Roadside Assistance program [27] In 2012, Lemonis appeared on an episode of ABC’s Secret Millionaire,[28] returning to his hometown of Miami to help local charities.
In 2013, Lemonis became the star of the CNBC reality show The Profit,[29] which features Lemonis on the hunt for promising yet faltering small businesses. As of the summer of 2016, with the show in its fourth season, he puts his own money on the line to save the business and make himself a profit. After the third season, Lemonis had invested US$35 million in businesses featured in the program.[30]
In 2017, Lemonis will star in a second CNBC program The Partner, in which he searches for a business manager to assist in running businesses Lemonis invests in on The Profit. Lemonis will also co-produce.[30][31]
Political career[edit]
1996 Florida House campaign[edit]
Lemonis, appearing on the ballot as Marc Anthony Lemonis, lost to two-term Republican incumbent Bruno Barreiro, 42.44% to 57.56%,[32] despite being endorsed by the Miami Herald. The Miami Herald called Lemonis, a Democrat, a "political neophyte" but endorsed him because "he exudes energy and ideas."[33]

Why A Self-Made Millionaire Puts His Money On The Line For Struggling Small Businesses

  In 2003, entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis started buying up RV
  dealerships with his company, FreedomRoads. Three years later, he
  merged it with parts and accessories dealer Camping
  World. Now, the combined
  company is a $3
  billion business that controls 25% of the entire RV
  market. 

Going into that business wasn't
  an accident. Lemonis deliberately chose an industry he thought he
  could dominate, a decision sparked by what he calls the best
  piece of advice he's ever gotten.

Many entrepreneurs can trace
  their careers back to a powerful lesson learned on the way or a
  wise mentor. Not all of them get the help of Lee Iaccoca, the man
  who helped create the first Mustang, turned around a nearly
  bankrupt Chrysler, and remains one of the most legendary figures
  in American business.

"The best advice I ever got was
  from Lee Iaccoca, who was very influential in my career," Lemonis
  told Business Insider. "It was very simple. It was get into a business
  where you can be a big fish, not the little fish. Get into a
  business where you can be a change
  agent, 
where you can
  make a difference. It's worked well for me."

  Indeed, Lemonis has become a very big fish. And he's taking that
  advice, and everything he's learned over 13 years leading
  businesses, and using it to help others. In addition to his "day
  job" as CEO of Camping World and its parent company Good S,
  Lemonis is the host of CNBC's "The Profit," a primetime
  reality show in which Lemonis tries to save struggling
  businesses. But rather than just giving advice, he puts his own
  money and reputation on the line. 





"I wanted people to know that
  this wasn't just a fresh coat of paint on the
  wall, that these were real stakes," Lemonis
  says. "If you want to get somebody interested, you put money on
  the table. You don't go in there and tell them how smart you are
  or impress them by telling them what your credentials are. You go
  in there and stand side by side and put your money up."

  The experience has had a real impact on the businesses
  Lemonis has invested in. It's taught him a lot
  as well.

  "What I know now is that running a small business is as hard as
  running a big business," Lemonis says. "It also
  reaffirmed my belief that people are the ones that make the
  difference. My greatest takeaway is how important or unimportant
  people can be — how effective or how destructive they can be if
  they're not the right people."

Lemonis judges every business
  by what he calls the people-process-product principle: Great
  people, an excellent and relevant product, and the best possible
  process for creating, delivering, and selling that
  product. 

Beyond people, Lemonis noticed
  one common mistake among business owners that he finds
  particularly irksome. 
"People don't know their numbers," he says,
  referring to everything from inventory and price points to the
  company's balance sheet. "Nothing infuriates me
  more." 

Everything in business boils
  down to knowing how cash is flowing through the business, Lemonis
  says. He's remained in touch with all of the participants in the
  show, and he hears frequently how much knowing their numbers has
  positively impacted their businesses. 

Lemonis was in his 20s when he
  first got into the RV business. Before starting FreedomRoads, he
  worked his way up to managing 67 stores for AutoNation
  by the
  time he was 27. And he readily admits he made his share
  of errors.

"When I was young, I said
  things I shouldn't have; I did things I shouldn't have,"
  Lemonis says. "I don't know that I could have
  necessarily re-charted that course. The benefit is that I learned
  lessons, and it helped me mature over time."

Doing the show and putting his
  own money on the line is about more than making good investments
  or even good TV, he says. It's about getting some of those
  lessons out there, so people don't have to make the same mistakes
  he did.  
"I really look
  at this in two ways: One, as a way for me to make a good return
  on my investment, and second, as an educational tool for
  everybody, including myself," Lemonis says. "We want to pick
  businesses and concepts and topics that are real and raw and
  understandable. Whether it's family-owned businesses, integrity,
  second-generation businesses, or controls of cash, they're all
  themes that are essential."

Ken McCarthy -  Internet, marketing, and beyond










Is Marcus Lemonis an idiot? 
By Ken McCarthy in Business advice 

Let me cut straight to the chase and answer that question up front.
No, but I’ll explain why some people might think so – and why they’re wrong.
But first, this article assumes you know who Marcus Lemonis is and took my advice last month to watch his show on CNBC called “The Profit.” (It’s on Tuesday nights at 10 PM.)
Lemonis takes his own money and buys into struggling businesses. He takes control of the business’ finances permanently and the operations long enough to get the business from intensive care (and failing) deep into the profit zone.
In the first three episodes, he’s one for three.
In all three cases, he massively improved the business, but two out of three times, his partners – to be blunt – screwed him.
So doesn’t that make him an idiot? 
After all, isn’t it the sign of a business genius to never get screwed?
It might be – in Fantasyland – but in the real world you’re going to find over and over again that character  and even basic sanity are in short supply.
You can do a lot of due diligence on people, but at the end of the day, the only reliable way to find out about someone is to get involved with them. Then you find out a lot – and fast.
Here’s one lesson from the show I recommend you bank right now: When people you’re doing things with start acting squirrely or don’t do what they say they’re going to do, confront them right away – not in an antagonistic way, but in a clear way.
You may be at fault for not being clear or the other person may be at fault for violating an agreement. It doesn’t matter. The point is to sort out expectations and draw a line in the sand quickly about what is and what is not acceptable.
You don’t need flakes in your life and the first time someone “flakes” is the first time to call them on it. Anything else it to invite and prolong misery.
Perspective on cash
Cash is king and if you’ve got it it should be treated that way, especially when a business is on its death legs.
Does it make sense to put $100,000 or more into a business before you really know your partners?
Yes…if you’ve got $2 billion in net worth as Lemonis does.
$100,000 is 0.005 % of $2 billion. (That’s the proportional equivalent of $50 to a person with $1 million.)
Does it make sense for you or me? Probably not. In fact, certainly not…but there’s a number that you can risk without risking your financial life and sanity.
Know that number and do not exceed it.
Futures traders say that never bet more than 5% of your position on any one idea. That’s not a bad place to start thinking about the issue, but keep in mind, if you’re wrong ten times in a row – and it can happen – it’s going to hurt and hurt a lot.
Is Lemonis a gambler?
In one sense, yes. He’s gambling that the business owner is honest, sane and competent.
In another sense, no because he is absolutely not gambling that the numbers of the business can be fixed.
The deals he picks have massive upsides and limited and predictable downsides.
If he’s wrong on the people, he loses a month of his time and $100,000 (the time is worth far more to him that the money.)
But if he’s right…
The popcorn deal 
Let’s look at one deal.
The company manufactures and retails popcorn at amusement parks. They were grossing around $ 2 million a year in sales.
The owner claimed to be losing money (at least that’s what she told her mother who mortgaged her home to keep the business solvent.)
Lemonis’ deal was to put in $100,000 for a 50% share of profits and use his expertise to get the business to $10 million a year in sales rapidly and from there – who knows how high?
Not a bad offer for a failing company at death’s door.
Some forensic accounting revealed that instead of losing money, the company was spinning off $400,000 in cash (that turned out to be missing.) Weird, but not unheard of.
Being conservative, assume that $10 million in sales (4x the sales) would only double that amount from $400,000 to $800,000.
If so, then Lemonis’ one-time investment of $100,000 and some sweat equity on the front end and ongoing deal making and advice, would yield him $400,000+ a year every year.
Let’s see: $100,000 in once and $400,000+ out every year…
That’s a deal to jump at. That’s a risk/reward ratio that makes sense.
Unfortunately, the popcorn lady turned out to be a flake (or worse) and the front end investment of time and money went down a black hole.
But remember, this was chump change to Lemonis and the upside was well worth the risk. Realistic potentials like that don’t grow on trees.
What Lemonis is doing very, very right 
Real money is made by owning businesses. Not by stock speculating or real estate flipping or multi-level marketing or any other number of fantasy businesses.
(Yes, there are people who can make things like this work, but they are few and far between and they are a lot more circumstantial than most “successful” practitioners would like to believe. Also, the financial graveyard is full of “successful” traders and real estate operators who leverage themselves to death.)
Business owning, if you’ve got the stomach and guts for it, is where it’s as a wealth building tool. Just ask Warren Buffet. The world’s most successful “investor” is in reality, they world’s most successful business collector.
Let someone else run it – the money is in the deal making
Owning businesses can be massively profitable. On the other hand, operating businesses much less so.
For one thing, being in charge of daily operations greatly limits your opportunities. Operations and deal making just don’t mix. If you’re fixing the broken washing machine in your laundromat, it’s kind of hard to be out looking for new laundromats to buy.
And even if you had the super human energy to deal with the endless daily operational issues of a business and be out beating the bushes for new opportunities, you wouldn’t have much of a life – and, even if you could , that level of energy expenditure is not sustainable by anyone in the long run no matter how energetic.
Buy “way below wholesale”
The highest price you’ll ever pay for anything is to go into a high end retail store and pay the full price on the sales ticket.
No one does that voluntarily – even millionaires – unless they’re in a mad rush to get something.
Yet every year thousands of people with very limited means pay absolute top dollar for businesses and shares of businesses.
Why?
They’re intimidated, uninformed and/or over eager.
Of course the seller of the business thinks his business is worth a fortune – or wants you to think that too so you’ll pay one.
Don’t do it.
Smalls business are VERY hard to sell.
Why?
The market is super thin.  It’s not like a house where anyone of hundreds of families could happily own it. You may well be the only potential buyer on earth. That puts you, not the seller, in the driver seat. Get in it and stay in it. Your cash is king and their alternative might very well be zero. Keep that in mind at all times.
Buy “losers”
Don’t buy the shiny profitable business. The sellers, usually, aren’t going to give you any deals. Instead, buy broken business that can be fixed – easily and cheaply. The good news is that many can.
Most small businesses are horribly mismanaged and neglected. Some, in spite of that, are sitting on very real gold mines.
Sometimes all that’s needed are some very simple improvements to go from cash burning dog to a money machine. Just on the marketing side alone, I’ve participated in overnight transformations of businesses (and careers) dozens of times. It’s not rare.
Product improvement, personnel improvement (new people and/or better training and incentives), and operations improvement are other areas where a dead business can often be brought back to life very quickly with a relatively small investment.
That’s the zone that Lemonis is playing in. That’s where you want to play too if you’re buying a business or buying into one. 

Look at LOTS of deal
This is an essential lesson of business and life.
Too many people stumble onto something, fall in love with it, and then tie their future to it without doing any meaningful research or exploring lots of alternatives.
Falling in love with a business is a disaster in the making.
If a business is not solidly in the black or has the potential to get there fast, pass and go on to something else and do it today.
I cannot tell you the number of people I’ve seen waste years and years of precious time, hoping that something that cannot and will not work is suddenly going to improve.
The only way to fall into this trap is to have a scarcity of opportunity – and the only way to have that is to be passive, wait for deals to come to you and not be out there every day talking to people and looking at other potentials.
I think the average person has no idea how many “deals” you need to look at to find a good one. Of course, you can be lucky, but if you assume 1 out of 100, you’ll be in safe territory.
“The mine is bigger than the gem.” People who find gems have systems for digging and sifting through lots and lots of dirt. And they work very hard at their systems whatever they are.
“Forever” businesses
As a guy who has made his money on the bleeding edge of technology, I envy the people who are in “forever” businesses. In fact, I’ve transitioned from tech to businesses like that and I’m running about 50/50 right now.
Lemonis is in “forever” businesses that are also relatively simple to run (i.e. you can hire people to do the work while you find more deals.)
Look at his first three deals:
– A company that buys (and then re-sells) used cars from consumers
– A high end florist in a prime retail location in a prosperous US city
– A company that sells popcorn in amusement parks
Tell me, when are these businesses going to become “obsolete?”
When, short of a direct asteroid strike, are people going to: a) stop needing to sell their used cars fast without getting skinned by a traditional used car dealer, b) stop buying flowers for weddings, funerals, parties, gifts, and life in general and c) stop going to fun places and buying snacks.
The only company that’s vulnerable to the ravages of time is the florist. The city he’s in might go bad and its currently valuable location and market might be worth a whole lot less – but the company’s methods are portable and can be leveraged into dozens if not hundreds of outlets in more favorable locations long before that happens.
Is the business you’re going into “forever” or is it a pet rock…or a VHS rental store.
Finally, the biggest lesson of all
I don’t know Lemonis so I can’t tell whether I like him or not. How could I based on a television portrayal?
But here are two things I like about him a lot:
1. He’s not afraid of work
2. He’s not afraid of getting bloodied
Two of the three deals didn’t work. So what?
Too many people: a) wildly underestimate how much time and energy it takes to make things happen and b) put a small effort into one thing and then cry into their milk for the rest of their lives when it doesn’t work out just they way they hoped it would.
The world doesn’t work that way.  Like the rest of humanity, you probably won’t “get lucky.”  In the pursuit of a better life you’ll stub your toe, get knocked down, get rear ended at a stop light etc. more than once.
You can turn these events into tragic events that define your life (“The popcorn lady screwed me”) or you can get on to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing until you find the things that do work.
The mine is bigger than the gem.
If you want a “gem”, get out your shovel and pick and prepare to use you muscles (in business your mind) like you never used them before.
Oh, and learn to read a balance sheet. Lemonis clearly can – and so can Warren Buffet. Most business owners are allergic to them. Don’t be one of them. That’s where score is kept – but that’s another article for another day.

Q:
Why do airplanes take longer to fly west than east?


A:

When planes fly from west to east, the jet stream helps accelerate the aircraft. When they fly in the opposite direction, the planes cannot fly as fast into the face of the wind.

Q:
What is dangerous about radio waves?


A:
When radio waves pass through the human body at extremely high doses, they can break down tissue and damage DNA structure. Radio waves have been linked to headaches, multiple sclerosis and sleep disorders and may contribute to more serious illnesses like cancer and brain tumors. However, some argue that the only scientifically proven negative side effect of radio waves is a rise in temperature in the substance through which the waves pass, and the debate is fierce as to the true effects of radio waves in humans.

Biography[edit]
Lemonis was born in Beirut, Lebanon, during the chaos of civil war and foreign invasions and was adopted during his infancy by Leo and Sophia Lemonis, a Greek couple living in Miami, Florida.[1] Lemonis was exposed to the automotive industry throughout his upbringing, his grandfather owning two of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States and Lee Iacocca serving as a family friend and later mentor to Marcus. Lemonis earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in criminology from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1995, and unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives shortly after his graduation,[2] whereupon he refocused his career on the automotive industry.
Business career[edit]
Starting in 1997, Lemonis held several sales and managerial roles for AutoNation.[2] From June 2001 to February 2003 he served as CEO of Holiday RV Superstores Inc. Following that, he co-founded a company called FreedomRoads and began acquiring RV dealerships.[3] In 2006, the company merged with Camping World with Lemonis as CEO, and then, in 2011, merged with Good Sam Enterprises, with Lemonis again at the helm.[4]
As the CEO of Camping World, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR for the first time in 2004, when the company sponsored driver John Andretti. In 2007, Lemonis and Camping World announced they were taking over sponsorship of the NASCAR East Series from Busch Beer for the 2008-09 seasons, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Series. Later that same year, they also announced sponsorship of the then Craftsman Truck Series, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, making the company one of the sport's top three sponsors.[5] In 2014, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR to renew Camping World's sponsorship of the Truck Series through 2022.[6]
Apart from Camping World, Lemonis is a serial entrepreneur and has helped several troubled businesses. Rose's Bakery & Wheat Free Café was set to close its doors on Christmas Eve of 2012 when Lemonis stepped in with an investment that allowed the bakery to remain open. He wrote an initial check for $200,000 to become the majority owner of the business with a commitment of an additional $150,000 investment over the next 18 months.[7] Not only did he save the existing bakery, but in March 2014 a second location in Highland Park, Illinois, was opened under his direction.[8] Lemonis added Rose's and several other businesses, including Amazing Grapes, Betty Lou's, Crumbs Bake Shop, Dapper Classics, E-Net IT Group, Key West Key Lime Pie Co., Little Miss Baker, Tonnie's Minis, Mr. Green Tea, ProFit Protein Bars and Sweet Pete's to his holding company, Marcus Lemonis Enterprises LLC. He also expanded his portfolio in the automotive industry with two businesses from The Profit: 1-800-Car-Cash,[9] an automobile buying service, and AutoMatch USA, which specializes in pre-owned automobiles and accessories.[10]
In 2007, RV Business Magazine named Lemonis "Newsmaker of the Year" for having "more impact on the industry than any [other] single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation."[11] Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of "40 under 40";[12] and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him "Entrepreneur of the Year". [13]
Lemonis' philanthropic efforts have included support for the Joffrey Ballet,[14][15] St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[16] Ravinia Festival,[17] Lincoln Park Zoo,[18] RV/MH Hall of Fame,[19] Zacharias Sexual Abuse Center,[20] and through his time on Secret Millionaire, he contributed his time and money to National Voices for Equality, Education and Enlightenment, New Journey's Transitional Home and Neat Stuff.[21]
Under his direction, Camping World and Good Sam launched Project Good Samaritan as part of their 2013 goal to foster corporate responsibility, which requires a team of nearly 7,000 employees to volunteer 32 hours per year (eight per quarter) to causes that are meaningful to them.[22]
In October 2016, Camping World went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWH) at $22 a share, giving the company a market value of approximately $2 billion. As of May 1, 2017, Camping World was trading above $31.[23]
In April 2017, Camping World announced the acquisition of the assets of Gander Mountain, a camping, fishing and hunting gear retailer, including Gander Mountain intellectual property and trademarks, GanderMountain.com and boating and watersports lifestyle retailer Overton's.[24]
Television personality[edit]
Lemonis was featured on two episodes of NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice,[25] hosting marketing-related challenges. In 2011, he gave each team two Camping World RVs and challenged them to stage an "experience" in midtown Manhattan.[26] In 2012, Lemonis challenged the contestants to write a 90-second jingle for Good Sam’s Roadside Assistance program [27] In 2012, Lemonis appeared on an episode of ABC’s Secret Millionaire,[28] returning to his hometown of Miami to help local charities.
In 2013, Lemonis became the star of the CNBC reality show The Profit,[29] which features Lemonis on the hunt for promising yet faltering small businesses. As of the summer of 2016, with the show in its fourth season, he puts his own money on the line to save the business and make himself a profit. After the third season, Lemonis had invested US$35 million in businesses featured in the program.[30]
In 2017, Lemonis will star in a second CNBC program The Partner, in which he searches for a business manager to assist in running businesses Lemonis invests in on The Profit. Lemonis will also co-produce.[30][31]
Political career[edit]
1996 Florida House campaign[edit]
Lemonis, appearing on the ballot as Marc Anthony Lemonis, lost to two-term Republican incumbent Bruno Barreiro, 42.44% to 57.56%,[32] despite being endorsed by the Miami Herald. The Miami Herald called Lemonis, a Democrat, a "political neophyte" but endorsed him because "he exudes energy and ideas."[33]

Biography[edit]
Lemonis was born in Beirut, Lebanon, during the chaos of civil war and foreign invasions and was adopted during his infancy by Leo and Sophia Lemonis, a Greek couple living in Miami, Florida.[1] Lemonis was exposed to the automotive industry throughout his upbringing, his grandfather owning two of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States and Lee Iacocca serving as a family friend and later mentor to Marcus. Lemonis earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in criminology from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1995, and unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives shortly after his graduation,[2] whereupon he refocused his career on the automotive industry.
Business career[edit]
Starting in 1997, Lemonis held several sales and managerial roles for AutoNation.[2] From June 2001 to February 2003 he served as CEO of Holiday RV Superstores Inc. Following that, he co-founded a company called FreedomRoads and began acquiring RV dealerships.[3] In 2006, the company merged with Camping World with Lemonis as CEO, and then, in 2011, merged with Good Sam Enterprises, with Lemonis again at the helm.[4]
As the CEO of Camping World, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR for the first time in 2004, when the company sponsored driver John Andretti. In 2007, Lemonis and Camping World announced they were taking over sponsorship of the NASCAR East Series from Busch Beer for the 2008-09 seasons, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Series. Later that same year, they also announced sponsorship of the then Craftsman Truck Series, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, making the company one of the sport's top three sponsors.[5] In 2014, Lemonis teamed up with NASCAR to renew Camping World's sponsorship of the Truck Series through 2022.[6]
Apart from Camping World, Lemonis is a serial entrepreneur and has helped several troubled businesses. Rose's Bakery & Wheat Free Café was set to close its doors on Christmas Eve of 2012 when Lemonis stepped in with an investment that allowed the bakery to remain open. He wrote an initial check for $200,000 to become the majority owner of the business with a commitment of an additional $150,000 investment over the next 18 months.[7] Not only did he save the existing bakery, but in March 2014 a second location in Highland Park, Illinois, was opened under his direction.[8] Lemonis added Rose's and several other businesses, including Amazing Grapes, Betty Lou's, Crumbs Bake Shop, Dapper Classics, E-Net IT Group, Key West Key Lime Pie Co., Little Miss Baker, Tonnie's Minis, Mr. Green Tea, ProFit Protein Bars and Sweet Pete's to his holding company, Marcus Lemonis Enterprises LLC. He also expanded his portfolio in the automotive industry with two businesses from The Profit: 1-800-Car-Cash,[9] an automobile buying service, and AutoMatch USA, which specializes in pre-owned automobiles and accessories.[10]
In 2007, RV Business Magazine named Lemonis "Newsmaker of the Year" for having "more impact on the industry than any [other] single individual or company in recent memory as an agent of change and retail consolidation."[11] Crain’s Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of "40 under 40";[12] and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him "Entrepreneur of the Year". [13]
Lemonis' philanthropic efforts have included support for the Joffrey Ballet,[14][15] St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[16] Ravinia Festival,[17] Lincoln Park Zoo,[18] RV/MH Hall of Fame,[19] Zacharias Sexual Abuse Center,[20] and through his time on Secret Millionaire, he contributed his time and money to National Voices for Equality, Education and Enlightenment, New Journey's Transitional Home and Neat Stuff.[21]
Under his direction, Camping World and Good Sam launched Project Good Samaritan as part of their 2013 goal to foster corporate responsibility, which requires a team of nearly 7,000 employees to volunteer 32 hours per year (eight per quarter) to causes that are meaningful to them.[22]
In October 2016, Camping World went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWH) at $22 a share, giving the company a market value of approximately $2 billion. As of May 1, 2017, Camping World was trading above $31.[23]
In April 2017, Camping World announced the acquisition of the assets of Gander Mountain, a camping, fishing and hunting gear retailer, including Gander Mountain intellectual property and trademarks, GanderMountain.com and boating and watersports lifestyle retailer Overton's.[24]
Television personality[edit]
Lemonis was featured on two episodes of NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice,[25] hosting marketing-related challenges. In 2011, he gave each team two Camping World RVs and challenged them to stage an "experience" in midtown Manhattan.[26] In 2012, Lemonis challenged the contestants to write a 90-second jingle for Good Sam’s Roadside Assistance program [27] In 2012, Lemonis appeared on an episode of ABC’s Secret Millionaire,[28] returning to his hometown of Miami to help local charities.
In 2013, Lemonis became the star of the CNBC reality show The Profit,[29] which features Lemonis on the hunt for promising yet faltering small businesses. As of the summer of 2016, with the show in its fourth season, he puts his own money on the line to save the business and make himself a profit. After the third season, Lemonis had invested US$35 million in businesses featured in the program.[30]
In 2017, Lemonis will star in a second CNBC program The Partner, in which he searches for a business manager to assist in running businesses Lemonis invests in on The Profit. Lemonis will also co-produce.[30][31]
Political career[edit]
1996 Florida House campaign[edit]
Lemonis, appearing on the ballot as Marc Anthony Lemonis, lost to two-term Republican incumbent Bruno Barreiro, 42.44% to 57.56%,[32] despite being endorsed by the Miami Herald. The Miami Herald called Lemonis, a Democrat, a "political neophyte" but endorsed him because "he exudes energy and ideas."[33]
