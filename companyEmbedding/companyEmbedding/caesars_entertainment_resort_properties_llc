                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Caesars Entertainment Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter 2016



LAS VEGAS, May 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) today reported first quarter 2016 results as summarized in the discussion below, which highlights certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.

Highlights

Net revenues for Continuing CEC increased 6.7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion primarily attributable to growth in Caesars Interactive Entertainment's ("CIE") social and mobile games business and strength in hospitality offerings. 
Adjusted EBITDA for Continuing CEC grew 15.9% year-over-year to $349 million. 
Net revenues for CIE increased 28.8% year-over-year to $228 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 41.3% to $89 million due to organic growth in social and mobile games resulting from greater monetization of monthly unique paying users. 
Cash ADR in Las Vegas rose 9.4% driven by increased resort fees, improved hotel yield and greater pricing power as a result of the recapitalization of room product.
"Enterprise-wide, including CEOC, we delivered all-time record adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved over 200 basis points due to higher hospitality revenue growth, particularly in lodging, where we are investing in an upgraded room product, and increased average revenue per user in Caesars Interactive Entertainment.  Additionally, we continue to demonstrate improved execution discipline and to deliver quantifiable savings on our efficiency initiatives," said Mark Frissora, President and CEO of Caesars Entertainment.
"Our focus on driving margin and cash flow improvements while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and employee engagement has enhanced our financial performance. As we continue to execute on our cornerstone initiatives, we believe this provides a solid foundation to create long-term value for our stakeholders," concluded Frissora.
Summary Financial Data
The results of CEOC and its subsidiaries are no longer consolidated with Caesars subsequent to CEOC and certain of its United States subsidiaries (the "Debtors") voluntarily filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") on January 15, 2015.
In the table below, "Continuing CEC" represents CERP, CGP Casinos, CIE, other non-operating subsidiaries and associated parent company and elimination adjustments that represent the Caesars consolidated reporting entity as of March 31, 2016, and for subsequent periods.
Supplemental materials have been posted on the Caesars Entertainment Investor Relations website at http://investor.caesars.com/financials.cfm.
First quarter 2016 results below include Caesars Entertainment's additional accrual of $237 million related to its estimate of the additional amount it will pay to support the restructuring of CEOC. As negotiations among all parties associated with the restructuring are ongoing, the amount ultimately paid by Caesars Entertainment to support the restructuring will likely change.

First Quarter 2016 Financial Results
We view each casino property and CIE as operating segments and currently aggregate all such casino properties and CIE into three reportable segments based on management's view of these properties which aligns with their own ownership and underlying credit structures: CERP, Caesars Growth Partners Casino Properties and Developments ("CGP Casinos"), and CIE. CGP Casinos is comprised of all subsidiaries of CGP excluding CIE. CIE is comprised of the subsidiaries that operate CGP's social and mobile games operations, regulated online real money gaming, and the World Series of Poker ("WSOP"). CEOC was a reportable segment until its deconsolidation effective January 15, 2015.
Segment results in this release are presented consistent with the way Caesars management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the impact of certain transactions between reportable segments within Caesars, as described below. Accordingly, the results of certain reportable segments presented in this filing differ from the financial statement information presented in their stand-alone filings. "Other" includes parent, consolidating, and other adjustments to reconcile to consolidated Caesars results. All comparisons are to the same period of the previous year.

CERP
CERP owns and operates six casinos in the United States and The LINQ promenade, along with leasing Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace Las Vegas to CEOC and gaming space at The LINQ promenade to CGP.
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2016 were $528 million, flat compared with the prior year as lower gaming revenues were offset by hotel revenue growth as well as other revenue increases driven by the Harrah's Atlantic City Waterfront Conference Center (the "Atlantic City Conference Center"), located adjacent to Harrah's Atlantic City. Construction disruption affected revenues at Harrah's Las Vegas as we had a number of rooms out of service from the renovations taking place at the property. Casino revenues were $272 million, down 3.9% from the prior year due to lower slot volumes at our non-Las Vegas properties and 
Harrah's Las Vegas. Room revenues rose 5.4% in the quarter to $136 million mainly due to resort fees and improved hotel yield, which drove a 10.6% increase in cash ADR. Food and beverage revenues were $134 million, up 1.5%. 
Income from operations was $78 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.5% to $158 million mainly due to lower gaming revenues and higher labor expenses, which more than offset the benefits from marketing efficiencies and improved hotel customer mix.  A meaningful portion of the increase in labor expenses was related to the ramp up of the Atlantic City Conference Center.   Hold was estimated to have a positive adjusted EBITDA impact of approximately $0 million to $5 million in the quarter relative to our expectation and there was minimal impact to adjusted EBITDA when comparing to the prior year period.
CGP Casinos
CGP Casinos owns and operates six casinos in the United States, primarily in Las Vegas.
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2016 were $416 million, a 6.7% increase primarily attributable to strong hotel revenues from The LINQ Hotel & Casino due to the renovations completed in the second quarter of 2015 as well as increases in entertainment revenue at Planet Hollywood. Casino revenues were $258 million, relatively flat from the prior year mainly due to lower gaming volumes at Harrah's New Orleans as a result of the smoking ban that went into effect in local bars, restaurants and casinos citywide on April 22, 2015. Room revenues increased 25.7% in the quarter to $93 million as a result of an increase in total rooms available at The LINQ Hotel & Casino and resort fees. Food and beverage revenues were $72 million, 
up 5.9%.  
Income from operations was $63 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 23.5% to $105 million mainly due to net revenue increases and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a minimal impact to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter relative to our expectation and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0 million to $5 million to adjusted EBITDA when comparing to the prior year period.
CIE
CIE owns and operates (1) an online games business providing social and mobile games, (2) regulated online real money gaming and (3) the WSOP tournaments and brand.
Net revenues for the first quarter of 2016 were $228 million, a 28.8% increase. Income from operations was $54 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 41.3% to $89 million. The increase in revenue and adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by the continued focus on conversion and monetization of users to increase revenue per user.
CEOC
CEOC owns and operates 19 casinos in the United States and nine internationally, most of which are located in England, and managed 15 casinos, which included the six CGP casinos and nine casinos for unrelated third parties. Effective October 2014, substantially all of our properties are managed by CES (and the remaining properties will be transitioned upon regulatory approval).
CES is a joint venture among CERP, CEOC, and a subsidiary of CGP that provides certain corporate and administrative services to their casino properties.
Balance Sheet and Other Items
Cash and Available Revolver Capacity
CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations, employees, or material debt issuances of its own. CEC's primary assets as of March 31, 2016, consist of $218 million in cash and cash equivalents and its ownership interests in CEOC, CERP and CGP.  Each of the subsidiary entities comprising Caesars Entertainment's consolidated financial statements have separate debt agreements with restrictions on usage of the respective entity's capital resources. CGP is a variable interest entity that is consolidated by Caesars Entertainment, but is controlled by its sole voting member, Caesars Acquisition Company ("CAC"). CAC is a managing member of CGP and therefore controls all decisions regarding liquidity and capital resources of CGP. CEOC was 
deconsolidated effective January 15, 2015, and therefore, has not been included in the table below. In the table below, "Other" reflects CEC and its direct subsidiaries excluding CERP, CES, CGP and CEOC. CEC has limited cash available to meet its financial commitments, primarily resulting from significant expenditures made to defend against litigation related to the CEOC restructuring and to support a plan of reorganization for CEOC. While the cash forecast at CEC currently contemplates liquidity to be sufficient through the end of the year, the CEC cash balance will be consumed by expenses associated with the CEOC restructuring unless we identify additional sources of liquidity to meet CEC's ongoing obligations as well as to meet its commitments to support the CEOC restructuring. If CEC is unable to obtain additional sources of cash when needed, in the event of a material 
adverse ruling on one or all of our ongoing litigation matters, or if CEOC does not emerge from bankruptcy on a timely basis on terms and under circumstances satisfactory to CEC, it is likely that CEC would seek reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

About Caesars
Caesars Entertainment is the world's most diversified casino-entertainment provider and the most geographically diverse U.S. casino-entertainment company. CEC is mainly comprised of the following three entities: wholly owned Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties ("CERP"), Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ("CGP"), in which we hold a variable economic interest, and the majority owned operating subsidiary Caesars Entertainment Operating Company ("CEOC") (which was deconsolidated effective January 15, 2015 due to its bankruptcy filing). Since its beginning in Reno, Nevada, in 1937, CEC has 
grown through development of new resorts, expansions and acquisitions. The Caesars system of properties now operates 49 casinos in 14 U.S. states and five countries. CERP and CGP operate a total of 12 casinos. CEC's resorts operate primarily under the Caesars®, Harrah's®, and Horseshoe® brand names. CEOC's portfolio also includes the Caesars Entertainment UK (formerly London Clubs International) family of casinos.
The Caesars system of properties is focused on building loyalty and value with its guests through a unique combination of great service, excellent products, unsurpassed distribution, operational excellence, and technology leadership. The Company is committed to system-wide environmental sustainability and energy conservation and recognizes the importance of being a responsible steward of the environment. For more information, please visit www.caesars.com.
Caesars Entertainment Corporation is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. It owns Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC ("CERP"), an interest in Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ("CGP") and various other non-operating subsidiaries. It also has majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ("CEOC"). The results of CEOC and its subsidiaries are no longer consolidated with CEC subsequent to CEOC's Chapter 11 filing on January 15, 2015. Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ("CES") provides certain enterprise services to properties owned and/or operated by CERP, CGP, and CEOC, and this press release at times refers to system-wide trends 
and dynamics, inclusive of CEOC and its subsidiaries. In the discussion in this release, the word "CEC" refers to Caesars Entertainment Corporation without its consolidated entities, and the words "Company," "Caesars," "Caesars Entertainment," "Continuing CEC," "we," and "our" refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities, and not CEOC unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise.
Forward Looking Information
This release includes "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events. Further, these statements contain words such as "may," "would," "estimate," "continue," "focus," "will," "expect," "believe," or "position", or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology. In particular, they include statements relating to, among other things, future actions, new projects, strategies, future performance, the outcomes of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, the restructuring of CEOC, and future financial results of Caesars. These forward-looking statements are based 
on current expectations and projections about future events.
Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified, and, consequently, the actual performance of Caesars may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following factors, and other factors described from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained therein):

the ability to retain key employees during the restructuring of CEOC; 
the event that the Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreements ("RSAs") may not be consummated in accordance with their terms, or persons not party to the RSAs may successfully challenge the implementation thereof;

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATIONSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATIONTO PROPERTY EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA
Property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance.  Property EBITDA is defined as revenues less property operating expenses and is comprised of net income/(loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) corporate expenses, and (v) certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance at an operating property level.  In evaluating Property EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.  The presentation of Property EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected 
items.
Property EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income/(loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP).  Property EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry.  Property EBITDA is included because management uses Property EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Property EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash and other items as exhibited in the following reconciliation, and is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information and allows a better understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the long-term benefit of the Company. In addition, compensation of management is in part determined by reference to certain of such financial information. As a result, we believe this supplemental information is useful to investors who are trying to understand the results of the Company.
Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
The following tables reconcile net income/(loss) attributable to the companies presented to Property EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC Key Developments

Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC Announces Amendments to Credit Agreement
May 12 17
May 12, 2017, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC entered into an Amendment No. 1, by and among CERP, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties Finance Inc., the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Citicorp North America Inc., as Administrative Agent. The amendment amends the First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of October 11, 2013, among CERP, CERP Finance, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto and the administrative agent. Among other things, the amendment reduces the interest rate margins applicable to approximately $211 million of CERP's existing $270 million revolving credit facility to, at CERP's option, the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) plus 3.50% in the case of Eurocurrency Loans or the ABR plus 2.50% in the case of ABR Loans, with further reductions to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 3.25% or the ABR plus 2.25%, respectively, at such time as CERP's Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0 and (b) reduces the interest rate margins applicable to CERP's existing approximately $2.4 billion term loan facility to, at CERP's option, the Eurocurrency Rate plus 3.50% in the case of Eurocurrency Loans or the ABR plus 2.50% in the case of ABR Loans. The portion of the Revolving Facility that was not repriced under the Amendment will remain in effect with the existing interest rate margins.


Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC Reprices its $2.4 Billion Senior Secured Term Loan Facility
May 10 17
Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced that Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC has successfully repriced its approximately $2.4 billion senior secured term loan facility (the Term Facility). The interest rate under the Term Facility is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 350 basis points. This represents a reduction of 250 basis points. CERP also repriced approximately $211 million of its approximately $270 million revolving credit facility to LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The CERP repricing lowers CERP’s overall cost of capital, which will benefit the enterprise. The repricing is the latest step in the effort to optimize the balance sheet and improve free cash flow across the enterprise, following the recently announced repricing of certain debt of Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC (CGPH). The closing of the CERP repricing transaction is anticipated to occur the week of May 8, 2017, subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
