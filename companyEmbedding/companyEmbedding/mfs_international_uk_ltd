Webcast


Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.
