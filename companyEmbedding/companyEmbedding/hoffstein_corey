What I Do






I love investing and I am a hacker at heart.  I love exploring ideas, moving fast, being agile and adaptive.  I can get gritty and dive into code or I can stay high level and work on fleshing out business plans.


Describe what you have done, what you are doing, and the kinds of things you are interested in.









What I'm Looking For






Looking for small firms in a unique vertical that solve a real problem.  Demonstrable leverage in the business model is a MUST.  Dynamic cost of growth must be low -- sweat & time over $$.  Ideally, business runs without much overhead cost or maintenance.

The Correlation Boundary

Newfound Research LLC, October 26, 2012

Corey  Hoffstein Newfound Research

Date Written: October 26, 2012

Abstract
A significant amount of time at Newfound is appropriated to quantitative strategy construction. Implicit in mandating quantitative integrity is developing intuition around investment strategy behaviors, throughout the construction process. During one of our strategy deep-dives we discovered a phenomenon that seemed contrary to our initial intuition. Specifically, we assumed that implementing an investment strategy over different time intervals, i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, etc. over the same time horizon, would lead to uncorrelated returns. However, we discovered that no matter the interval the correlation never fell below a certain minimum threshold. We then discovered the same behavior when exploring the joint-behavior of different investment strategies that utilize the same underlying assets.In this paper we mathematically prove the existence of this "correlation boundary." Specifically, we prove that any portfolio will have a correlation to its underlying assets greater than or equal to the minimum pairwise correlation between the assets. We call this minimum correlation level the Correlation Boundary. After proving this boundary, we extend the proof in multiple ways, eventually leading to our ultimate implication: any two investment or trading strategies will always have a correlation to each other that equals or exceeds the minimum pairwise correlation of the set made from the union of their individual underlying assets, no matter the investment horizon of the two strategies. 



Keywords: correlation, correlation boundary, joint-dependence
