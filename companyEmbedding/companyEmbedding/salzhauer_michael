Meet “Dr. Miami” Michael Salzhauer




Bal Harbour Plastic Surgery:
“Dr. Miami” Michael Salzhauer, M.D., FACS
Board-certified Miami plastic surgeon and Nose Job Specialist, Michael Salzhauer, M.D., FACS is not just an internationally recognized plastic surgeon, but an author and inventor as well.
As a renowned cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon in Miami, FL, Dr. Michael Salzhauer has become known for his extensive experience and cutting edge techniques with procedures such as rhinoplasty (nose job), breast enhancements including breast augmentations, lifts and reductions, body contouring including his trademarked Genius Liposuction, Brazilian Butt Lifts (buttocks augmentation), Tummy Tucks and Mommy Makeovers, male cosmetic enhancements including gynecomastia (male breast reduction) nose and chin reshaping, and facial rejuvenation including eye, brow, face and neck lifts along with non-surgical anti-aging treatments such as Botox, Dysport, dermal fillers and chemical peel.

Prior to owning and operating his private cosmetic surgery facility and surgical center, Bal Harbour Plastic Surgery Associates, Dr. Michael Salzhauer began his journey of becoming an expert in the field of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery through extensive training and education. He was educated at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri and he was trained in the latest plastic surgery techniques while serving on the staff of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach; the University of Miami Medical Center; and the prestigious Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Dr. Miami maintains the highest standards and has been certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, and is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeon.
Dr. Miami’s talents are not limited to the practice and the art of cosmetic enhancements through surgery alone. He has utilized different multi media outlets allowing him to continue his passion for cosmetic surgery. He is the author of the internationally acclaimed book “My Beautiful Mommy,” a children’s book explaining the phases of plastic surgery which has proven to be an invaluable tool for parents in communicating with their children. He is also the inventor of multiple iphone and online cosmetic surgery related applications. His very successful iPhone app, iSurgeon, allows users to alter images of themselves to see what they would look like with cosmetic surgery. His online application, Heidi Yourself, which was commissioned by MTV UK, allows users to see what they could look like with any of the 10 cosmetic surgeries that Heidi Montag allegedly had performed. Stemming from those successes, led to multiple variations of the application including his latest, Pet Plasty, an online application allowing users to alter the image of their pets.
Dr. Salzhauer’s reputation as an expert in the field of cosmetic surgery as well as a knowledgeable and entertaining media resource has gained him much media attention. He has been featured in national and international television appearances such as CBS, NBC, CNN and FOX News, The Today Show, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, in Hispanic media such as Univision, Telemundo and el Nuevo Herald, and publications such as The Miami Herald, New York Times, News of the World, Allure Magazine Life & Style, In Touch, Star, Us and Ok weekly magazines to name a few.

Miami Plastic Surgeon and Nose Job Specialist Dr. Michael Salzhauer Receives Prestigious Patient’s Choice Award for 2010.
This top rating has only been awarded to a chosen few of the nation’s most highly regarded physicians, of which a very select few being plastic surgeons. The Patients’ Choice Award is an honor that reflects the difference a doctor made in people’s lives through the exceptionally high praise granted to a doctor by the patients.
“It is such an honor to be recognized as a top surgeon and awarded the Patient’s Choice Award. The real honor in this award is that I was chosen by the patients, which speaks volumes. I am so grateful to have been part of their journey of enhancing their appearance and their life”, stated Dr. Salzhauer.
Every month, more than 40,000 patients across the U.S. provide online feedback about their experiences with their doctors. They rate various components such as bedside manner, doctor-patient face time, degree of follow-up, courtesy of office staff, and overall opinions. While physicians generally receive positive reviews from their patients, only a select few receive uniformly rave reviews across the board. Of those that receive rave reviews, only the few physicians with near perfect scores have been voted by their patients for this honor.
“At Bal Harbour Plastic Surgery Associates our mission is to provide beautiful results in the safest environment while giving each patient an exceptional plastic surgery experience involving superior customer service and attention. I am so proud of my entire team for helping me fulfill this mission,” stated Dr. Salzhauer.
