Market Update
Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise Global Market Strategist

Email




As of 7/12/2017
Looking back

International stocks led markets higher over the first six months of the year
Through mid-July, the S&P 500 Index advanced 10.3% year-to-date
Tech and health care were sector leaders, while energy and telecom lagged the broader market

Up ahead

Improvement in consumer confidence and employment trends could lift personal spending
Earnings trends will likely shape stock market performance in the second half
Less accommodative monetary policy from central banks has the potential to stall momentum

Data Source: FactSet
  
Market Update: Is the market's pace sustainable?
 
A strong first half
Stocks proved resilient during the first half of the year, posting strong gains across multiple categories and regions. While Asian and emerging market stocks led markets higher over the first six months, European equities also turned-in sizeable gains.
Improving corporate and economic conditions across Europe, accompanied by what markets considered to be favorable election results in the Netherlands and France, helped boost regional sentiment. Though the United Kingdom is arguably in a weakened position as it starts “Brexit” negotiations with the European Union, UK stocks advanced sharply through the first half.  
Here at home, information technology was the winner of the S&P 500 sectors in the first half of the year based on total returns year-to-date, as investors gravitated toward stocks that could grow faster than the overall economy. However, momentum came to an abrupt halt as the second quarter ended. Elevated valuations as well as rotational trading into health care and financial stocks in June sapped enthusiasm for some of the world’s largest tech names. The S&P 500 health care sector finished the second quarter on a strong note, generating double-digit gains guided by a late quarter surge in the biotech segment. This occurred even as Congress struggled to pass health care reform legislation.
Equity investors appeared content despite the onslaught of several headline issues that could have derailed stock prices during the first half of 2017. Political drama, falling oil prices, rising tensions with North Korea and slower than expected growth were all potential justifications to hit the pause button. Nevertheless, stock prices currently sit at or near record highs, posing an interesting question for investors as the second half gets underway – is the market’s pace sustainable?
Equity investors believe stocks can go higher
Investors focused on stocks tend to be an optimistic bunch. More times than not, they view the glass as half-full and turn negative only when evidence clearly suggests weaker economic conditions are imminent. Simply put, we believe there is little reason for investors to be pessimistic today.
The latest updates on employment and consumer confidence suggest economic growth should continue, while S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) are expected to grow in the second half of the year. Though equity valuations are elevated by historical standards, when adjusted for current inflation and interest rate levels, stock values appear to be more reasonable. Globally, monetary policy is still accommodative and economic growth and corporate profits are trending higher.
In such a “Goldilocks” environment (not too hot, not too cold), it’s natural for investors to ratchet up expectations.
Bond investors see the world differently
Fixed income investors tend to be more conservative among the Wall Street crowd. Their view of longer-term inflation and growth has come down over recent months. Although economic data trended higher, surprises to the upside have been few and far between since March.
Until recently, 10-year government bond yields across the developed world stood near their lowest levels of the year.
Until recently, 10-year government bond yields across the developed world stood near their lowest levels of the year. This indicates bond investors are more cautious about the possibility that growth and inflation trends can outpace longer-term averages.
As expectations have been tempered and the comments of central bankers have taken a more hawkish tone, fixed income investors remain more skeptical of future economic growth.      
Maintain a balanced portfolio
If economic and corporate conditions continue to improve in the second half of the year, we believe forward guidance from the world’s largest central banks could become more restrictive. This could create headwinds for stock momentum in the coming months.
Yet we remain optimistic that the fundamental backdrop remains supportive. Stock prices have an opportunity to move modestly higher from here. For investors, maintaining an appropriate portfolio balance between stocks and bonds based on your investment objectives and risk tolerance level is likely a beneficial course of action today.
