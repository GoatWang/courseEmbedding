Carbonics Capital Corporation http://www.carbonicscapital.com/        Current Share Structure as of MAY 20th, 2010 Authorized shares - 10,000,000,000 Outstanding shares - 2,202,943,349 as of JUNE 29th, 2010 Authorized shares - 10,000,000,000 Outstanding shares - 2,879,307,216   Carbonics Taps Dr. Paul Miller for CEO    The Board of Directors of Carbonics Capital Corporation (OTCBB: CICS) has appointed Paul T. Miller, Ph.D. to the position of president and chief executive officer.   Prior to his acceptance of the position of president and CEO of Carbonics, Dr. Miller was the founder and president of Sustainable Systems, an oilseed processing facility specializing in the production of high oleic vegetable oils for food applications. Dr. Miller has a hands-on understanding of the challenges faced by early stage development projects and companies including diverse experience in finance, sales, marketing, product development and operations. Dr. Miller earned a B.S. in Chemistry from Radford University and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Montana.   “Carbonics will focus on technological development and services that decarbonizes and increases efficiency within industry and commerce,” said Dr. Miller. “Our plan to build shareholder value involves the development and use of technologies that decrease carbon and energy intensity coupled with the monetization of those reductions to help drive our growth.” Carbonics’ first project involves its planned acquisition of the Sustainable Systems oilseed crush facility in Culbertson, Montana from GreenShift Corporation (OTCBB: GERS), and the restructuring and repositioning of this facility as a strategic location for the processing of carbon-neutral second generation feedstocks for biofuel applications. In addition, Carbonics intends to invest in the development of technology to manufacture carbon-negative third generation feedstocks for biofuel and specialty chemical applications.   Dr. Miller stated, “I am energized by Carbonics’ technology, services, business development and overall growth opportunities. It remains extremely important that the private sector continue to develop and invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technology that has diverse applications across industry and commerce. We are collectively, as a society, facing unprecedented challenges in the form of resource scarcity and global climate change. We believe that development of second and third generation feedstocks that help to streamline the flow of carbon through, out and back into commerce presents a compelling opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the resolution of these challenges.”       The Earth’s natural carbon cycle is out of balance.  We produce carbon dioxide in just about everything we do, starting with breathing. An average person will exhale about 23 tons of carbon dioxide over an average life span of 70 years. The 6 billion people on our planet produce about 2 billion tons per year of carbon dioxide at zero industrial activity.  Fossil fuel combustion and other industrial processes release about 26 billion tons per year of carbon dioxide (containing 7 billion tons of carbon). While this represents only about 1% of the estimated total amount of carbon resident in the atmosphere, natural processes have not been able to balance out the increase.  This is evidenced by the fact that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have risen 35% from pre-industrial levels of about 280 parts per million to the current level of about 380 parts per million.  While each new part per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a total of 7.7 billion new tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide, half of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed into the Earth’s oceans and forests.  This means that human activity has released about 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide (containing 420 billion tons of carbon) into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial era. The total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the early 1800s was about 2.1 trillion tons; the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is about 2.9 trillion tons.  At current and expected rates of production, we will release another 2.7 trillion tons of carbon dioxide (containing 756 billion tons of carbon) during the next 50 years, and the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be about 4.3 trillion tons. This corresponds to an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 560 parts per million, which is /double/ the pre-industrial concentration.  The Earth’s natural mechanisms for processing carbon dioxide are not keeping up with us. We need to help if severe climate change is to be avoided.  New technologies will be needed to stem the tide, reverse the flow and ultimately shut off the tap, but we can take action immediately. The first critical steps are simply to be smarter about how we consume fossil fuels and to use carbon-neutral fuels as much as possible.  http://www.greenshift.com/whoweare.php?mode=5  SEC Filings   Carbonics Capital Corp. http://www.sec.gov./cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=CARBONICS+CAPITAL+CORP&CIK=&filenum=&State=&SIC=&owner=include&action=getcompany   _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________      ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   (Updated 29 June 2009 - Lightbeam)

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

BIG AND TALL PANTS & SHORTS FOR MEN

Of all the items of clothing that the big and tall man struggles with, perhaps none is more bothersome than pants. If there is ever a time when the cut has to be right, this is it. As one progresses into larger waist sizes, it doesn't always mean there are changes through the thigh as well. The same goes for taller men; some men are tall with skinnier legs, while other tall men have sturdier legs. From waist, to thigh, to length, to style there are so many factors to take into consideration when buying big and tall pants for men.

To ensure you have plentiful choices from the most trusted brands in the world, Westport Big & Tall proudly carries big and tall pants for men from Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Bahama, Cutter & Buck and many more.
