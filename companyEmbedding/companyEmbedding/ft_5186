Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

                    If you have been thinking about upgrading to a larger home or a different neighborhood but have been putting it off until the real estate market improves then it may be time to bite the bullet. The bull market is back in Ocala, but who knows for how long. Low inventory of homes for sale coupled with increasing buyer demand has created a seller's market once again. Even new construction has resumed, a tell tale sign that prices are up. Don't be fooled though, the market is not back to its record highs, but prices are up and houses are selling within days of being listed and frequently with multiple offers. This is fantastic news for the Ocala real estate market and for your if you are thinking about selling your home. The first step is to contact a local realtor who can perform a comparative market analysis of your home's value so that you know what to expect going forward. Don't let the seller's market pass you by. Seize the opportunity to sell your home today.
