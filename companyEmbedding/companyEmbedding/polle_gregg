Former Citi Big Shot Gregg Polle Just Landed An Awesome Job At A Casino

Gregg PolleCiti's former head of the industrial group, who retired in 2008, just got a fantastic new job.
Polle was elected to sit on the board of directors of the Monticello Casino and Raceway for a three-year term.
You know what that means. Polle will enjoy fun business trips to Monticello, a gambling resort just outside of New York City. And if he's lucky, profitable gambling trips, comped nights at the casino, and a box seat at the Monticello Raceway too.
In other words, a home away from home 90 minutes outside of the city in Monticello, New York, for at least the next three years. 
What a way to retire!
Here's a little background on Polle. He earned a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
Soon after he graduated, he started at Citi in 1983 as a financial analyst and was later promoted to the co-head of the mergers and acquisitions group. Then he became the head of the industrial group. In 2008, he retired, and three men were promoted to replace him.  
“After 25 great years I just felt I was getting a bit stale and it was time to try something else,” he told The Street at the time.
Sitting on the board of a casino and raceway is a fine way to spice things up.
The promotion of an investment banker to a casino board might also say a few things about the gambling industry. 
First, that they're trying to better appeal to i-banker types, perhaps because signs that they're ditching Atlantic City (which is struggling financially - Gov Chris Christie has had to fight off in-state competition to try to keep the halls from "financial freefall," according to one article. Gaming revenues have apparently dropped from $5.3 billion annually a few years ago to $4 billion.) worry casino owners. 
Second, that casinos are stepping up expert consultation to fight off competition from the ever-growing online gambling industry.
And also that there's a growing presence of gambling houses outside of Atlantic City that are trying to draw the crowds away from New Jersey.
Whatever the reason, the outcome is awesome for one guy: Gregg Polle. Good luck out there!

Commercial Power Systems for Rent
For industries ranging from construction and agriculture to healthcare and data processing, a reliable source of prime and backup power is an absolute necessity. Gregory Poole is a local heavy equipment dealer offering comprehensive rental power solutions in Raleigh, NC and throughout the entire region. We carry all of the power generation equipment you need to remain productive and compliant in virtually any environment.
As the authorized Cat® dealership for Eastern North Carolina, we’re a premier source of top quality commercial power systems for rent. We carry an extensive fleet of power generators and related equipment and accessories ranging from 20kW to 2mW. Our experienced team of experts will assist in analyzing your needs in order to identify the power rental equipment in North Carolina that represents the most efficient fit.
Our rental power solutions include:

Low-hour, late–model genuine Cat power equipment
Backup, mobile and prime power generators
Custom–configured gen sets and complete power systems
Full range of generator parts and accessories 

Our factory-trained experts fully inspect all generators. We deliver rental equipment ready to use and in excellent working condition. We can even provide training and related consulting services to ensure your team knows how to properly set up, install and run your rental unit.

Why Cat?
Cat power systems deliver exceptional reliability, user-friendly operation and industry-leading fuel efficiency. If you are only renting for a few days, you’ll appreciate how easy it is to train your team on your equipment. For longer-term needs, you’ll benefit from increased savings on fuel and lower maintenance requirements that keep uptime maximized.
A wide range of air compressors, switchgear, UPS and more support Cat generators. Designed to work together seamlessly, a complete Cat power system is the ideal choice for any rental need.
Matching You With the Equipment You Need to Succeed
Choosing a rental generator or other power supply equipment isn’t as easy as picking the most powerful unit your budget can afford. While there is an obvious risk to underestimating your requirements, a too-powerful generator can have drawbacks, too. Because most standby and prime power systems run best when working at between 50-75% of their rated capacity, overly powerful gen sets will burn excess amounts of fuel, costing you money and potentially jeopardizing system performance.
One of the benefits of working with a Cat power system expert such as Gregory Poole is that our rental associates have the training necessary to match you with the right equipment for your project. Contact one of our rental locations near you today to get started.
Why Rental Power in North Carolina Makes Sense
In many circumstances, owning power generation equipment simply isn’t possible. Gregory Poole provides a fast, convenient and affordable way to rent power generation systems in Raleigh and across our service territory. We’ll help you get the most out of your budget while accessing the first-rate power support you require when and where you need it most.
There are several obvious reasons why you would want to rent a generator or other power system from Gregory Poole. The majority of our clients do so for temporary power during a one-time event, such as a concert or festival. They also can be useful when your crew is working in a remote location where transporting your own equipment isn’t cost-effective.
Renting power generation equipment from Gregory Poole is also an effective strategy for any business:

Lacking the storage space or ability to transport large generators
Not interested in making the large capital investment of purchasing new equipment
With frequently changing projects and power system requirements
Focused on reducing spending while maximizing productivity
Experiencing a power outage or emergency situation

Fast and Convenient Power Rental Equipment
Eastern North Carolina is Gregory Poole territory for superior rental equipment solutions. In addition to a complete line of the most effective and efficient models of Cat rental generators, we provide the best service, knowledge and technical support in the industry. And with locations to rent power generation systems throughout eastern NC, you never have to travel far to find exactly what you need.
Additional benefits of choosing our rental services include:

Flexible daily, weekly, monthly and longer–term rentals
Exceptional availability via the extensive Cat dealer network
Contingency planning tailored to your emergency requirements
24/7 emergency support throughout our service territory
Expert guidance in choosing the right rental power solutions

Contact Us About Commercial Power Systems for Rent in NC
Give us a call, get in touch online or drop by the Gregory Poole rental location in your area for more information. We’ll be happy to help put together a contingency plan to ensure your business remains productive and regulatory compliant in the event of a power emergency.
