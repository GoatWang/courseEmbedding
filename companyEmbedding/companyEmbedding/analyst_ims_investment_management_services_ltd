Is Your Net Worth Greater Than You Think?Our mission is to help you understand your net worth – what you have minus what you owe – through the Personal Capital Dashboard.Know Your Net Worth Link Your Investing,  Retirement & Bank Accounts 
As well as credit accounts such as a mortgage, home equity and credit cards.
Get a complete picture of your net worth, any time, on any device.
Not sure what net worth is all about? Learn more about
the only figure that really matters.Watch The DemoWhat is Net Worth?Your net worth is an equation: every significant thing you own (assets) minus what you owe (your debts and other liabilities).			LiabilitiesIncludes what you may owe on your assets and other debts, such as a mortgage, car and student loans, and credit card debt.AssetsIncludes cash, investments such as IRAs, 401k accounts, other retirement accounts, bonds, and stocks, your home and other valuables such as your vehicles and jewelry. Simply put, net worth illustrates the amount in cash you would have left over after selling all of your assets to pay your liabilities, providing a measure of your overall financial health and stability. Your net worth can either be negative or positive.Why Knowing Your Net Worth MattersCompare yourself to others - track your progress as compared to the average net worth for your age or income bracket.Median US Household Net WorthAs shown in this chart, the median US household net worth is not sufficient for most investors to realize a comfortable retirement. Net worth peaks at retirement age for those 65+ since house and property values may account for the majority of the net worth calculation. For younger age brackets, net worth is impacted by holding significant debt such as a mortgage and student loans, along with lower salaries and assets, but over time these investments may result in higher net worth households.Measure your progress over timeFocus on the big pictureRealize the impact of your debts	Having multiple investments and income streams is a good thing, but keeping track is a major pain point for most investors. Using the Personal Capital dashboard will help you to quickly access a consolidated view of all your accounts in one place. Each time you log into the dashboard, on desktop or mobile, you’ll see a complete view of your net worth. Over time, you’ll see if your net worth is trending positively and take steps to make adjustments in your spending and savings habitsMonitoring your net worth is a sound strategy for avoiding the tendency of less experienced investors to focus on the daily fluctuations in market performance. Using the Personal Capital dashboard to track your net worth, you are no longer held hostage by market volatility.Tracking your net worth will highlight your debt situation and help put these liabilities into focus. Discover how carrying debt can erode your retirement savings and how hidden account fees can accumulate to cost you years off your retirement.Track Your Portfolio Performance 
It’s important to know how your net worth is changing over time, so you can meet your long- and short-term financial goals.Learn how individual investments are performing, or review your entire portfolio at once. View performance by 
month, year or over the lifetime of your accounts with our easy-to-use portfolio tracking tools.Want more information about following your portfolio?

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Somewhat Favorable News Coverage Somewhat Unlikely to Affect Corning (NYSE:GLW) Share Price

Posted by Tim Parker on Jul 25th, 2017 // No Comments 

Media headlines about Corning (NYSE:GLW) have trended somewhat positive on Tuesday, according to Accern Sentiment Analysis. The research group rates the sentiment of media coverage by analyzing more than twenty million blog and news sources in real-time. Accern ranks coverage of companies on a scale of negative one to positive one, with scores closest to one being the most favorable. Corning earned a news impact score of 0.22 on Accern’s scale. Accern also gave news headlines about the electronics maker an impact score of 46.9030466174146 out of 100, meaning that recent media coverage is somewhat unlikely to have an impact on the company’s share price in the immediate future.

Is Your Net Worth Greater Than You Think?Our mission is to help you understand your net worth – what you have minus what you owe – through the Personal Capital Dashboard.Know Your Net Worth Link Your Investing,  Retirement & Bank Accounts 
As well as credit accounts such as a mortgage, home equity and credit cards.
Get a complete picture of your net worth, any time, on any device.
Not sure what net worth is all about? Learn more about
the only figure that really matters.Watch The DemoWhat is Net Worth?Your net worth is an equation: every significant thing you own (assets) minus what you owe (your debts and other liabilities).			LiabilitiesIncludes what you may owe on your assets and other debts, such as a mortgage, car and student loans, and credit card debt.AssetsIncludes cash, investments such as IRAs, 401k accounts, other retirement accounts, bonds, and stocks, your home and other valuables such as your vehicles and jewelry. Simply put, net worth illustrates the amount in cash you would have left over after selling all of your assets to pay your liabilities, providing a measure of your overall financial health and stability. Your net worth can either be negative or positive.Why Knowing Your Net Worth MattersCompare yourself to others - track your progress as compared to the average net worth for your age or income bracket.Median US Household Net WorthAs shown in this chart, the median US household net worth is not sufficient for most investors to realize a comfortable retirement. Net worth peaks at retirement age for those 65+ since house and property values may account for the majority of the net worth calculation. For younger age brackets, net worth is impacted by holding significant debt such as a mortgage and student loans, along with lower salaries and assets, but over time these investments may result in higher net worth households.Measure your progress over timeFocus on the big pictureRealize the impact of your debts	Having multiple investments and income streams is a good thing, but keeping track is a major pain point for most investors. Using the Personal Capital dashboard will help you to quickly access a consolidated view of all your accounts in one place. Each time you log into the dashboard, on desktop or mobile, you’ll see a complete view of your net worth. Over time, you’ll see if your net worth is trending positively and take steps to make adjustments in your spending and savings habitsMonitoring your net worth is a sound strategy for avoiding the tendency of less experienced investors to focus on the daily fluctuations in market performance. Using the Personal Capital dashboard to track your net worth, you are no longer held hostage by market volatility.Tracking your net worth will highlight your debt situation and help put these liabilities into focus. Discover how carrying debt can erode your retirement savings and how hidden account fees can accumulate to cost you years off your retirement.Track Your Portfolio Performance 
It’s important to know how your net worth is changing over time, so you can meet your long- and short-term financial goals.Learn how individual investments are performing, or review your entire portfolio at once. View performance by 
month, year or over the lifetime of your accounts with our easy-to-use portfolio tracking tools.Want more information about following your portfolio?

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.
3The RIABiz listing of the 10 most influential figures in the Registered Investment Advisor industry is in recognition of notable, driven and influential executives who are advancing their firms and are considered to be influential in the RIA business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
