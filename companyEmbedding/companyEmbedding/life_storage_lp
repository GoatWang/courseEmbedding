Before you select your boxes, note that you will need packing tape to put them together. Packing tape is available in different size rolls – we recommend the larger of the two rolls because the difference in price is very little and you will likely use all the tape.
One 60-yard roll will tape:

12 - 14 small boxes
10 - 12 medium boxes
8 - 10 large or extra large boxes






Tip: Tape like a pro
Review the following recommended taping method to help ensure secure seams while helping to prevent crushing:


1. Fold in the shorter flaps first
2. Fold in long flaps and secure with three strips of tape down the center
3. Place two final strips perpendicular about three inches from the box edge






 Tip: Dishes and Fragile Items
Be sure to wrap your dishes and fragile items carefully to protect them during moving and storage. We have everything you need including:

Bubble Pack – Superior protection for fragile items
Dish Packs and Glass Packs
Newsprint wrapping paper
Labels for marking boxes







 Tip: Choosing the Right Boxes
When packing boxes for storage, do not use boxes from supermarkets, liquor stores or other food and beverage retail outlets. Food odors remain in the cardboard and can attract pests and rodents into the storage space. We want to do everything we can to protect your belongings and those of your storage neighbors.
As boxes age, they become weaker in the walls.  Be sure that your boxes are strong and can stand up to the pressure of stacking one on top of another.  During your move and during storage, boxes that collapse can make a terrible mess!





Moving Boxes and Packing Supplies Guide 
Packing up your home means you need more than just a few boxes; you'll need tape, bubble pack, and newsprint, as well. To ensure you have all the packing supplies you need, consider purchasing moving supplies from Life Storage, using the charts below as reference.

Check out our guide to storage unit environments, and find the right one for the items you'll store.

 Home  Company
Life Storage, Inc.


Life Storage, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages self-storage properties throughout the United States. Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, the company employs over 1,600 people and operates approximately 650 self-storage facilities encompassing over 45 million square feet in 29 states.
Life Storage, Inc. currently operates under the brand names Life Storage® and Uncle Bob’s Self Storage®, and is one of the largest self-storage companies in the world.
Founded in 1982, the company was originally a financial planning firm but opened its first self-storage facility in Florida in 1985. Within three years, it owned approximately 30 facilities along the East Coast and accumulated 62 facilities over the next decade. Life Storage was originally known as Sovran Self Storage, Inc., operating under the brand name Uncle Bob’s Self Storage beginning in the late 1980s. 
Life Storage went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, trading under the name Sovran Self Storage. Within a year, it grew its holding to 111 self-storage facilities along the East Coast and Texas. Life Storage doubled to 222 facilities by 1999 and by 2003 operated in 21 states. 
Life Storage continued its acquisitions throughout the United States, expanding into cities such as Chicago, New York, Atlanta, and St. Louis. It operated 478 facilities by the end of 2013 and 500 facilities by the end of 2014. It made its way to the West Coast in 2016, acquiring California-based LifeStorage LP. 
The company rebranded from Sovran Self Storage, Inc. to Life Storage in 2016 and now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LSI (formerly NYSE:SSS).
Throughout 2017, all Uncle Bob’s locations will be rebranded to Life Storage – a name that more closely depicts the Company’s customer-centric focus, progressive growth, and innovative technologies.

Joseph Abajian (DJ Jab) founded Fat Beats in 1994 with nothing more than a shoestring budget and an earnest obsession with the music, the culture, and the brotherhood of New York’s burgeoning rap scene. What began as a simple vinyl shop in Manhattan’s Lower East Side quickly became an integral hub for artists, both aspiring and established, to convene and collaborate on new projects. Joseph’s timing couldn’t have been more impeccable. When the 90’s cultural zeitgeist – and, in turn, the music industry establishment – chose hip-hop as its new arbiter of cool.International tourists and touring artists alike flocked to Fat Beats for rare vinyl, kindred spirits, and exclusive in-store performances from Jay Z, Eminem, Gang Starr, Outkast, Slum Village, Mos Def, and more. One thing was clear: the Fat Beats phenomenon could no longer be contained in a single basement shop.In the late nineties, Abajian proceeded to open new stores in Amsterdam, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. He further expanded the company’s profile to include global distribution and record label branches. Distribution has since proven to be the company’s strongest and most enduring enterprise. Today Fat Beats Distribution stands poised as one of the country’s pre-eminent distributors of vinyl & specialty item records: a proud survivor in an industry now famous for its mortality rate. Despite market fluctuations, technology innovations, and stylistic revolutions, Fat Beats has remained steadfast in its commitment to the timeless vinyl format and to the loyal community who keeps it spinning.

Check out our guide to storage unit environments, and find the right one for the items you'll store.

 Home  Storage Facilities  Moving Boxes & Supplies

Moving Boxes & Supplies 
You'll need a few of these! Life Storage has a complete line of tough, mover-grade moving boxes and packing supplies at our self storage facilities.







 Small Moving Box 

For packing books, CDs, DVDs, photos and other small items. 
For fragile keepsakes – be sure to wrap properly and handle with extreme care. 
Be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.


DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 16 x 12.5 x 12.5
– Easy to lift with side handles
– One 60-yard roll of tape will accommodate about 12 - 14 small boxes





 Medium Moving Box 

Our most versatile moving box for a variety of items
For kitchen and household belongings, office items, framed photos and more
Be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.


DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 18 x 18 x 16
– Easy to lift with side handles
– One 60-yard roll of tape will accommodate about 10 - 12 medium boxes





 Large Moving Box 

For large lightweight items such as toys, linens, towels, etc.
Wrap smaller, heavier items in towels or linens in these large boxes.
Especially important – be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.


DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 24 x 18 x 18
– Easy to lift with side handles
– One 60-yard roll of tape will accommodate about 8 - 10 large boxes

DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 24 x 18 x 24

 Wardrobe Box

45 inches tall for clothing on hangers
Hanging bar makes it easy to move clothes right from the closet to the wardrobe box
Great for storing clothes at home during changing seasons

DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 24 x 20 x 45




 Packing Tape
Before you select your boxes, note that you will need packing tape to put them together. Packing tape is available in different size rolls – we recommend the larger of the two rolls because the difference in price is very little and you will likely use all the tape.
One 60-yard roll will tape:

12 - 14 small boxes
10 - 12 medium boxes
8 - 10 large or extra large boxes






Tip: Tape like a pro
Review the following recommended taping method to help ensure secure seams while helping to prevent crushing:


1. Fold in the shorter flaps first
2. Fold in long flaps and secure with three strips of tape down the center
3. Place two final strips perpendicular about three inches from the box edge






 Tip: Dishes and Fragile Items
Be sure to wrap your dishes and fragile items carefully to protect them during moving and storage. We have everything you need including:

Bubble Pack – Superior protection for fragile items
Dish Packs and Glass Packs
Newsprint wrapping paper
Labels for marking boxes







 Tip: Choosing the Right Boxes
When packing boxes for storage, do not use boxes from supermarkets, liquor stores or other food and beverage retail outlets. Food odors remain in the cardboard and can attract pests and rodents into the storage space. We want to do everything we can to protect your belongings and those of your storage neighbors.
As boxes age, they become weaker in the walls.  Be sure that your boxes are strong and can stand up to the pressure of stacking one on top of another.  During your move and during storage, boxes that collapse can make a terrible mess!





Moving Boxes and Packing Supplies Guide 
Packing up your home means you need more than just a few boxes; you'll need tape, bubble pack, and newsprint, as well. To ensure you have all the packing supplies you need, consider purchasing moving supplies from Life Storage, using the charts below as reference.
