Betty R. Johnson





Betty R. Johnson passed away Tuesday, March 25, 2014, at the age of 88 in her home at Emeritus Senior Living in Rockford, Illinois. She was born on March 19, 1926, in Osceola, Iowa, the second of two daughters of Oscar and Mamie (McKnight) Marquis. She grew up on a farm in Osceola, Iowa, and later moved with her parents her junior year of high school to a farm outside Chariton, Iowa. She graduated from Chariton High School with the class of 1944.

After high school she worked at Crozier’s Store where she met Edwin Johnson. They were married at her parent’s home on Sept. 10, 1947, by Reverend Archie Beals and moved to a farm outside of Russell, Iowa. They farmed for over 30 years and were blessed with two children--daughter Martha and son Duane. They retired and moved to Chariton, Iowa, in 1984 but faithfully attended First Baptist Church of Russell throughout their married life. Betty was widowed in September 2002 and moved to Rockford in July of 2011 to be near her daughter and son-in-law.
Betty is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Duane and Brenda Johnson of Ankeny, Iowa; grandson and wife, Alex and Sadie Johnson of Omaha, Neb.; granddaughter Jenna Johnson of Ankeny, Iowa; daughter and son-in-law Martha and Don Johnson of Belvidere, Illinois.
Betty was preceded in death by her parents, husband Edwin, and sister Glida Marquis Palmer.
Services were held Saturday, March 29 at 10:30 am at the Fielding Funeral home with Pastor Russell Harris officiating. Visitation took place one hour prior to services. Interment was in the Chariton Cemetery.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
