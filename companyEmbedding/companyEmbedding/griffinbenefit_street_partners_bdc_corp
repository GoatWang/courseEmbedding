THIS NOTICE REQUIRES YOU TO CONFIRM CERTAIN MATTERS (INCLUDING THAT YOU ARE NOT RESIDENT IN SUCH A JURISDICTION), BEFORE YOU MAY OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION IS NOT DIRECTED AT, AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY, PERSONS RESIDENT IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF THAT JURISDICTION.
THIS SECTION OF THE WEBSITE CONTAINS ANNOUNCEMENTS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION (THE "INFORMATION") PUBLISHED BY BIDCO AND/OR CHIME RELATING TO THE OFFER IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY CODE ON TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS (THE "CODE"). THE INFORMATION IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE IN GOOD FAITH AND FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, AND ITS AVAILABILITY IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET OUT BELOW.
THE OFFER CANNOT BE VALIDLY ACCEPTED BY THE CHIME SHAREHOLDERS OR ANY OTHER PERSONS BY MEANS OF DOWNLOADING A COPY OF THE OFFER DOCUMENTS FROM THIS WEBSITE.
Access to the Information
Please read this notice carefully - it applies to all persons who view this part of the website and, depending upon who you are and where you live, it may affect your rights. This notice and the information contained herein may be altered or updated from time to time, and should be read in full carefully each time you visit this part of the website.
Overseas Persons
The information contained herein is not for publication or distribution, directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would violate the law of that jurisdiction (a "Restricted Jurisdiction"), and the availability of the Information (and any related offer) to shareholders of Chime who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be affected by the laws of relevant jurisdictions. Persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable regulatory and legal requirements.
If you are not permitted to view the Information on this website, or viewing the Information would result in a breach of the above, or you are in any doubt as to whether you are permitted to view the Information, please exit this web page.
Additional US information
The Offer relates to the shares of a UK company and will be subject to UK procedural and disclosure requirements that are different from those of the United States. Any financial statements or other financial information included in this section of the website may have been prepared in accordance with non-US accounting standards that may not be comparable to the financial statements of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It may be difficult for US holders of shares in Chime to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the US federal securities laws in connection with the Offer, since each of Chime and Bidco is located in a country other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. US holders of shares in Chime may not be able to sue Chime, Bidco or their respective officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel Chime, Bidco and their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a US court.
Forward-looking statements
The information (including information incorporated by reference) and documents in this section of the website may contain forward-looking statements regarding Chime's and/or Bidco's  financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in any document may be forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements also often use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "intend", "estimate", "expect" and words of similar meaning. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. The important factors that could cause Chime's and/or Bidco's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer, regulatory approvals that may require acceptance of conditions with potential adverse impacts and general economic conditions.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the respective documents. Chime and Bidco each expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement (except to the extent legally required).
Unless expressly stated otherwise, no statement contained or referred to in this section of the website is intended to be a profit forecast.

Overview & Strategy

Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC (“GB-BDC”) is a non-traded business development company (“BDC”) that primarily invests in senior debt securities issued by U.S. middle market companies. GB-BDC’s lending strategy is focused on creditworthy, well managed companies with predictable cash flows, many of whom are in the media and communications industries where Benefit Street Partners and their parent company Providence Equity Partners, have longstanding relationships and industry expertise. With a single investment in GB-BDC, individual investors gain access to institutional-quality, credit-oriented investments and have the opportunity for both current income and capital appreciation, with a measure of protection against inflation in a rising interest rate environment.

in secured debt and unsecured debt as well as equity and equity related securities issued by private U.S. companies primarily in the middle market, as well as public U.S. companies with market equity capitalization of less than $250 million,
with a strong focus on credit quality, including a high level of investment discipline and selectivity,
originating its debt investments by leveraging Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.’s and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C.’s nationwide networks of relationships, including those in the media and communications industries, and
in transactions where GB-BDC is able to participate in return enhancement features such as original issue discount (OID), payment in kind (PIK), call protection and warrants designed to enhance returns above the coupon of the loans.

current income,
portfolio diversification,
and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation.

Mar 17 2016
Griffin Terminates BDC, Cites Changing Regulatory and Market Conditions
Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC Corp., a publicly registered non-traded business development company, is actively exploring strategic options for the company. 
  Citing a changing regulatory environment, structural challenges, as well as market and yield dynamics associated with operating a non-traded BDC, Griffin-Benefit Street Partners’ board of directors voted to cease the current offering effective March 15, 2016. 
  Griffin Capital will work with the board to explore strategic options for the BDC that are “in keeping with the best interests of the shareholders.” In that regard, Griffin Capital is working to expand the Griffin Institutional Access family of investment products to build upon the success of Griffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund (GIREX). Among other initiatives, Griffin intends to develop a global credit oriented interval fund that will complement and expand upon the investment mandate of the BDC.





  During an exclusive interview with The DI Wire, Griffin Capital CEO Kevin Shields explained the upside of possibly merging the company into an interval fund structure, upon shareholder approval.
  “The non-traded BDC market is coming under increasing regulatory pressure between FINRA NTM 15-02, the proposed DOL fiduciary rule and NASAA’s asset concentration limitation – the confluence of which will deteriorate industry BDC sales. The BDC structure is limited in its investment mandate, and given most all non-traded BDCs invest at the top end of the capital stack, it is difficult to overcome the high front end load. By contrast, the interval fund structure allows for a broad pallet of investment alternatives, has lower up-front fees, lower ongoing fees, and given our exemptive relief, can offer multiple share classes to fit the needs of the advisors and their clients. Further, the interval fund is not hampered by the regulatory headwind facing the non-traded BDC space.”
  He added, “Whereas making this type of structural shift mid-offering is difficult to accomplish and may cause short-term market confusion, we are firm in our resolve that the lower fee proposition of the interval fund, coupled with the increased breadth of debt alternatives in which the fund can invest, will drive enhanced shareholder returns and improve their overall experience. In the end, this is about doing the right thing for our investors.”
  The motivation for the BDC’s strategic structural shift includes a number of factors. According to Shields:
  Non-traded BDC sponsors focus on originating and/or acquiring senior secured and senior debt of private corporations or public corporations with a market equity capitalization of less than $250 million – this narrow bandwidth restricts efficient capital deployment and allocation in a fluid and dynamic credit market.
  High offering fees, particularly for a debt platform, have to compress to enhance an investor’s positive economic experience.
  A positive investor outcome is further challenged given the propensity of the public BDC market to trade at a discount to net asset value, which recently exceeded 20 percent.
  A non-traded BDC illiquidity premium is illogical to the extent an investor can acquire, in the current market environment, a liquid, traded BDC with a demonstrably higher current return.
  Shields indicated that, “In Griffin Capital’s opinion, the interval fund structure offers a number of potential advantages to investors over the business development company structure including:”
  Greater net asset value transparency with daily pricing frequency.
  Enhanced liquidity - interval funds are required to offer shareholders periodic redemptions of at least 5 percent of the fund’s outstanding shares, typically on a quarterly basis.
  Wider range of investment opportunities – BDCs, unlike interval funds, must have at least 70 percent of their assets invested in specific types of issuers.
  Lower fees – unlike BDCs, interval funds generally are prohibited from charging investors an incentive fee.
  Shields continued: “Benefit Street Partners is an important relationship to us and their involvement is critical to achieve ongoing success. We could not be more pleased that we have the full support of Benefit Street to engage in this strategic shift. Further, we look forward to sharing information with the market in the near term regarding both our plans for [the BDC] and our exciting product development initiatives.”
  Griffin Capital BDC Advisor is an indirect subsidiary of Griffin Capital Corporation and serves as the investment adviser to Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC. The advisor is primarily responsible for managing all day-to-day operations and providing investment advisory and management services to GB-BDC, including reviewing and approving investments. 
  Griffin Capital and affiliates, through the end of 2015, owned, managed, sponsored and/or co-sponsored an institutional-quality portfolio of commercial real estate located in the United States and United Kingdom, representing approximately $6.7 billion in asset value.

LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, March  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC Corp. (“GB-BDC”) has determined it is in the best interest of GB-BDC and its stockholders to suspend the continuous public offering of GB-BDC’s common stock (the “Offering”) under its prospectus, dated December 10, 2015.  The Board’s determination was based on Griffin Capital BDC Advisor, LLC’s (the “Advisor”) belief that market conditions and GB-BDC’s current structure are not conducive to continuing the Offering.  The Adviser has proposed to the Board that GB-BDC elect an alternative fund structure that is expected to reduce the GB-BDC’s exposure to potential federal and state regulatory challenges and unfavorable market conditions facing non-traded BDCs.  Such alternative structures include an interval fund structure through which the GB-BDC may be allowed to consummate investments generally not otherwise available to BDCs.  The Board has not made a decision to pursue any specific alternative structure.  Any determination to alter the structure of GB-BDC would be subject to both Board and stockholder approval. GB-BDC will continue to operate as a non-traded BDC unless and until both the Board and stockholders approve an alternative structure. The suspension of GB-BDC’s Offering is effective March 15, 2016.  GB-BDC has requested its exclusive dealer manager, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, to inform its network of broker-dealers, financial advisors, and affiliated selling groups that GB-BDC has suspended the Offering.  The transfer agent for GB-BDC will not accept subscriptions received on or after March 15, 2016.  GB-BDC will cancel and issue refunds for all subscriptions received on or after March 4, 2016.  GB-BDC will also send written notification to its stockholders that it is suspending its distribution reinvestment plan, effective March 15, 2016.  Kevin Shields, Chairman and CEO of Griffin Capital Corporation, the sponsor of the Offering, and Chairman and President of GB-BDC, commented: “After extensive internal deliberation, including discussions with our valued sub-adviser Benefit Street Partners, and discussions with the Board, we collectively concluded it is in the best interests of our stockholders to reevaluate the BDC structure and consider alternative structures to broaden our investment mandate and enhance overall financial performance.  Contemporaneous hereto, Griffin Capital Corporation has issued its own press release addressing both its concerns and structural considerations.  We look forward to sharing information with the market in the near term regarding both our plans for the GB-BDC and our exciting product development initiatives.” About Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC (“GB-BDC”) is a publicly registered non-traded business development company that has elected to be regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and intends to invest primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as equity and equity related securities issued by private U.S. companies primarily in the middle market or public U.S. companies with market equity capitalization of less than $250 million.
