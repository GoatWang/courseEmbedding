	Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.





	On May 6, 2013, Capital Senior Living Corporation (the Company) announced its financial results for the first quarter
	ended March 31, 2013 by issuing a press release. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.




	The information being furnished under Item 2.02, Item 7.01, Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
	(the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. The press release and the
	presentation referenced below contain, and may implicate, forward-looking statements regarding the Company and include cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.




	In the press release and the presentation referenced below, the Companys management utilized non-GAAP financial
	measures to describe the Companys adjusted EBITDAR, adjusted EBITDAR margin, adjusted CFFO, adjusted CFFO per share and other items. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate financial performance and resource
	allocation for its facilities and for the Company as a whole. These measures are commonly used as an analytical indicator within the senior housing industry, and also serve as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. The Company has
	provided this information in order to enhance investors overall understanding of the Companys financial performance and prospects. In addition, because the Company has historically provided this type of information to the investment community,
	the Company believes that including this information provides consistency in its financial reporting.




	These non-GAAP
	financial measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from them are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. These
	measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operating, investing, or financing activities, earnings per share or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial
	statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. Because these measures are not measurements determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, these measures as
	presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.











	Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.





	Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 is an updated slideshow presentation of the Company.




	By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company does not acknowledge that disclosure of this information is required by Regulation
	FD or that the information was material or non-public before the disclosure. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements in this presentation that become untrue because of new information, subsequent events
	or otherwise.

	REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2013 RESULTS;






	CFFO INCREASES 45% VERSUS PRIOR YEAR





	DALLAS  (BUSINESS WIRE)  May 6,
	2013  Capital Senior Living Corporation (the Company) (NYSE:CSU), one of the countrys largest operators of senior living communities, today announced operating results for the first quarter of 2013. Company highlights for the
	first quarter include:






	Highlights





	 





	 




	




	 





	Adjusted Cash From Facility Operations (CFFO) increased 44.9% to $9.7 million, or $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2013, an increase

	Adjusted EBITDAR increased 18.5% to $30.5 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2012. EBITDAR
	margin was 35.3% in the first quarter of 2013.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Revenue increased 19.4% to $86.2 million in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $14.0 million from the first quarter of 2012.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Average monthly rent for the consolidated communities increased 2.7% to $3,022 per occupied unit in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $80 per

	We are very pleased to report continued strong results for the first quarter, which is typically a
	challenging period, said Lawrence A. Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Excellent expense management has yielded significant growth in net operating income despite the effects of normal seasonality and an active and prolonged
	flu season. First quarter same-community occupancies increased 70 basis points from the comparable quarter of the prior year and CFFO grew by approximately 45%. Recent trends indicate solid growth in occupancy in the second quarter. Our robust
	pipeline allows us to continue our disciplined and strategic acquisition program that increases our ownership of high-quality senior living communities in geographically concentrated regions and generates meaningful increases in CFFO, earnings and
	real estate value. We differentiate Capital Senior Living as the value leader in providing quality seniors housing and care at reasonable prices. We are well positioned to make meaningful gains in shareholder value as a substantially all private-pay
	business in an industry that benefits from need-driven demand, limited new supply, and an improving economy and housing market.

	Financial Results






	For the first quarter of 2013, the Company reported revenue of $86.2 million, compared to revenue of $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2012. Resident and healthcare revenue increased from the first
	quarter of the prior year by approximately $13.8 million, or 19.4%, largely as a result of acquiring 12 communities since the first quarter of 2012. The number of consolidated communities increased from 87 in the first quarter of 2012 to 99 in the
	first quarter of 2013.




	Average monthly rent for the consolidated communities was $3,022 per occupied unit in the first quarter of 2013, an
	increase of $80, or 2.7%, over the first quarter of 2012. Financial occupancy of the consolidated portfolio averaged 86.7% in the first quarter of 2013, 100 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2012.




	As a percentage of resident and healthcare revenue, operating expenses were 59.1% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to 59.8% in the first quarter of
	2012, an improvement of 70 basis points. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2013 were $50.1 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to 12 additional communities now being consolidated.




	General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues under management were 5.1% for the quarter, excluding transaction costs of approximately
	$0.4 million. Expenses this quarter were impacted by an abnormally high level of medical claims. The Company is self-insured for the costs of employee and dependent medical benefits and purchases stop-loss protection on an individual and aggregate
	basis. This self-insurance program significantly reduces the Companys health insurance costs. Occasionally, expenses are higher than average in a particular quarter as a few claims approach stop-loss insurance thresholds. Health care costs in
	the first quarter of 2013 exceeded the first quarter of 2012 by approximately $0.5 million.




	Adjusted EBITDAR for the first quarter of 2013
	was approximately $30.5 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 18.5% from the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 35.3% for the period.




	Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2013 was $1.8 million, or $0.07 per share, excluding non-recurring or non-economic items reconciled on the final page of this release. This equals adjusted net
	income of $0.07 per share in the first quarter of 2012.




	Adjusted CFFO was $9.7 million or $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2013.
	Adjusted CFFO exceeded the first quarter of 2012 by $3.0 million, or $0.10 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company initiated a tax consulting engagement to assist in reviewing the classification of costs incurred for the purchase of
	owned assets and improvements to its leased portfolio. The purpose of this study was to determine which costs may qualify for shorter depreciable lives for federal income tax purposes.







	CAPITAL/Page

	Approximately $0.09 per share of CFFO was realized in the fourth quarter of 2012, with an additional
	$0.20 per share of CFFO anticipated to be realized in 2013. The CFFO in 2013 is expected to result from tax savings of $5.5 million that will be recognized as nearly $15.0 million of taxable income is offset by this additional depreciation, of which
	the Company realized a benefit of approximately $0.6 million, or $0.02 per share, in the first quarter of 2013.






	Operating Activities






	At communities under management, excluding one community that had a recent conversion, same-community revenue in the first quarter of
	2013 increased 3.1% versus the first quarter of 2012. Same-community expenses increased 0.9% and net operating income increased 6.4% from the first quarter of the prior year.




	Same-community occupancies were 70 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2012 and 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. Average rents were 2.1% higher than the first quarter of
	2012 and 0.6% higher than last quarter. While the first quarter is typically a challenging period, positive trends in the second quarter indicate that occupancies are improving quickly.




	Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2013 were approximately $2.1 million, representing $1.1 million of investment spending and $1.0 million of recurring capital expenditures. If annualized,
	spending for recurring capital expenditures equaled approximately $400 per unit.






	Balance Sheet






	The Company ended the first quarter of 2013 with $27.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. As of March 31, 2013, the
	Company financed its 49 owned communities with mortgages totaling $364.0 million at fixed interest rates averaging 5.2%. During the first quarter, the Company refinanced a bridge loan associated with a 2012 acquisition with permanent financing. The
	Company has no mortgage maturities before the third quarter of 2015.






	Q1 2013 Conference Call Information






	The Company will host a conference call with senior management to discuss the Companys first quarter 2013 financial results. The call will be held
	on Tuesday, May 7, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The call-in number is 913-312-0653, confirmation code 6058447. A link to a simultaneous webcast of the teleconference will be available at
