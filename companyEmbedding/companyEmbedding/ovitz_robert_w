Rex Energy Corp. said it had promoted Robert W. Ovitz to chief operating officer of the State College-based natural gas drilling company.
Ovitz will replace Patrick McKinney, who has been president and COO since October 2011. McKinney is leaving the company for the investment banking industry. CEO Tom Stabley will add president to his job responsibilities once McKinney leaves in August.




 


Ovitz had been senior vice president, operations, for Rex. He’ll be in charge of the entire company’s operations, which include Appalachian and Illinois drilling.





“Bob Ovitz is a proven leader with an exemplary track record in our industry," Stabley said in a statement. "He is a seasoned oil and gas executive with decades of operational experience at leading E&P companies and in the Appalachian Basin. Since joining Rex Energy, his leadership has positively impacted all aspects of our operations.”

Paul J. Gough is digital producer at the Pittsburgh Business Times, handles social media, and writes about breaking news. Contact him at pgough@bizjournals.com or 412-208-3827. You can also follow him on Twitter.
