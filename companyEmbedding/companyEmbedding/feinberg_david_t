Geisinger Health System, Known for Innovations, Names UCLA Health President as Chief

Geisinger Health System, which is viewed as a national model in providing both high-quality and cost-effective medical care, announced on Monday that it had chosen Dr. David T. Feinberg, the president of the UCLA Health System, as its next chief executive.Hospitals and doctors are struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, where employers and insurers are increasingly rewarding them for the value of the care they deliver rather that the amount of care they provide. Dr. Feinberg is expected to bring a strong emphasis on providing a positive patient experience, increasingly viewed as an important part of care.Geisinger has been at the forefront of adopting new ways to deliver care. The system is one of only a handful of organizations, along with Kaiser Permanente in California and Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, to closely coordinate the care of patients, improve their health and reduce overall medical costs, through the full integration of an insurance plan with hospitals and physician practices.Geisinger offers a “perfect laboratory, or sweet spot, to make those things work,” Dr. Feinberg said.

The system, which has nine hospitals and 1,200 physicians, is well known for such innovations as the so-called warranty for coronary bypass surgeries, promising employers and insurers that it could reduce complications and avoid hospital readmissions by having its doctors follow a specific protocol of care. The system, through its insurer, has also invested in helping doctors better manage the care of their patients by helping pay for nurses to oversee that care. Continue reading the main story

Geisinger has recently expanded beyond Pennsylvania to announce plans to buy AtlantiCare, a health system in southern New Jersey. Geisinger is also active in medical research in areas like genomic medicine.Dr. Feinberg, a 52-year-old psychiatrist who has spent virtually all of his career at UCLA, is expected to take over Geisinger, which has headquarters in Danville in northeastern Pennsylvania, on May 1. He replaces the nonprofit system’s longtime chief executive, Dr. Glenn D. Steele Jr., 70. Dr. Steele will remain chairman of a for-profit venture the system spun off in 2013.In choosing Dr. Feinberg, Geisinger picked someone who made UCLA much more popular with its patients. For the last several years, Dr. Feinberg ran the four hospitals and faculty practice of the Los Angeles health system affiliated with the University of California, including the system’s flagship hospital, Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, one of the nation’s top academic medical centers.

While the system is well respected for its sophisticated medical care, it has also been criticized for its high costs. Dr. Feinberg tackled both the system’s expenses and its reputation for poor patient service.“Our laser focus was on patient satisfaction, defining it as a true north,” Dr. Feinberg said. Too often, he said, doctors and nurses forget the importance of being present with the patient, he said, especially as medical care is more reliant on new technology. At UCLA, patient satisfaction scores rose sharply.“There are so many distractions,” Dr. Feinberg said. “The true north has to be, in the middle of a crazy payment system and all of these changes, how to care for the person,” he said, whether someone is arriving by helicopter for emergency medical care or is a new mother with various social and psychological challenges. “My leadership style is at the bedside.”

One of his hopes, Dr. Feinberg said, is to bring some of the same thinking about patient experience to Geisinger’s health insurance unit. He wants to rethink the relationship the insurer has with its members and focus more on meeting needs in new ways.William Alexander, the chairman of the Geisinger Health System Foundation, said the board believed that Dr. Feinberg would be able to navigate through the rapid changes in health care through his focus on quality care and patient satisfaction. “He will be able to present a vision and make us a significant contributor to the industry,” he said.

Geisinger would not disclose at the time of the announcement how much it planned to pay Dr. Feinberg as chief executive.The UCLA medical center was recently the site of a lethal “superbug,” transmitted through improperly sterilized medical scopes, that caused seven patients to fall ill, including two who died. While UCLA said it had followed the manufacturers’ guidelines, Dr. Feinberg was quick to apologize and acknowledge the need for people to understand what was happening.“I’ve had the experience in being involved in a variety of crises at UCLA,” said Dr. Feinberg, who added, “Apologizing and being transparent is crucial.”At Geisinger, Dr. Feinberg said he planned to spend the next several months learning more about the organization and spending as much time as he could with patients. At his interview, for example, he asked to speak to patients as way of better understanding their care.“It’s a great way to see how the system is working,” he said. “It’s really, really key to walk the shop floor.”

 Correction: February 25, 2015  
An article on Tuesday about the appointment of Dr. David T. Feinberg, now president of the UCLA Health System, as chief executive of the Geisinger Health System misstated his tenure at UCLA. He has spent virtually all of his career there, not roughly half.

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Born in Lynn, Massachusetts to Jewish parents, Feinberg grew up in Syracuse, New York. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in mathematics and studying creative writing with novelist John Hersey, graduating in 1977.[1] He subsequently worked as a computer programmer for the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) and also pursued a Master's degree in linguistics at New York University.[1] He completed his first novel, Calculus, in 1979, although it has never been published. Feinberg himself described the novel as "godawful", telling one interviewer that it was a novel that "only an MIT math major could have written".[1]
In the early 1980s, he joined a gay men's writing group, eventually creating the character B. J. Rosenthal, a young gay Jewish man, much like Feinberg himself who became the central character in virtually all of Feinberg's later writing. He contributed a humour column to the gay magazine Mandate in 1986 and 1987, which in turn led to his first book deal. The novel Eighty-Sixed was published in 1989,[2] and won Feinberg the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Fiction and the American Library Association Gay/Lesbian Award for Fiction.
Feinberg tested positive for HIV in 1987, and joined the activist organization ACT UP.[3] He participated in ACT UP demonstrations including Stop the Church.[3] In 1991, he published his second novel, a sequel to Eighty-Sixed entitled Spontaneous Combustion, a selection of both the Book of the Month Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club. For the next few years, Feinberg balanced writing and political activism with working full-time. Stories, articles, and reviews by him appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The Advocate, Details, OutWeek, Tribe, NYQ, QW, Out, The Body Positive, Gay Community News, Art & Understanding, The James White Review, Diseased Pariah News, Poz, and both Men on Men 2: Best New Gay Fiction and Men on Men 4.
Death[edit]
In July 1994, failing health led him to take disability leave. That fall, he was admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan, which was, until it closed, the flagship hospital of the St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers located in Greenwich Village, where he died early in November at the age of 37. Even while hospitalized, he continued to write. His final book, a collection of essays called Queer and Loathing: Rants and Raves of a Raging AIDS Clone, was published shortly before his death.[4]
Body of work[edit]
B. J. Rosenthal, the main character of Feinberg's first two published books and a wise-mouthed, perpetually libidinous urbanite, was something of an alter ego for his creator. "He and I aren't the same person exactly," Feinberg told New York Newsday in 1992. "I'd say he's 60 to 70 percent me. We're both gay, of course, and HIV-positive. But...I write novels, and he doesn't. And while he's more well-endowed, I'm a better lover."[5]
Queer and Loathing, by contrast, was "as close to the truth as I can get," as Feinberg wrote in the book's introduction. The essays were his attempt "to capture what is to me a painfully obvious reality that is rarely written about: what it is like to be HIV-positive in the 90s; what it is like to outlive one therapist, two dentists, two doctors, and one gastroenterologist."
"He exemplified the best of the gay humor we use to endure impossible situations," said Ed Iwanicki, Feinberg's editor at Viking Penguin. "No one was able to find that humor in the most dire situations as well as he was."[6]
"It was so biting and so satirical, and it had a very New York edge," said author Jameson Currier, who knew Feinberg as a fellow member of ACT UP. "He was the first to write in that style about AIDS, and he created quite a bit of controversy. He broke a lot of ground in that respect."[6]
Legacy and influence[edit]
Feinberg's voice reading from Queer and Loathing was used in the 1995 PBS series Positive: Life with HIV in 1995.[7]
Feinberg's papers are held by the New York Public Library's Manuscripts and Archives Division.[1]
Reviewers suggest that the character Zach in John Weir's 2006 novel What I Did Wrong is based on Feinberg, who was a friend of Weir.[8][9]
He is mentioned by several interviewees of the ACT UP Oral History Project.[10]
The poem, "The Square Root of Three" is recited by Kumar Patel, in order to reconnect with Vanessa Fanning during the final confrontation of the comedic film Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, is often mistakenly attributed to him. The poem instead was written by a Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor also named David Feinberg.

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Born in Lynn, Massachusetts to Jewish parents, Feinberg grew up in Syracuse, New York. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in mathematics and studying creative writing with novelist John Hersey, graduating in 1977.[1] He subsequently worked as a computer programmer for the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) and also pursued a Master's degree in linguistics at New York University.[1] He completed his first novel, Calculus, in 1979, although it has never been published. Feinberg himself described the novel as "godawful", telling one interviewer that it was a novel that "only an MIT math major could have written".[1]
In the early 1980s, he joined a gay men's writing group, eventually creating the character B. J. Rosenthal, a young gay Jewish man, much like Feinberg himself who became the central character in virtually all of Feinberg's later writing. He contributed a humour column to the gay magazine Mandate in 1986 and 1987, which in turn led to his first book deal. The novel Eighty-Sixed was published in 1989,[2] and won Feinberg the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Men's Fiction and the American Library Association Gay/Lesbian Award for Fiction.
Feinberg tested positive for HIV in 1987, and joined the activist organization ACT UP.[3] He participated in ACT UP demonstrations including Stop the Church.[3] In 1991, he published his second novel, a sequel to Eighty-Sixed entitled Spontaneous Combustion, a selection of both the Book of the Month Club and the Quality Paperback Book Club. For the next few years, Feinberg balanced writing and political activism with working full-time. Stories, articles, and reviews by him appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The Advocate, Details, OutWeek, Tribe, NYQ, QW, Out, The Body Positive, Gay Community News, Art & Understanding, The James White Review, Diseased Pariah News, Poz, and both Men on Men 2: Best New Gay Fiction and Men on Men 4.
Death[edit]
In July 1994, failing health led him to take disability leave. That fall, he was admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan, which was, until it closed, the flagship hospital of the St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers located in Greenwich Village, where he died early in November at the age of 37. Even while hospitalized, he continued to write. His final book, a collection of essays called Queer and Loathing: Rants and Raves of a Raging AIDS Clone, was published shortly before his death.[4]
Body of work[edit]
B. J. Rosenthal, the main character of Feinberg's first two published books and a wise-mouthed, perpetually libidinous urbanite, was something of an alter ego for his creator. "He and I aren't the same person exactly," Feinberg told New York Newsday in 1992. "I'd say he's 60 to 70 percent me. We're both gay, of course, and HIV-positive. But...I write novels, and he doesn't. And while he's more well-endowed, I'm a better lover."[5]
Queer and Loathing, by contrast, was "as close to the truth as I can get," as Feinberg wrote in the book's introduction. The essays were his attempt "to capture what is to me a painfully obvious reality that is rarely written about: what it is like to be HIV-positive in the 90s; what it is like to outlive one therapist, two dentists, two doctors, and one gastroenterologist."
"He exemplified the best of the gay humor we use to endure impossible situations," said Ed Iwanicki, Feinberg's editor at Viking Penguin. "No one was able to find that humor in the most dire situations as well as he was."[6]
"It was so biting and so satirical, and it had a very New York edge," said author Jameson Currier, who knew Feinberg as a fellow member of ACT UP. "He was the first to write in that style about AIDS, and he created quite a bit of controversy. He broke a lot of ground in that respect."[6]
Legacy and influence[edit]
Feinberg's voice reading from Queer and Loathing was used in the 1995 PBS series Positive: Life with HIV in 1995.[7]
Feinberg's papers are held by the New York Public Library's Manuscripts and Archives Division.[1]
Reviewers suggest that the character Zach in John Weir's 2006 novel What I Did Wrong is based on Feinberg, who was a friend of Weir.[8][9]
He is mentioned by several interviewees of the ACT UP Oral History Project.[10]
The poem, "The Square Root of Three" is recited by Kumar Patel, in order to reconnect with Vanessa Fanning during the final confrontation of the comedic film Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, is often mistakenly attributed to him. The poem instead was written by a Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor also named David Feinberg.

		10 things to know about Geisinger's new CEO: Dr. David Feinberg



		Written by Molly Gamble and Tamara Rosin |

David Feinberg, MD, former UCLA Hospital System CEO, was appointed to take the top seat at Danville, Pa.-based Geisinger Health System on Monday. A hands-on clinician leader, Dr. Feinberg says after studying Geisinger for the last six years, he cannot be more excited for the new role.
Here are 10 things to know about Dr. Feinberg.
1. Dr. Feinberg, 53, assumed his post as CEO of UCLA Hospital System in 2007. He will begin his tenure as Geisinger's sixth CEO on May 1, replacing Glenn Steele, MD, PhD. Dr. Steele has led the system since 2001.
2. Dr. Feinberg is triple board-certified in child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and addiction psychiatry. His areas of clinical expertise include attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and adolescent substance abuse. He plans to continue seeing patients at Geisinger.
3. Dr. Feinberg's leadership style is distinct in that he makes an effort to remain accessible to patients, even sharing his business card and cell phone number. "When I got this job, I went into patient rooms because I was really scared," he told Becker's Hospital Review in 2011. "There was a lot about running a large academic medical center that I didn't know. I spent time with patients to decrease my anxiety — it was something I knew how to do. Now I visit patients because it's the most fun part of the job."
4. Dr. Feinberg admits traditional ways new leaders meet their new staff and fit into the culture aren't his style. "I like to get to know the people on the frontlines. You can find me in the kitchen talking to the cooking staff and nutritionists or in the halls with the nurses," he says. According to Dr. Feinberg, the most valuable tool a leader has is his ears, and the best way to learn about a new organization is to listen to the people providing the care.
5. When he assumed his role at UCLA, two out of three patients would not refer the system to a friend. Patient satisfaction scores grew from the 38th to 99th percentile under Dr. Feinberg's tenure, but he expressed the need for further improvement. "I'm the most critical of all — 99th percentile patient satisfaction sucks," he told Becker's. "That puts us in 99th percentile among hospitals, so 85 out of 100 patients would recommend us to family or friends. All that means to me is that we have failed miserably with 15 patients and families. And I wanted those patients treated like my family. I'm critical of myself everyday. We can't ever mess up. We need 100 out of 100 patients to be satisfied, and it has to stay that way. This 99th percentile is terrible, but it's much better than where we started."
6. Dr. Feinberg earned his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated with distinction from the Chicago Medical School and completed an internship in pediatrics at Loyola University Medical Center and residency and fellowship training in psychiatry and child psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine. Dr. Feinberg earned his MBA from Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif.
7. Geisinger is known for its physician-led structure and innovations to improve patient care and access. UCLA Health System has and continues to deliver a range of innovations, bolstered by its Institute for Innovation in Health. "There are a lot of paths into our innovation center. Some ideas come from those working directly in innovation. They might have a brand new idea or they might have seen something somewhere else that might make sense [at UCLA], so they bring it into the council," Dr. Feinberg told Becker's in 2013. "Or it could come from anyone in the workforce. We try to really be out there, looking for ideas from the frontline."
8. Dr. Feinberg is insistent that innovation does not always mean reinventing the wheel. In 2013, the system standardized a common greeting to incoming phone calls: This is UCLA Health. Would you like to be seen today? "Cleveland Clinic has been [answering phones] this way for years," Dr. Feinberg said on a phone call. "We want to make that model [specific to UCLA] but also say, 'Hey look, we're humble. We didn't come up with this on our own.'"
9. Dr. Feinberg gave a Tedx Talk in 2011 about the patient experience and his singular focus on the patient. Illustrated with personal vignettes, Dr. Feinberg discusses the opportunity for improving the quality of healthcare simply by increasing focus on the patient experience.
10. Dr. Feinberg welcomes the move to Pennsylvania — despite the arctic cold the East is experiencing. His wife Andrea, also a physician, is originally from New York. Both of their children currently live on the East Coast, with one living in New York and the other attending the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Leadership & Management






		The corner office: Dr. David Feinberg on raising the patient experience to a whole new level



		Written by Tamara Rosin (Twitter | Google+)  |
	

		December 07, 2015 |
	
Print |
Email












David T. Feinberg, MD, was named president and CEO of Geisinger in February 2015. In the almost year since he took over leadership of Geisinger from Glenn Steele, MD, PhD, Dr. Feinberg has redefined what customer service looks like in healthcare. In an unprecedented move, he spearheaded the evolution of the healthcare "warranty." Through its new program ProvenExperience, part of Geisinger's ProvenCare portfolio, the health system offers patients refunds if their expectations for kindness and compassion are not met.
Despite warnings against such a program from executive peers in healthcare and other industries, Dr. Feinberg ultimately decided ProvenExperience's refund policy is simply the next practical and necessary step toward a truly patient-centered care model.   
Prior to joining Geisinger, Dr. Feinberg served as President and CEO of the UCLA Health System. He is triple board certified in child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and addiction psychiatry. He has published numerous professional articles and chapters, and he speaks publicly on many topics, including the patient experience, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, autism, pediatric bipolar disorder, pediatric depression, adolescent substance abuse and the industrialization of medicine.
Here, Dr. Feinberg took the time to answer Becker's Hospital Review's seven questions.
Note: These responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
What's one thing that really piqued your interest in healthcare? 
Being able to connect with people.
What do you enjoy most about Danville? 
Joining Geisinger has been incredible from a professional standpoint. From a personal standpoint, coming from Beverly Hills, it has certainly been a transition. There is less traffic and fewer restaurants — but there are some good ones. [My family and I] are loving living in central Pennsylvania.
If you could eliminate one of the healthcare industry's problems overnight, which would it be? 
I would like to eliminate the waiting room and everything it represents. A waiting room means we're provider-centered — it means the doctor is the most important person and everyone is on [his or her] time. We build up inventory for that doctor — that is, the patients in the waiting room.
To be truly patient-centered, we need to get rid of the waiting room. When your child is suicidal or your wife has breast cancer or your parent fell down in the bathroom and they're bleeding, the last thing you want to do is sit and wait. We need to increase access and availability so we can show people we see it is a privilege to take care of them — to tell patients, "We are waiting for you."
What do you consider your greatest talent or skill outside of the C-suite? 
I don't think I have many skills within the C-suite. I'm just one of 30,000 people that make up Geisinger Health System. We get up every day, night, holiday and every weekend to be part of the healing team. When people ask me about work-life balance, I say my work is my life and my life is my work, and I couldn't be happier. There is a real blurring of the lines there. That may seem like the wrong answer to today's generation, but for me, it's very comfortable.
How do you revitalize yourself? 
I over-exercise — sometimes almost to the point of injury. I do cardio, lifting, stretching and walking. And every other moment I have I want to spend with my family.
What's one piece of advice you remember most clearly? 
I had a great mentor when I took on my leadership role at UCLA Hospital System. He told me to just pick one thing to fix in the organization and focus on that. In leadership roles, so much comes your way that if you try to do everything you won't be able to do anything. That one thing I wanted to move the needle on at UCLA, which I did with the great support of the institution, was to make the system more patient-centered.
Now that I'm at Geisinger, I think about the advice everyone gives you as a system's new leader — to go around and listen and don't try to do anything. I spent a lot of time listening, and it was clear to me that one thing we needed to do was take the incredible success Geisinger has had and make sure patients get just what they need.
Ensure patients get what they need and are served with compassion — that was great advice that my mentor gave me about 10 years ago.
What do you consider your greatest achievement at Geisinger so far? 
I don't think it's mine, but I've been a part of it — rolling out ProvenExperience. To us, it's an extension of our ProvenCare Portfolio that started [in 2006]. It was quoted as "surgery with a warranty" by the New York Times. Geisinger employed ProvenCare around illness, then the medical home and chronic care. We launched ProvenExperience a month ago, except this encompasses the whole concept of the care experience.
It includes same-day appointments, people answering the phone and treating patients with dignity and respect. We are also redoing our hospital bill. Because we have a health insurance company, this means you will get a bill you understand. If we don't live up to any of those things, we will give you your money back. Whether we did it right or wrong — we will take the same kind of retail approach like Starbucks or Nordstrom. If you think we didn't do something right, we'll apologize, refund your money and correct it for the next patient. It's an exciting thing that is part of in my first three-quarters of a year at Geisinger.

DANVILLE, Pa., Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Geisinger Health System Foundation Board of Directors announced today the appointment of David T. Feinberg, M.D., M.B.A., as the organization's new president and chief executive officer, effective May 1, 2015.
Dr. Feinberg, who is succeeding Glenn Steele, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., will become only the sixth chief executive officer in Geisinger's 100-year history. He currently serves as president of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System; chief executive officer, UCLA Hospital System; and Associate Vice Chancellor, UCLA Health Sciences in California. During his tenure he has consistently focused on high quality clinical standards for patient care, safety and satisfaction, and the UCLA Health System hospitals have regularly ranked among the best in the United States by U.S. News and World Report.
"We are extremely pleased to have David Feinberg join the Geisinger family as our new president and CEO," said Board Chairman William Alexander.  "Dr. Feinberg has a proven record of achievement, and we are confident that he will do an excellent job leading Geisinger into our second century of service."
"I am honored to become part of the Geisinger family," said Dr. Feinberg. "I have always been impressed with Geisinger's commitment to doing what is right and best for its patients and members, as well as its many contributions to improving care and reforming our nation's health care system.
