Our Story
At Impax Laboratories we are following a growth-oriented strategy to become a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty prescription pharmaceutical products.
Strategic Merger
On December 14, 1999, Global Pharmaceutical Corporation and privately held Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a reverse merger, forming a new organization called Impax Laboratories, Inc. The merger combined the advanced drug delivery systems developed by Impax Pharmaceuticals through its research and development capabilities with Global Pharmaceutical’s sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.

Drug Applications
The synergy created by the merger provided the foundation for the current and future success of the organization. Since 1999, Impax Laboratories consistently files abbreviated new drug applications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) annually, and has received tentative and final approval from the FDA for numerous generic products.
We are also developing proprietary branded products for unmet needs in the treatment of Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. We have one new drug application pending at the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic Parkinson’s disease.

Marketing Partnerships and Business Development
Where strategically appropriate, the Company has developed marketing partnerships to fully leverage its technology platform in order to maximize product revenues and profitability. Impax Laboratories also has two marketing divisions of its own for its products. Its Global Pharmaceuticals division sells generic products, while branded products are marketed through the Impax Pharmaceuticals division.
We are also pursuing generic and brand partnership and business development (M&A) opportunities. Global Pharmaceuticals is looking at opportunities to acquire products, technologies or companies with strategic value mainly in the alternative dosage area, such as injectables, creams and ointments, inhalers or patches. Impax Pharmaceuticals is searching for external growth opportunities with a focus on neurology and psychiatry products.

Impax Generics
Our Generics Division
View website
Impax has developed a portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals through the internal filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and through partnerships on alternative dosage form products. Our generic product development strategy is based on a combination of speed to filing and a legal strategy primarily predicated upon non-infringement of established brand name pharmaceuticals. We are focused on targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability.
Global’s multi-source product line consists of a growing range of solid oral and alternative dosage form prescription pharmaceuticals, distributed primarily through drug wholesalers, distributors, warehousing chains and managed healthcare organizations.
The organization continues to invest in order to provide the highest level of research and development, manufacturing and customer service. Our quality assurance team works closely with our suppliers to ensure purity, consistency and quality of products, and we strive to bring value to our customers with innovative products in key therapeutic areas.
We have a dedicated team of experienced professionals handling customer orders and inquiries that work to not only meet the expectations of our customers, but consistently deliver beyond expectations. Every member of our team is committed to the success and profitability of our customers. We have set the highest standards for our products, services and people, and are proud of the organization we are building.
We develop, manufacture, sell and distribute generic pharmaceutical products primarily through three sales channels:

Product sales channel, for generic pharmaceutical prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers, large retail drug chains, mass merchandisers and mail-order pharmacies
Rx Partner sales channel, for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements
OTC Partner sales channel, for sales of generic pharmaceutical OTC products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements.


Product Development Strategy
Our generic product development strategy is based on two opportunities we've identified in the generic pharmaceutical marketplace:

Controlled-Release Generic Products
Through our controlled-release drug delivery technologies and formulation skills we develop bioequivalent versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals. Controlled-release pharmaceuticals generally have technically challenging drug delivery requirements. We employ our proprietary processes and formulation expertise to develop products that reproduce the brand name product’s physiological characteristics, but do not infringe upon the brand product’s patents.
Specialty Generic Products
Products that present one or more competitive barriers to entry, such as difficulty sourcing raw material, complex formulation or development characteristics, or special handling requirements.

Our Products
We currently manufacture and market 207 generic pharmaceutical products, which represent dosage variations of 72 different pharmaceutical compounds through our Generics Division; another five of our generic pharmaceutical products representing dosage variations of two different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance agreement partners.
Our Pipeline
We currently have more than 20 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) pending at the FDA. We are also working on a number of products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed.
