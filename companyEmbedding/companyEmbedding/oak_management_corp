 Leaf Group 
 
Giving the world what it wants to know.
With information and entertainment now expected to be at everyone’s fingertips, it takes a determined company to make it happen. Today, Leaf Group—with Oak’s investment and partnership—is able to reach more than 125 million visitors every month across a rich portfolio of vertical web properties.


Sean Moriarty, CEO
Leaf Group
 
  
   

 take 
 charge 
 
Eliminating the void.
There are an estimated 60 million under-banked consumers in the US. Almost a decade ago, Oak recognized the value of NetSpend’s offerings and seized the opportunity to partner with us. Today, we are a leading provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards that empower these consumers with the convenience, security, and freedom to be self-banked.


Dan Henry, CEO, 
NETSPEND
 
  
   

 SEEING 
 THROUGH 
 
A major force of change. 
One of the larger problems with today’s healthcare system is a lack of transparency for costs. Castlight Health was founded in 2008 to provide individuals unbiased pricing information with which to make smart purchase decisions. With the backing of Oak, Castlight was able to significantly strengthen our solutions, enhance our team, and develop our strategy.
