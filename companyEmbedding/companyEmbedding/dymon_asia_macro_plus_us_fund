(Bloomberg) -- One man’s junk is another man’s treasure.






That’s a credo that’s helped some of Asia’s top hedge funds this year as peers stumbled, with BFAM Partners, LIM Advisors and Serica Partners Asia surging in 2016 after snapping up or adding commodity-related bonds during a first-quarter selloff. Their performance stood out as the region’s hedge funds struggled with volatile markets in Japan and China, with offerings from Greenwoods Asset Management, Symphony Financial Partners and Tantallon Capital among those with losses.






Asia’s hedge funds are trailing global peers for the first time since 2011, threatening to further erode investor confidence amid a global backlash against lackluster performance and high fees. They’ve eked out a 0.8 percent gain in the 11 months through November, on track for the lowest annual return in five years, according to Eurekahedge data.

“The year has been characterized by a great run in credit,” said Marlon Sanchez, Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific head of prime finance.






Among some of the top hedge funds betting on credit:






BFAM’s multistrategy Asian Opportunities Master Fund, which is expected to end the year with more than $2 billion of assets, gained 16 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the information is private. About 35 percent of its returns this year came from credit trades that include buying distressed commodity bonds in the first quarter whose values have since rebounded, said Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Fuchs, who declined to comment on returns. Other trades include the debt restructuring of Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and selling credit default swaps on embattled commodities firm Noble Group Ltd. to bearish investors in the first half. About half of its return this year came from volatility trades as event such as the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections added to market swings.Serica’s credit fund, run by Ivan Lee in Hong Kong, surged more than 30 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The majority of the profit came from the rebound in the value of Indonesian and resources company bonds it bought at the beginning of the year, said the person. It also made money from a number of distressed credit trades.The $304 million LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, managed by Don Ewer and Peter Warbanoff, made 10 percent after fees in the same period, said George Long, LIM’s chief investment officer. High-yield bonds, especially those in the commodity industry, recovered as the industry rebounded and as some companies refinanced their debt. It also made money from loans, including distressed ones it picked up as early as last year that have rebounded in value, said Long, whose Hong Kong-based multistrategy hedge-fund firm has $1.6 billion of assets under management. Another credit-related hedge fund that shone was OCP Asia’s about $1 billion Orchard Landmark Fund. It returned nearly 13 percent this year through November, making direct loans to small- and medium-sized companies across the Asia-Pacific region, said a person with knowledge of the matter. OCP Asia manages about $1.2 billion out of its Singapore and Hong Kong offices.






Some of this year’s best-performing large hedge funds didn’t focus on credit. Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $3.4 billion macro fund gained about 12 percent in the 11 months, according to an estimate sent to investors. Its $721 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on currencies and gold and takes more concentrated bets, was up 45 percent. Bets on Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, to weaken against the dollar drove returns for both. Separately, the $296 million Credence Global Fund, a relative-value hedge fund that seeks to profit from changes in price relationships between assets, made 12 percent this year, according to an investor newsletter.






On the equity side, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average edged down 0.7 percent through November amid disillusionment with government policies to stoke growth. China funds struggled to claw back from losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 22 percent in January amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown, a falling currency and regulations.






Among some of the funds with losses:






Greenwoods Asset Management’s $1.5 billion Golden China Fund is down 5.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Symphony Financial Partners’s SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in Japanese companies and works with management to prompt actions such as share buybacks, is set to have its first loss since 2009. The fund fell 6 percent this year through November, according to Co-founder David Baran, who said a lot of the volatility and uncertainty that sparked market declines are “somewhat behind us.”The $24 million Tantallon Fund, which trades Asia-Pacific stocks, lost nearly 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund fell nearly 15 percent in March in the worst month in its 13-year history when its bearish bets on most regional indexes and bullish bets on dollar suffered, according to a newsletter posted on its website. Rega Capital Dynamic Value Fund, a long-short China hedge fund, fell 35 percent this year through Nov. 30, according to the firm.






Some equity-focused funds bucked the trend.






Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, managed by Hong Kong-based former Merck & Co. scientist Li Bin, made nearly 27 percent in the first 11 months, according to an update sent to investors. The Asia-focused fund invests in mostly publicly traded stocks in the industry, targeting particularly opportunities created by Chinese medical reforms. Li researched pharmaceutical companies for Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in New York and Hong Kong before joining Ally Bridge Group.The $68.3 million RWC Asia Opportunity Fund rose 16 percent this year, according to an e-mailed statement from London-based RWC Partners. Winning trades include Korean steelmaker Posco and Japan’s Sumco Corp., said Garret Mallal, the fund’s Singapore-based manager.United Gain Investment’s ASEAN Plus Three Segregated Portfolio, with $15 million of assets, rose 16 percent this year, said Lau Chi Yiu, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based firm that oversees $300 million of assets. Profitable trades for the fund that focuses on Southeast Asia as well as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea included Indonesian stocks such as noodles-maker PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk and cement maker PT Semen Baturaja Persero Tbk.






Representatives from Ally Bridge, Greenwoods, Tantallon and Serica declined to comment.

Singapore-based Dymon Asia Capital Ltd. ended the first quarter with a sharp decline in its largest hedge fund, a bruising performance for one of Asia’s biggest managers but also a quick turnaround from heavy losses suffered earlier in the year.  The Dymon Asia Macro Fund is down 5.5% after fees through March, according to a letter sent to investors this week and seen by The Wall Street Journal. The fund slid 10.5% in January, one of many around the world to be rocked by the Swiss National Bank’s shocking decision to...

                Credit funds of OCP, LIM, Serica also had double-digit gains
            



                Greenwoods, Symphony equity hedge funds losing money so far
            













Who Were 2016's Hedge Fund Winners and Losers?




One man’s junk is another man’s treasure.That’s a credo that’s helped some of Asia’s top hedge funds this year as peers stumbled, with BFAM Partners, LIM Advisors and Serica Partners Asia surging in 2016 after snapping up or adding commodity-related bonds during a first-quarter selloff. Their performance stood out as the region’s hedge funds struggled with volatile markets in Japan and China, with offerings from Greenwoods Asset Management, Symphony Financial Partners and Tantallon Capital among those with losses.Asia’s hedge funds are trailing global peers for the first time since 2011, threatening to further erode investor confidence amid a global backlash against lackluster performance and high fees. They’ve eked out a 0.8 percent gain in the 11 months through November, on track for the lowest annual return in five years, according to Eurekahedge data.




For more on hedge fund winners and losers, click here“The year has been characterized by a great run in credit,” said Marlon Sanchez, Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific head of prime finance.Among some of the top hedge funds betting on credit:BFAM’s multistrategy Asian Opportunities Master Fund, which is expected to end the year with more than $2 billion of assets, gained 16 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the information is private. About 35 percent of its returns this year came from credit trades that include buying distressed commodity bonds in the first quarter whose values have since rebounded, said Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Fuchs, who declined to comment on returns. Other trades include the debt restructuring of Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and selling credit default swaps on embattled commodities firm Noble Group Ltd. to bearish investors in the first half. About half of its return this year came from volatility trades as event such as the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections added to market swings.Serica’s credit fund, run by Ivan Lee in Hong Kong, surged more than 30 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The majority of the profit came from the rebound in the value of Indonesian and resources company bonds it bought at the beginning of the year, said the person. It also made money from a number of distressed credit trades.The $304 million LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, managed by Don Ewer and Peter Warbanoff, made 10 percent after fees in the same period, said George Long, LIM’s chief investment officer. High-yield bonds, especially those in the commodity industry, recovered as the industry rebounded and as some companies refinanced their debt. It also made money from loans, including distressed ones it picked up as early as last year that have rebounded in value, said Long, whose Hong Kong-based multistrategy hedge-fund firm has $1.6 billion of assets under management. Another credit-related hedge fund that shone was OCP Asia’s about $1 billion Orchard Landmark Fund. It returned nearly 13 percent this year through November, making direct loans to small- and medium-sized companies across the Asia-Pacific region, said a person with knowledge of the matter. OCP Asia manages about $1.2 billion out of its Singapore and Hong Kong offices.

Some of this year’s best-performing large hedge funds didn’t focus on credit. Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $3.4 billion macro fund gained about 12 percent in the 11 months, according to an estimate sent to investors. Its $721 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on currencies and gold and takes more concentrated bets, was up 45 percent. Bets on Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, to weaken against the dollar drove returns for both. Separately, the $296 million Credence Global Fund, a relative-value hedge fund that seeks to profit from changes in price relationships between assets, made 12 percent this year, according to an investor newsletter.On the equity side, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average edged down 0.7 percent through November amid disillusionment with government policies to stoke growth. China funds struggled to claw back from losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 22 percent in January amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown, a falling currency and regulations.




Among some of the funds with losses:Greenwoods Asset Management’s $1.5 billion Golden China Fund is down 5.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Symphony Financial Partners’s SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in Japanese companies and works with management to prompt actions such as share buybacks, is set to have its first loss since 2009. The fund fell 6 percent this year through November, according to Co-founder David Baran, who said a lot of the volatility and uncertainty that sparked market declines are “somewhat behind us.”The $24 million Tantallon Fund, which trades Asia-Pacific stocks, lost nearly 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund fell nearly 15 percent in March in the worst month in its 13-year history when its bearish bets on most regional indexes and bullish bets on dollar suffered, according to a newsletter posted on its website. Rega Capital Dynamic Value Fund, a long-short China hedge fund, fell 35 percent this year through Nov. 30, according to the firm.Some equity-focused funds bucked the trend.Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, managed by Hong Kong-based former Merck & Co. scientist Li Bin, made nearly 27 percent in the first 11 months, according to an update sent to investors. The Asia-focused fund invests in mostly publicly traded stocks in the industry, targeting particularly opportunities created by Chinese medical reforms. Li researched pharmaceutical companies for Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in New York and Hong Kong before joining Ally Bridge Group.The $68.3 million RWC Asia Opportunity Fund rose 16 percent this year, according to an e-mailed statement from London-based RWC Partners. Winning trades include Korean steelmaker Posco and Japan’s Sumco Corp., said Garret Mallal, the fund’s Singapore-based manager.United Gain Investment’s ASEAN Plus Three Segregated Portfolio, with $15 million of assets, rose 16 percent this year, said Lau Chi Yiu, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based firm that oversees $300 million of assets. Profitable trades for the fund that focuses on Southeast Asia as well as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea included Indonesian stocks such as noodles-maker PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk and cement maker PT Semen Baturaja Persero Tbk.Representatives from Ally Bridge, Greenwoods, Tantallon and Serica declined to comment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
