Enzymotec Is Losing The Omega-3 Krill War - Enzymotec Ltd. (NASDAQ:ENZY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Enzymotec Is Losing The Omega-3 Krill WarApr. 7.17 | About: Enzymotec Ltd. (ENZY) Travis Brown Event-driven, research analyst, long-term horizon, valueDIY Stock InvestorSummaryEnzymotec Ltd. stock price likely to pullback at near 52 week high.Enzymotec Ltd. revenue steadily declines while Neptune's intercepts.Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. shows momentum and increased market share of omega-3 market.Enzymotec Ltd. is a short-pick with quarters of negative EPS and now a $1.63m concession to Neptune.Enzymotec Ltd. (NASDAQ: ENZY) is of the healthcare sector with a two part portfolio of pharmaceutical and nutritional products. Products include baby formula ingredient, memory loss prescription and krill oil (a source of omega-3). The stock reached a 52 week high of $9.32 PPS on August 2, 2016. On that day the trading volume was only 24,283. For the proceeding months the company experienced a steady sell-off, dropping to a 52 week low of $5.20 PPS on November 16, 2016 (YCharts reflects prices at closing). 

ENZY data by YCharts The historic price reaction is significant as it again approached the 52 week high in February of 2017. As of late it remains within 15% of that high mark. The speculative sentiment of a pull-back is compounded when considering that quarterly revenue and earnings have steadily declined. 

ENZY data by YCharts Enzyomotec Competitor Charts Opposing Growth In opposite fashion to Enzymotec's declining revenue and earnings is Neptune Wellness Solutions, aka, Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. (NASDAQ: NEPT). Further review of Neptune can be read at, "Interview: Neptune Wellness Solutions CEO Jim Hamilton."
 They have had two major acquisitions and two major patent settlements/agreements with them being the victors. In addition to the financial gain, Neptune secured the right to use the competitor's patents.  Feb '15 - Acquired NeuroBioPharm Inc. Jan '16 - Acquired Biodroga Inc. Oct '16 - Agreement with Aker BioMarine for a gain of $6m. April '17 - Settlement with Enzymotec Ltd. for a gain of $1.63m.  The synergies and organic growth of Neptune show revenue increasing and paced to overtake the declining revenue of Enzymotec. 

NEPT Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts When the two companies have their earnings per share compared it illustrates further convergence. 

NEPT EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts More On Krill Market Share And The Settlement During the year ended December 31, 2016, our [Enzymotec Ltd.] twelve largest customers accounted for approximately half of our revenues. Our customers generally do not enter long-term purchase commitments with us and we may therefore have limited insight into their future purchasing plans. Our largest customers may determine to lower their purchasers or cease purchasing our products completely. For example, one of our largest purchasers of krill products, which accounted for 15% of our revenues in 2013, purchased our products at significantly lower levels in 2014 through 2016. Even if a significant customer continues to purchase our products at the same or a greater level, their decision to defer purchases, even for a few weeks, could materially adversely impact our results of operations in a particular quarter and can result in quarter-to-quarter variability in our financial results. For example, some of AL’s customers in China deferred purchases from AL, which had an adverse effect on our quarterly results during 2015 and 2016. The success or failure (losing market share, for example) of just a few of our customers’ businesses could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may not develop in a manner that would make us less reliant on a small number of large customers. Our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if a significant customer elects to stop purchasing our products and we are unable to find new purchasers to offset the loss of that customer. - SEC Form Form 20-F (fiscal year ended Dec. '16)
 This statement of risk makes more sense when read within the context of the recent settlement with Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. Neptune can utilize Enzymotec's patents, potentially luring away the customer base. Neptune specializes in omgea-3 products, while this is merely a declining segment of Enzymotec's portfolio. The other risk factor that materialized is Neptune's krill nutrient growth in China. On April 5, 2017 Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. entered a joint venture with a Chinese partner. The JV will lead to the construction of a, "state-of-the-art krill harvesting vessel." In the krill oil market, we [Enzymotec Ltd.] primarily compete with Aker BioMarine AS, Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc., or Neptune, Rimfrost USA, LLC (a joint venture of Avoca, Inc.) and Olympic Seafood AS. See “– Risks relating to our business and industry – The demand for products based on omega-3, and, in particular, premium products such as krill oil, has declined in the past and may continue to decline. This decrease, together with a significant increase in capacity by competing manufacturers [namely Neptune] of these products, has resulted in, and may continue to cause, intense competition and price pressure, which could impair our ability to generate revenues in the krill oil market". - SEC Form Form 20-F (fiscal year ended Dec. '16) Conclusion Enzymotec Ltd. had foreseen Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. as a major risk in the krill/omega-3 space. They had also tried to put-off paying royalties and settlements as long as possible. The recent payment to Neptune and Neptune's expansion into China is the nail in the coffin for Enymotec's krill segment. Furthermore, Neptune is building upon one of its best quarters, has turned profitable, and the fiscal year Q4 2017 results are due out soon. These two healthcare companies are in direct competition with a clear winner. Enzymotec Ltd. is rated a short-sell (short) as a pairs trade with Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc. rated a buy.

Enzymotec Ltd. Reports Commercial Introduction of Its Innovative Omega PC(TM) Advanced Fish Oil Product

MIGDAL HA'EMEQ, Israel, June 23, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enzymotec Ltd. (Nasdaq:ENZY), a developer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative bio-active lipid ingredients, announced today the launch of Omega PC™, a new, premium fish oil-based omega-3 product.

	Omega PC™ is a wild, cold fish extract, containing omega-3 fatty acids bound to phospholipids (PL) and triglycerides (TG). The first commercial sale of this innovative product took place last week in preparation for customer launch.

	"We are very pleased with the launch of Omega PC™ and believe this will take us one step further towards creating a new golden standard for fish oil consumption," said Dr. Ariel Katz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enzymotec Ltd. "Our strategic partnership with Polar Omega enables two significant players in the global omega-3 market to create a product that will deliver new health benefits to consumers. We believe that this new advanced fish oil product should help drive growth in the Omega 3 fish oil market, which became stagnant due to commoditization and lack of innovation."

	Omega PC™ offers the following benefits compared to current omega-3 fish oil:

		Omega-3 fatty acids bound to phospholipids that have been shown to be absorbed better than triglyceride bound Omega-3

		Better absorption leads to better efficacy and to higher accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in target organs

Enzymotec

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Enzymotec is an Israeli speciality chemicals company founded in 1998 at the Naiot Venture Accelerator that markets products created from lipids from raw sources like fish and plants as food ingredients, dietary supplements, and medical food products for adults, children, and infants.[1][2][3][4] As of 2013 it was the second biggest company in the global krill oil market with a 30% market share, and was emphasizing its potential for growth in the Chinese market for infant nutrition with its lipid-based InFat food ingredient.[3]
It began selling medical food products in the US through its subsidiary, Vaya Pharma, in 2011.[1][5]
As of 2013 Enzymotec had raised $17 million and was selling products globally, and in the summer of 2013 it filed a prospectus for its initial public offering on NASDAQ, seeking to raise around $75M;[6] the IPO was held in October and raised $63M.[2]
In 2014 Enzymotec settled litigation with Canada-based Neptune Technologies & Bioressources over patents held by Neptune related to phospholipids like omega-3 oil extracted from krill oil.[7]
In 2015 shareholders filed a class action securities fraud case against Enzymotec over the IPO prospectus, claiming that the company's management had misrepresented its future profitability and the regulatory status of its products in China; most claims in the suit survived a motion to dismiss in December 2015.[8][9]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Enzymotec

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Enzymotec is an Israeli speciality chemicals company founded in 1998 at the Naiot Venture Accelerator that markets products created from lipids from raw sources like fish and plants as food ingredients, dietary supplements, and medical food products for adults, children, and infants.[1][2][3][4] As of 2013 it was the second biggest company in the global krill oil market with a 30% market share, and was emphasizing its potential for growth in the Chinese market for infant nutrition with its lipid-based InFat food ingredient.[3]
It began selling medical food products in the US through its subsidiary, Vaya Pharma, in 2011.[1][5]
As of 2013 Enzymotec had raised $17 million and was selling products globally, and in the summer of 2013 it filed a prospectus for its initial public offering on NASDAQ, seeking to raise around $75M;[6] the IPO was held in October and raised $63M.[2]
In 2014 Enzymotec settled litigation with Canada-based Neptune Technologies & Bioressources over patents held by Neptune related to phospholipids like omega-3 oil extracted from krill oil.[7]
In 2015 shareholders filed a class action securities fraud case against Enzymotec over the IPO prospectus, claiming that the company's management had misrepresented its future profitability and the regulatory status of its products in China; most claims in the suit survived a motion to dismiss in December 2015.[8][9]

Enzymotec Ltd. Announces Appointment of Dror Israel as Chief Financial Officer




















July 28, 2017 08:30 ET

 | Source: Enzymotec Ltd.






MIGDAL HA'EMEQ, Israel, July  28, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enzymotec Ltd. (Nasdaq:ENZY) ("Enzymotec" or the "Company"), a developer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative bio-active lipid based nutritional ingredients and medical foods, today announced that Mr. Dror Israel will join Enzymotec on August 7, 2017 and will assume the position of Vice President and Chief Financial Officer following a transition period. Mr. Israel succeeds Mr. Oren Bryan, who has served as Enzymotec’s Chief Financial Officer since 2008 and will remain on board during the transitional period. “I would like to thank Oren for his enormous contributions to building Enzymotec’s foundation and capabilities and welcome another seasoned finance executive to assume his role as we craft a new strategy that will help to guide the future of the Company. With Oren remaining on board to ensure a smooth transition, Dror’s public company experience will provide the support that will drive Enzymotec’s global outlook,” commented Erez Israeli, Enzymotec’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to drawing from his background as we explore all of our strategic options to expand Enzymotec’s capabilities and product offerings globally.” Dror Israel served as Chief Financial Officer of EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:EZCH) (TASE:EZCH) from July 2001 until February 2016, playing a key role in the sale of EZchip to Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. in February 2016. Prior to that, he was EZchip’s financial controller from January 2000 through May 2001 and a financial analyst at EZchip from August 1997 through December 1999. Prior to joining EZchip, Mr. Israel was employed by Hi Group, a holdings company, as a financial analyst. Mr. Israel holds a B.A. degree in economics from Haifa University and a MBA cum laude from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. Dror Israel added, “I am excited to join the Enzymotec team as they seek to renew the Company’s vision and move towards a new era of profitability and long term growth. The Company’s diverse business units present many opportunities to expand Enzymotec's footprint, and I hope to leverage my extensive experience to take the Company to new heights.” About Enzymotec Ltd.  Enzymotec is a leading global supplier of specialty lipid-based products and solutions. The Company develops, manufactures and markets innovative bio-active lipid ingredients, as well as final products, based on sophisticated processes and technologies. Forward Looking Statements This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, potential market opportunities and the effects of competition. Such statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include the following: a high proportion of the sales of the INFAT® product is to our customers who then use it in their infant formula products sold to end users in China and therefore our revenues are subject to the effects of Chinese market trends and competition from locally produced products that are not subject to import taxes; we are subject to a degree of customer concentration and our customers do not enter into long-term purchase commitments with us; new Chinese regulations relating to infant formula came into force on October 2016 and others are constantly evaluated, affecting the ability of our customers to market infant nutrition products containing INFAT®, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations; we rely on our Swedish joint venture partner to manufacture INFAT®; growth in the Chinese economy has moderated and this slowdown and related volatility could adversely impact demand for our products in China; the demand for products based on omega-3, and, in particular, premium products such as krill oil, has declined in the past and may continue to decline, which, together with a significant increase in capacity by competing manufacturers, may continue to cause intense competition and price pressures; Chinese regulations relating to infant formula are under re-examination, and any regulatory changes affecting the ability of our customers to market infant nutrition products containing INFAT® could adversely affect our business; our inventories include sensitive compounds which may face spoilage or obsolescence; our inability to manage our inventory levels, in particular our high level of inventory relative to sales of our products, may have an adverse effect on our profitability; a significant portion of the sales of our INFAT® product is to a small number of customers and if such customers were to suffer financially or reduce their use of INFAT® our business could be materially adversely affected; variations in the cost of raw materials for the production of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; our offering of products as "medical foods" may be challenged by regulatory authorities; the outcome of the Company's discussions with the FDA relating to the Import Alert; our product development cycle is lengthy and uncertain, and our development or commercialization efforts for our products may be unsuccessful; we are dependent on a single facility that houses the majority of our operations, and disruptions at this facility could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operations; we depend on third parties to obtain raw materials, in particular krill, necessary for the production of our products and if we cannot secure sufficient supply sources at competitive prices or need to utilize a greater percentage of frozen krill than anticipated with current inventory levels, our gross profits from the sale of krill oil will be adversely affected; we anticipate that the markets in which we participate will become more competitive due in part to business combinations among existing competitors, the arrival of new competitors and technological developments; our results are subject to quarterly fluctuations; we may have to pay royalties with respect to sales of our krill oil products in the United States or Australia, and any infringement of intellectual property of others could require us to pay royalties; unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products, such as krill oil, the supplements that contain them as ingredients and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the demand for our products and our ability to generate revenues; we are generally reliant upon third parties for the distribution or commercialization of our products; we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance for our products; we are subject to risks relating to the operation and expansion of our production or processing facilities and capabilities; our ability to obtain krill may be affected by conservation regulation or initiatives; disruption to our IT system could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations; we are not able to predict the results of clinical trials, which may prove unsuccessful or be delayed by certain factors; if we are unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency and quality and meet our customers’ needs, our financial performance could be adversely affected; we could be subject to product liability lawsuits, which could result in costly and time-consuming litigation and significant liabilities; our dependence on international sales, which expose us to risks associated with the business environment in those countries; and other factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2017. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
