bluebird bio, Inc. Key Developments

Bluebird Bio, Inc. Announces Topline Interim Clinical Data from Starbeam Study of Lenti-D™ Drug Product in Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy
Jun 26 17
bluebird bio, Inc. announced topline interim data from the initial cohort of 17 patients in the ongoing Phase 2/3 Starbeam Study (ALD-102) evaluating Lenti-D™ investigational gene therapy in boys under 18 years old with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). As of June 13, 2017, 17 patients with CALD have completed 2 years of follow-up post-Lenti-D treatment, with 15/17 (88%) remaining free of major functional disabilities (MFDs), the primary endpoint of the trial.  This exceeds the pre-defined interim efficacy benchmark for the study of MFD-free survival of 76%, derived from the literature and based on clinical data from an earlier observational study describing that natural history of CALD and outcomes from allogeneic HSCT. In the Starbeam Study, the safety profile of Lenti-D was consistent with myeloablative conditioning. No patients treated with Lenti-D had graft versus host disease (GvHD), and there was no graft rejection or clonal dominance. In December 2016, bluebird bio announced that the Starbeam study had been expanded to treat eight additional patients at sites in Europe and the US, and the study is currently enrolling the additional patients.  The expansion of the study is intended to enable the first manufacture of Lenti-D in Europe, the subsequent treatment of subjects in Europe, and to bolster the overall clinical data package for potential future regulatory filings in the United States and Europe. The Starbeam Study is assessing the efficacy and safety of an investigational gene therapy in boys up to 17 years of age with CALD. It involves transplantation with a patient’s own stem cells, which are modified to contain functional copies of the ABCD1 gene. This gene addition should result in the production of functional adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), a protein critical for the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Buildup of VLCFAs in the central nervous system contributes to neurodegeneration in CALD. Subjects enrolled in the study are eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but with no matched sibling donor. Confirmed early-stage, active CALD as indicated by gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Have a Loes score between 0.5 " 9.0 and have an NFS of one or less.


bluebird bio Seeks Acquisitions
Jun 26 17
bluebird bio, Inc. (NasdaqGS:BLUE) has filed a Follow-on Equity Offering in the amount of $350 million. The company intends to use the funds to further expand its manufacturing platform and capabilities to support ongoing and anticipated product development efforts, and in anticipation of a potential commercial launch; and for general and administrative expenses, potential future development programs and early-stage research and development, capital expenditures and working capital and other general corporate purposes.


bluebird bio Announces Early Data from Phase 3 Northstar-2 (HGB-207) Study of LentiGlobin Drug Product at European Hematology Association Annual Meeting
Jun 23 17
bluebird bio, Inc. announced early interim data from the ongoing Northstar-2 (HGB-207) Phase 3 clinical study of LentiGlobin drug product in patients with transfusion-dependent -thalassemia (TDT) and non- /genotypes. These data will be presented by Mark Walters, M.D., UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, Oakland, California, in an oral session on Sunday, June 25 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain. Northstar-2 is first study to utilize improved LentiGlobin drug product manufacturing process to increase the drug product vector copy number and percent of cells transduced. The first patient treated in this study exemplifies the promise of gene therapy, discontinuing blood transfusions approximately a month after treatment and achieving a normal level of total hemoglobin production at six months post-treatment. These early results suggest that the improved manufacturing process results in consistently higher drug product vector copy numbers (VCN) and lentiviral vector positive (LVV+) cells, which is correlated with higher production of HbA and ultimately may address known patient-to-patient variability. The Northstar-2 Study is an ongoing, open-label, single-dose, international, multicenter Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin drug product for the treatment of patients with TDT and non-/genotypes. As of June 2, 2017, drug product had been manufactured for six patients. The median DP VCN for these patients was 3.0 (range: 2.4 4.0), compared to a median DP VCN of 0.7 (range: 0.3 1.5) in Northstar.
