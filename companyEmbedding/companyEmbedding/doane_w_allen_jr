Aker Philly Delivers Containership to Matson                                                        

Matson Navigation Company, Inc. announced that its newest containership, MV Maunalei, has been delivered to the company by Aker Philadelphia Shipyard. The delivery of the Maunalei represents the completion of a historic four ship modernization and replacement strategy, following the delivery of the Manukai in 2003, the Maunawili in 2004, and the Manulani in 2005. "Having added only one new ship to the Matson fleet between 1983 and 2002, the four new vessels with a capital cost of over $500 million are essential to the current and future success of Matson," said W. Allen Doane, the Chairman of Matson and the Chairman and CEO of its parent company, Alexander & Baldwin. "The average age of Matson's ships was 25 years before the first ship was delivered in 2003.



Matson Says its China Service is Profitable                                                         

Matson Navigation Co. Inc., the Oakland, Calif.-based maritime shipping subsidiary of Honolulu-based A&B posted 7 percent more third-quarter revenue but 7 percent lower operating profit. That still meant a profit above $34 million, however. The China service, launched early this year, carried more than 10,000 containers, triple Guam traffic and almost a quarter of Hawaii traffic. "The contributions from Matson's China service increased from the prior quarter, and the service is profitable," said Allen Doane, CEO of the parent company. Everything is measured against projections, however, and Doane said even this performance was lower than "planned levels" as favorable container volumes were more than offset by lower rates and higher fuel and intermodal rail costs.



MV Manukai Christened in Philadelphia                                                               

Matson Navigation Company, Inc.âs (Matson) new containership MV Manukai was christened today by Margaret Inouye, wife of Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, at a ceremony held at Philadelphia Kvaerner Shipyard, Inc. (KPSI). The vessel is the first of a two-ship, $220 million contract with KPSI. Among those present for the ceremony were Senator Inouye, Governor Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, Charles M. Stockholm, chairman of the board, Alexander and Baldwin, Inc., and Allen Doane, president and CEO, Alexander and Baldwin, Inc., and chairman of the board, Matson. The Manukai is the first new Matson vessel built since 1992, when the MV R. J. Pfeiffer entered the companyâs service, and the first new Matson ship of the 21st century.



A&B Issues Statement on Hawaii Earthquake                                                           

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. "As many of you are aware, an earthquake struck the Hawaiian Islands this morning. The undersea quake, which was centered off of the island of Hawaii (the "Big Island"), struck at 7:07 am local time and was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks. Thankfully, initial reports indicate that casualties were limited and that there were no fatalities. As always, A&B stands ready to assist and support its employees, customers and fellow Hawaii citizens in dealing with the aftermath of the quake. "Fortunately, A&B's operations and real estate properties avoided any serious interruptions or damage as a result of the earthquake, and our terminal operations and agricultural facilities continue to operate.

 




















Mulholland Retires from Matson and A&B                                                              

After more than 38 years of service, C. Bradley Mulholland will retire, effective January 1, 2004, from both Matson Navigation Company, Inc., which he serves as vice chairman of the board. He also will retire from his position as executive vice president of Alexander & Baldwin, Inc., Matsonâs parent company, and from director positions on the boards of both companies. Mulholland joined Matson in 1965 and served in a variety of increasingly responsible positions throughout the company, ultimately being named president and chief operating officer of Matson in 1990, and then president and chief executive officer in 1992. He became vice-chairman of the board in 2002.



Svitzer Bags FSRU Support Contract in Bangladesh

Svitzer will provide marine support services for the Excelerate Energy FSRU at Bangladeshâs first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal. Excelerate Energy Bangladesh Limited awarded Svitzer the 15-year contract following a competitive tender process. The contract also includes a five-year option. Bangladeshâs first LNG import terminal, located offshore Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal, will enable Petrobangla, the state owned energy company, to increase natural gas supply in the country by up to 20 percent, sufficient to support up to 3,000 MW of power generation capacity. The construction of the terminal will commence in the fourth quarter of 2017 and is anticipated to be in service by mid- 2018.



New Tug Joins Harley Marine Fleet


Harley Marine Services has welcomed its newest vessel, Dr Hank Kaplan, to its Puget Sound fleet on June 22. The vessel has a length of 80', a beam of 36' and a depth of 13'7" and is equipped with two 3516C marine propulsion engines that deliver a combined 5,350 HP. The vessel also features the brand new Cat MTA 524-T azimuth thrusters, which were specially designed for high performance tractor tugboats. Designed by Robert Allen Limited in Vancouver, the tug was built at Diversified Marine in Portland, Ore. and is a sister class vessel to the recently built Michelle Sloan and Lela Franco. 



Matson Containership MV Maunawili Christened in Philadelphia                                        


Matson Navigation Company, Inc.'s  new containership MV Maunawili was christened Saturday, July 17 at Kvaerner Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc. (KPSI) by Ms. Maryanna G. Shaw, great grand-daughter of Samuel T. Alexander, one of the founders of Matson's parent company, Alexander and Baldwin, Inc. (A&B). The vessel is the second of a two-ship, $220 million contract with KPSI. Among those present for the ceremony will be Charles M. Stockholm, chairman of the board, A&B, Allen Doane, president and CEO, A&B, James Andrasick, president and CEO, Matson, and the event's keynote speaker, Lt.

Admiral Thad Allen Join RAND as Senior Fellow

Adm. Thad W.

Thomson. âWe are delighted he will continue to take on the most difficult policy challenges as a RAND senior fellow. Allen was scheduled to join RAND in May 2010, shortly after he retired as commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.

Mr. Allen is a British citizen, with hands-on experience from work in several different countries.



The Thad Allen No-Frills Leadership Primer


Every year there are countless books written about leadership and management, supplemented by a mountain of similarly themed magazine articles and scholarly treatises, eagerly snapped up by legions of wanna-be bosses and officers. As a culture, we are obsessed with leadership, especially leaders as heroic figures, and we are constantly seeking the right formula to make us so. But all those would-be captains of industry â and the oceans â might find it a lot easier to step away from the stacks and take a page from a leader extraordinaireâ¦ 



Sunken Japanese WWII Battleship Found


Seventy years after the conclusion of World War II, philanthropist and entrepreneur Paul G. Allen has located the Musashi, one of the two largest and most technologically advanced battleships in naval history. Allen and his team of researchers began their search for the Musashi more than eight years ago. Using historical records from four countries, detailed undersea topographical data and advanced technology aboard his yacht, M/Y Octopus, Allen and his team located the battleship in the Sibuyan Sea on March 1, 2015.

According to UPI, an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that when the head of the U.S. Coast Guard steps down in May, the White House will be nominating Coast Guard chief of staff Vice Adm. Thad Allen to the position. Allen -- who burnished his reputation, and that of the agency, when he stepped in to take control of post-Katrina recovery operations from the disgraced and later fired head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael Brown â is said to be the most qualified candidate. UPI reported that Allen had been a favorite inside the agency long before his military bearing and take-charge mannerâ¦
