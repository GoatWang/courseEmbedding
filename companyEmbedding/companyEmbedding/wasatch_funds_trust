WASATCH FUNDS - NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS      JUNE 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION                                                                 

   Wasatch Funds, Inc. is a Minnesota corporation registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end management investment
company and consists of 11 series or "funds" (each a "Fund" and collectively the
"Funds"). The Core Growth, Global Science & Technology, Heritage Growth,        
International Growth, International Opportunities, Micro Cap, Micro Cap Value,  
Small Cap Growth, Small Cap Value and Ultra Growth Funds (collectively the      
"Equity Funds") are non-diversified funds and the Wasatch-Hoisington U.S.       
Treasury Fund ("U.S. Treasury Fund") is a diversified fund. Each Fund maintains 
its own investment objective. The Funds have entered into an investment advisory
agreement with Wasatch Advisors, Inc. (the "Advisor") as investment advisor.    

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

The following is a summary of significant policies related to   
investments of the Funds held at June 30, 2005.                                 

        VALUATION OF SECURITIES-Securities are valued as of the close of the New
York Stock Exchange (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on the valuation date.   
Equity securities are valued using a commercial pricing service at the latest   
quoted sales price or official closing price taken from the primary market in   
which each security trades. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market and
listed securities for which there were no transactions are valued at the closing
bid price. Debt securities (other than short-term instruments) are valued at    
current market value by a commercial pricing service, or by using the last sale 
or bid price. Short-term securities, which mature in 60 days or less, are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Restricted securities,      
private placements, other illiquid securities and other securities for which    
market value quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as   
determined by a designated Pricing Committee, comprised of personnel of the     
Advisor, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, in accordance with    
pricing procedures approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is defined as 
the amount the owner of a security might reasonably expect to receive upon a    
current sale. For each applicable investment that is fair valued, the Pricing   
Committee considers, to the extent applicable, various factors including, but   
not limited to, the financial condition of the company or limited partnership,  
operating results, prices paid in follow-on rounds, comparable companies in the 
public market, the nature and duration of the restrictions for holding the      
securities, and other relevant factors.                                         

      Additionally, a Fund's investments will be valued at fair value by the
Pricing Committee if the Advisor determines that an event impacting the value of
an investment occurred between the closing time of a security's primary market  
or exchange (for example, a foreign exchange or market) and the time the Fund's 
share price is calculated.  Significant events include, but are not limited to  
the following: significant fluctuations in domestic markets, foreign markets or 
foreign currencies; occurrences not directly tied to the securities markets such
as natural disasters, armed conflicts or significant governmental actions; and  
major announcements affecting a single issuer or an entire market or market     
sector. In responding to a significant event, the Pricing Committee would       
determine the fair value of affected securities considering factors including,  
but not limited to: index options and futures traded subsequent to the close;   
ADRs, GDRs or other related receipts; currency spot or forward markets that     
trade after pricing of the foreign exchange; other derivative securities traded 
after the close such as WEBs and SPDRs; and alternative market quotes on the    
affected securities.  In addition, the Funds may us a systematic fair valuation 
model provided by an independent third party in certain circumstances to assist 
in adjusting the valuation of foreign securities.                               

        As of June 30, 2005, the aggregate amount of fair valued securities as a
percentage of net assets for the Funds was as follows:                          

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                 
Core Growth Fund                            0.17%
Global Science & Technology Fund            0.26%
Heritage Growth Fund                           - 
International Growth Fund                  <0.01%
International Opportunities Fund            0.67%
Micro Cap Fund                              0.96%
Micro Cap Value Fund                        1.35%
Small Cap Growth Fund                       0.59%
Small Cap Value Fund                        4.59%
Ultra Growth Fund                           1.56%
U.S. Treasury Fund                             - 

  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS-Values of investments denominated in
foreign currencies are converted into U.S. dollars using the current exchange   
rate. Purchases and sales of investments are translated into U.S. dollars using 
the current exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Transactions in   
foreign denominated assets may involve greater risks than domestic transactions,
including currency, political, economic, regulatory and market risks.           

       INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES-Security transactions are accounted for on the
trade date.                                                                     

      SHORT SALES-To a limited extent, the Equity Funds may enter into short
sales whereby a fund sells a security it generally does not own (the security is
borrowed), in anticipation of a decline in the security's price. If a fund      
shorts a security when also holding a long position in the security (a "short   
against the box"), as the security price declines, the short position increases 
in value, offsetting the long position's decrease in value. The opposite effect 
occurs if the security price rises. The Funds designate collateral consisting of
cash, U.S. government securities or other liquid assets sufficient to           
collateralize the market value of short positions.                              

     OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS - The Equity Funds may buy and sell put and call
options, write covered put and call options, including over-the-counter options,
on portfolio securities where the completion of the obligation is dependent upon
the credit standing of another party. The risk in writing a call option is that 
a Fund gives up the opportunity for profit if the market price of the security  
increases. The risk in writing a put option is that a Fund may incur a loss if  
the market price of the security decreases and the option is

OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)                                                

exercised. The risk in buying an option is that a Fund pays a premium whether or
not the option is exercised. A Fund also has the additional risk of not being   
able to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not  
exist. Option contracts are valued daily and unrealized appreciation or         
depreciation is recorded. A Fund will realize a gain or loss upon expiration or 
closing of the option transaction. When an option is exercised, the proceeds on 
sales for a written call option, the purchase cost for a written put option, or 
the cost of a security for a purchased put or call option is adjusted by the    
amount of premium received or paid. The Micro Cap Value Fund wrote 750 option   
contracts with premiums of $174,410 and closed 750 option contracts with        
premiums of $24,675 during the nine month period ended June 30, 2005.           

       REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS--The Funds may engage in repurchase transactions.
Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, a fund takes possession of an
underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase 
and the fund to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time. The    
market value of the collateral must be equal at all times to the total amount of
the repurchase obligations, including interest. Generally, in the event of      
counterparty default, the fund has the right to use the collateral to offset    
losses incurred.                                                                

3. FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION                                               

        As of June 30, 2005, the cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation)
of securities, excluding securities sold short, on a tax basis were as follows:

(1)Inception date of the Fund was January 27, 2005.                             

The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized gains are primarily  
attributable to wash sales and other temporary tax adjustments.

Data shows past performance, which is not indicative of future performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. To obtain the most recent month-end performance data available, please click on the “Performance” tab of the individual fund under the “Our Funds” section. The Advisor may absorb certain Fund expenses, without which total return would have been lower. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
Wasatch Funds will deduct a 2.00% redemption proceeds fee on Fund shares held 60 days or less. Performance data does not reflect the deduction of fees, including sales charges, or the taxes you would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. Fees and taxes, if reflected, would reduce the performance quoted. Wasatch does not charge any sales fees. For more complete information including charges, risks and expenses, read the prospectus carefully.
Wasatch Funds are subject to risks, including loss of principal. Performance for the Core Growth, Small Cap Value, and Large Cap Value Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 1/31/2012 is based on the performance of the Investor Class shares. Performance for the Long/Short Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 12/13/2012 is based on the Investor Class shares. Performance for the Emerging India, Emerging Markets Small Cap, Frontier Emerging Small Countries, Global Opportunities, International Growth, International Opportunities, Small Cap Growth, and World Innovators Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 2/1/2016 is based on the performance of the Investor Class shares.  Fund Performance during the above periods referenced includes the actual expenses of the Fund's Investor Class shares without any adjustments.

 The Dos And Don'ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       The Dos And Don’ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? SETTING UP A TRUST FUND: WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER CONSIDER DOING Parents tend to make mistakes. It kind of goes with the job when you become one. No parent is going to be perfect. This also goes for setting up a trust fund for their kids. There are many parents who have made quite a few mistakes with this. You are here so you can learn from these mistakes. Learn what not to do when setting up a trust.  WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR KID’S TRUST FUNDThis is probably the number one mistake parents make when setting up a trust fund for their kids. They fail to select the appropriate trustee for their kids. There are two different types of trustees. There is the Single trustee. There is also the co-trustee. This one offers more of a checks-and-balances protocol in the system. It really doesn’t matter who you pick, just make sure it’s someone you trust 100% and beyond. What is going to happen once you are no longer there? The trustee can say or go along with anything you want, as long as you are still alive. Once you are dead and gone, this person might just take the reins. This can be both good and bad. Please make sure you are selecting someone you really do have faith in.  THINK ABOUT THE PATH OF THE MONEY This is the second mistake many parents make. They set up a trust. However, they fail to set up a direction for the trust. Guys, you have to do this. Figure out how and when the money should be dispersed out. Do you really want to leave this up to a neutral party? This can and will happen. When it does, you might not be happy with the results. This is your money. These are your kids. Set up some goals.A LIST OF BENEFICIARIES Setting up the trust and the trustee are the first steps. Afterwards, you have to set up a small list of beneficiaries. This way the money goes back and forth where it’s intended to be. You have to have protocols in place to make sure all your plans are happening, as well as people to do the job. You cannot leave this up to chance. Too many parents have left it up to chance. The kids ended up suffering because of it. A trust fund is not just about money. It’s about your kids and their future. Please make sound choices here. Part of providing well for your kids is making good choices with the people involved. Go with your gut. If your gut says to not trust someone with this charge, than listen to it.
