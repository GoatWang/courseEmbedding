Kiltearn Partners
Kiltearn Partners LLP was incorporated in 2011 by Murdo Murchison and his founding partners, with the support of Silchester International Investors. 
Kiltearn offers a single global equity program, managed with a disciplined value investment philosophy. Kiltearn's Chief Investment Officer, Murdo Murchison, was a senior investment professional with Templeton Global Advisers for 15 years, latterly as the second manager after Sir John Templeton of the firm’s flagship product, the Templeton Growth Fund. In that environment, he had the opportunity to successfully implement a disciplined value investment philosophy with a global mandate. The formation of Kiltearn has allowed Murdo and his partners to implement the same time-tested value philosophy in a firm which offers a strong alignment of interests between the partners of Kiltearn and its institutional clients.
      
Kiltearn Partners LLP is based in Edinburgh, Scotland, with a client service/marketing office in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.

Investment Philosophy
      
Kiltearn Partners LLP employs a disciplined value philosophy.  This philosophy is distinguished by four key features:
Global– Our greatest opportunity lies in undervalued companies.  These opportunities surface in different countries and different industries at different times.  So we search globally for value.
Long-term– Stock market values often fluctuate to a much greater degree than underlying business values.  Experience teaches us that such volatility frequently creates opportunities for the patient, long-term investor.
Fundamental– Kiltearn focuses its resources on the bottom-up, fundamental analysis of individual companies.  We are interested in two factors - the price paid to own a piece of a business and the quality of that business.
Benchmark Agnostic – Portfolios are built with a bottom-up approach; one stock at a time.  We believe the best way to outperform the benchmark is by having the courage to differ from it.
