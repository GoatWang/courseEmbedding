 Student Ratings 1 - 2 of 2  ACTG 2120 Principles of Accounting II 1 Cons: Don't appear to want to be in the class and gets super irritated when there are too many questions asked.
Tests are super difficult and teaching style does not prepare you for the style of tests given.
There were times that he didn't feel like explaining how to work problems so he would just put the worked problem on a projector and tell us that's what it should look like, then he wondered why the class average was below a 60.Dr. Burton is a very nice person but not a professor I would ever take again.  Professor rated by: Business Administration Student on April 6, 2016Helpful Rating?YESNO   ACTG 2120 Principles of Accounting II 1 Pros: noneCons: This professors test aren't even what he tells you to study. All he grades is four test and definitely can't teach !!  Professor rated by: Student on February 12, 2016Helpful Rating?YESNO

                  He is a good teacher and really taught my class on more than just an educational stand point. He taught us life skills along side our required material. Definitely a good class but he is hard to deal with the first few classes. He has a style of teaching that doesn't really change.

                  This class was life changing... at the end of the semester he helped us all realize what truly matters in life. This man has a beautiful heart even though he can be an aggressive lion, its all out of love.

                  Amazing man! Who knew that taking this class was going to change my life!! This class was short over the summer, but I wish it was long. You earn your grade!He has so much wisdom, I almost cried after taking the final. Just an overall great guy that will teach you so many things that you will keep forever. Many will say he's hard or mean, he's REAL

                  This class was HARD! But I learned a lot. I took the class over the summer (maymester) and you really have to work for the grade, nothing is handed to you. There were 3 exams, all difficult. Study hard, read the book, and be prepared to pull your hair out and learn. Class was enterntaining though and he never kept us the whole time. I got an A.

                  All of his classes are hard, with the exception of Research on the Internet.  He is rude to students and doesn't seem to care about them.  No matter what he tells you, you have to read the book and study his powerpoints, because you don't know what will be on the test.  He just reads directly from his powerpoints.  He makes you feel stupid.

                  He is a very hard teacher, and so are his tests.  He doesn't seem to care about his students.  Also, whatever he tells you is going to be on the test, don't study it because none of it will be on there!

Hi, we’re Co-op Cycles

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.




Explore kids' bikes














BIKES WORTH RIDING

BIKES WORTH RIDING

Watch now









































Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Eric James carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Eric James



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Eric James



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Eric James



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
