(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) equity in trading account, consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (ii) cash at bank and (iii) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of 2017.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, forward, options, swaps and other derivatives trading and U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by net realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income and redemptions of Units.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Partnership capital decreased 7.7% from $26,777,385 to $24,708,355. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 66,545.814 limited partners Units totaling $1,307,075 and a net loss of $761,955. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods.  Other than as discussed above, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the Financial Statements.  The Partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  Results of Operations  The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisor and the ability of the Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and options markets.  The Trading Advisor trades the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system. The Diversified Program is a proprietary, systematic global futures trading program. Its goal is the generation of significant long-term capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns. This program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial, currency and commodity markets, searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months.  The Trading Advisor has designed the Diversified Program to have broad market diversification (subject to liquidity constraints). Aspect's quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets.  The Trading Advisor's Diversified Program trades over 100 markets in the seven major sectors: currencies, energy, metals, stock indices, bonds, agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies. Aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its reward/risk ratio and capacity. Aspect has no market or sector preferences, believing that allowing for liquidity effects, equal profitability can be achieved in the long-term in all markets. The key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity. Correlations are analyzed at the sector, sub-sector, economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified.  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisor's trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts," on open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  During the Partnership's first quarter of 2017, the net asset value per Unit decreased 2.9% from $19.83 to $19.25, as compared to a decrease of 0.2% during the first quarter of 2016. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2017 of $427,542. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity, currencies and interest rates sectors and were partially offset by gains in the equity sector. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2016 of $707,439. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity and interest rates sectors and were partially offset by losses in the equity and currencies sectors.  The most significant losses were incurred within the global interest rate markets primarily during January and March from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined amid speculation of growing hawkish sentiment in central banks across the globe. Within the energy markets, losses were recorded during January and February from long positions in natural gas futures as mild weather throughout much of the U.S. reduced demand from homes and businesses. Additional losses within the energy complex were experienced during March from crude oil and oil distillates futures positions. Within the currency markets, losses were recorded primarily during March from short positioning on European currencies versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of European currencies strengthened on positive economic data and hawkish rhetoric released by the European Central Bank. Additional losses in this sector were recorded from positions in the New Zealand dollar, British pound, and Japanese yen. Within the agricultural markets, losses were incurred during January from short positions in wheat futures as prices rose after the release of industry reports which indicated U.S. farmers may allocate fewer acres to corn and wheat plantings in 2017. Additional losses were experienced during the first half February from short positions in wheat futures as prices rose following an improved outlook for U.S. exports. A portion of the Partnership's losses during the quarter was offset by trading gains achieved during February and March from long positions in U.S., European, and Asian equity index futures as prices were buoyed by positive economic sentiment across the globe. Positive sentiment also fueled gains for long positions in U.S. and Asian equity index futures during January. Additional gains were experienced within the metals sector during January and February from long positions in industrial metals futures as prices increased amid a combination of bullish fundamentals, especially from China, and some supply disruptions.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures, forward and options trading accounts established for the Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in Futures Interests, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests and U.S. Treasury bills may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets. There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its equity in trading accounts, consisting of (a) cash on deposit with MS&Co., a portion of which is to be used as margin for trading, (b) net unrealized gains or losses on futures and forward contracts, which calculated as the difference between the original contract value and fair value and (c) U.S. Treasury bills, at fair value. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in Futures Interests and U.S. Treasury bills in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units. There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  The General Partner estimates that at any given time approximately 27.5% to 57.4% of the Partnership's contracts are traded OTC.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisor and the ability of the Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and options markets.  The Trading Advisor trades the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system. The Diversified Program is a proprietary, systematic global futures trading program. Its goal is the generation of significant long-term capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns. This program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial, currency and commodity markets, searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months.  The Trading Advisor has designed the Diversified Program to have broad market diversification (subject to liquidity constraints). Aspect's quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets.  The Trading Advisor's Diversified Program trades over 100 markets in the seven major sectors: currencies, energy, metals, stock indices, bonds, agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies. Aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its reward/risk ratio and capacity. Aspect has no market or sector preferences, believing that allowing for liquidity effects, equal profitability can be achieved in the long-term in all markets. The key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity. Correlations are analyzed at the sector, sub-sector, economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified.  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisor's trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts" and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, brokerage fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem its Units at the net asset value per Unit as of the end of any month on the last business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions generally are funded out of the Partnership's cash holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 251,153.610 limited partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $5,312,569 and 2,545.118 General Partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $55,229. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 197,692.135 limited partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $4,284,200 and 1,130.710 General Partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $25,000. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 990,196.837 limited partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $15,905,958 and 16,245.637 General Partner Units of Class A were redeemed totaling $275,000.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 11.8% from $22.49 to $19.83. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit increased 6.6% from $21.09 to $22.49. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit increased 29.6% from $16.27 to $21.09.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,917,022 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity, equity and currencies sectors and were partially offset by gains in the interest rates sector. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The most significant losses were recorded in the metals sector, primarily during February, March, and April from short positions in gold and silver futures as prices advanced amid increased investor demand for precious metals. Further losses in the metals sector were incurred throughout the first quarter from positions in zinc futures. Losses within the metals during August were experienced from long positions in silver futures as prices moved lower due to weakening investor demand. Additional losses were recorded in metals during October and December from short and long futures positions in industrial metals. Within the currency sector, losses were incurred during February from short positions in the Swiss franc and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the U.S. dollar weakened amid concern of growing vulnerability of the U.S. economy. Further losses within this sector were recorded during March from short positions in the Korean won, euro, Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar as the relative value of the U.S. dollar weakened following dovish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that pushed out expectations for an interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank. Additional losses within this sector were recorded during May from long positions in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the U.S. currency rallied after hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve. During November, losses in the currencies were recorded from long positions in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the two currencies diverged amid weak economic data in Australia and speculation the incoming U.S. presidential administration would spur economic growth. Within the agricultural sector, losses were experienced during January from long cocoa futures positions after better-than-expected supplies from West Africa, prospects of waning chocolate demand, and a broader commodity market sell-off sent cocoa futures prices lower. Further losses in this sector were incurred during March from short coffee futures positions as prices were boosted by a combination of a stronger Brazilian real and concerns regarding dry weather in Colombian and Brazilian coffee growing regions. During July, losses incurred within this sector were from long soybean futures positions as prices decreased amid reports the U.S. crop remained in good to excellent condition. During October, losses were experienced from short cattle futures positions as prices increased following a low recorded number of the animals in feedlots. During November, losses were incurred from long coffee futures positions as prices decreased after forecasts of South American supplies increased and the weakening relative value of the Brazilian real dampened the market's outlook. Further losses in the agricultural markets were recorded during December from long positions in soybean futures as prices declined. The Partnership's trading losses for the year were partially offset by trading gains within the global interest rate sector during January and February from long positions in European and Pacific Rim fixed income futures as prices advanced after weakness in Chinese economic data revived concern about the stability of the global economy. Additional gains were experienced during June from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices moved higher as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the U.K.'s vote in late June to leave the European Union increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $4,564,153 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity sector and were partially offset by losses in equity, currencies and interest rates sectors.  The most significant gains were achieved within the energy sector during January, March, and the second half of the year from short positions in crude oil and oil related products as prices were weighed down by a rising dollar and an oil supply glut in the marketplace. Gains within the metals complex were achieved from short lead futures positions during February and short nickel futures positions during March as prices decreased amid concern over a deepening economic slowdown in China. Additional gains in this sector were experienced during June through September from short positions in palladium, platinum, aluminum and nickel futures as prices declined due to a strengthening U.S. dollar and additional signs of an economic slowdown in China. During November further gains in metals were experienced from short positions in copper futures as prices declined as weak economic data from China continued to dampen demand prospects within an already oversupplied market. The Partnership's gains for the year were partially offset by losses experienced within the global stock index sector primarily during June, August, and December from long U.S. and Asian Pacific equity index futures positions as prices declined due to concerns associated with slowing global economic growth, the Greek financial crisis, and a stronger U.S. dollar.  Losses within the currency sector were experienced during January from short Swiss franc positions versus the U.S. dollar and euro as the value of the franc rallied sharply following the surprise decision by the Swiss National Bank to abandon its cap on the Swiss franc's strength against the euro. Further losses within this sector were experienced during April and June from short positions in the Japanese yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar weakened. Additional currency losses were achieved during October from short Canadian, New Zealand, and Australian dollar positions versus the U.S. dollar as "commodity currencies" rallied as global commodities prices rose. During December losses were incurred in this sector from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the euro reversed higher against the dollar after the European Central Bank ("ECB") did not expand its monthly bond purchasing program. Within the global interest rate sector, losses were incurred during February, April, May, and June from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined due to an increase in probability the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. During December losses were experienced in this sector from long European bond futures positions as prices reversed sharply lower after the ECB announced new stimulus measures that fell short of market expectations. In the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during the second half of June from short corn and wheat futures positions as prices spiked due to crop concerns following heavy rainfall in the U.S. Midwest region. Additional losses were recorded during April, September, and October from short sugar futures positions as prices climbed higher on concern that rain would damage the sugar crop and disrupt the harvest in Brazil, the world's top sugar producer.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $10,704,797 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity, currencies and interest rates sectors and were partially offset by losses in the equity sector.  The most significant gains were experienced within the energy sector during September through December from short positions in crude oil and its related contracts as prices moved lower as U.S. oil production advanced to record levels and after OPEC decided not to reduce crude oil production amid a global supply surplus. Within the global interest rate sector, gains were experienced in ten of the twelve months during 2014 from long fixed income futures positions as prices rose amid central banks globally maintaining loose monetary policies to stimulate economic growth and stem deflation. Fixed income futures found additional support during the year as geopolitical tensions increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Within the currency sector, gains were achieved during the last five months of the year from short positions in the Japanese yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar as diverging central bank policy paths contributed to a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank both focused on keeping interest rates low, while the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated higher interest rates, which benefited the Partnership's short non-U.S. currency positions. Additional gains were experienced during February, March, and June from long positions in the New Zealand dollar versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the New Zealand dollar appreciated after the country's central bank raised interest rates. Within the agriculturals complex, gains were achieved during the first quarter from long lean hog futures positions as prices rallied due to a spreading virus, which caused slaughter rates to decline and supplies to shrink. Additional gains were achieved in this sector during the third quarter from short positions in soybean, corn, and wheat futures as prices declined amid favorable growing conditions and increased speculation of record crop yields. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the year was offset by losses recorded within the metals sector from long and short precious metals futures positions as prices whipsawed throughout much of the year following geopolitical concerns in emerging markets, Ukraine, and the Middle East, which caused investor anxiety and sporadic demand for "safe-haven" assets. Additional losses were recorded throughout a majority of 2014 from base metals futures positions as prices fluctuated on varying economic news from China. Within the global stock index sector, losses were recorded during January from long positions in U.S., European, and Asian equity index futures as prices declined after disappointing economic growth in China and the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement to further taper its quantitative easing program. Additional losses were incurred during September, October, and December from long positions in U.S., European, and Asian equity index futures as prices fell as a decline in the energy complex, the Russian ruble crisis, and uncertainty in European monetary policy all fueled a general risk reduction in stocks.  For an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of 2016 trading results, refer to the Partnership's Annual Report to limited partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Market Risk.  The Partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. The Partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by the Partnership at the same time, and the Trading Advisor was unable to offset positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to 100% of their capital accounts.  In addition to the Trading Advisor's internal controls, the Trading Advisor must comply with the Partnership's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The Trading Advisor and Ceres monitor the Partnership's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and Ceres can require the Trading Advisor to modify positions of the Partnership if Ceres believes they violate the Partnership's trading policies.  Credit Risk.  In addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and option contracts, there is a credit risk to the Partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the Partnership for futures, forward and option contracts traded in the U.S., and most foreign exchanges on which the Partnership trades, is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its members or one of its member's customers, which should significantly reduce this credit risk. There is no assurance that a clearinghouse, exchange, or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the Partnership, and Ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the Partnership against a default by such parties. Further, the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the broker's customers. In cases where the Partnership trades off-exchange forward contracts with a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the forward contract's counterparty.  Ceres deals with these credit risks of the Partnership in several ways. First, Ceres monitors the Partnership's credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis. The commodity brokers inform the Partnership, as with all of their customers, of the Partnership's net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions, and Ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the Partnership's potential net credit exposure, exchange by exchange, by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange, if any, to the Partnership's margin liability thereon.  Second, the Partnership's trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the Partnership's trading, usually over several different products and exchanges. Historically, the Partnership's exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and, on those relatively few occasions where the Partnership's credit exposure climbs above such level, Ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis, carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate. Material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than 50% of Units then outstanding.  Third, with respect to forward contract trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which Ceres, together with MS&Co., has determined to be creditworthy. The Partnership presently deals with MS&Co. as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts.  For additional information, see Note 4, "Financial Instruments" under "Notes to Financial Statements" in the Partnership's Annual Report to limited partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  Inflation has not been a major factor in the Partnership's operations.  Critical Accounting Policies.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of the Partnership's significant accounting policies is described in Note 2 to the Partnership's financial statements which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.1 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in Futures Interests and U.S. Treasury bills, as applicable. The fair value of exchange-traded futures, option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as inputs the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid prices received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of Futures Interests. The market-sensitive instruments held by the Partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and, as a result, all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets are at risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market-sensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activity of the Partnership.  The Futures Interests traded by the Partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk. Market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial instruments and commodities, factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership's open positions, and consequently in its earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and cash flow. Gains and losses on open positions of exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded forward contracts are settled daily through variation margin. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts and forward currency option contracts are settled . . .  Mar 28, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Dear Limited Partner:                                                           

This report summarizes the performance and trading activity for the Morgan      
Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P. (formerly, International Access Fund     
L.P.) during October.  The Net Asset Value per Unit as of October 31, 2000      
was $1,391.94, up 1.29% for the month.                                          

We are pleased to announce that DWFCM International Access Fund L.P. will       
be made part of the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Series effective         
December 1, 2000.  As a result of the fund becoming part of the Charter         
Series, it was renamed Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P. on         
October 11, 2000 and will now be open to new investment on a continuous         
basis beginning November 1, 2000. Investors may exchange units of one           
Charter Series fund for units of one or more other Charter Series funds as      
of a month end, without incurring any redemption fees or other charges.         

In connection with becoming part of the Charter Series, the fund's Limited      
Partnership Agreement has been amended in order to conform to the other         
Charter Series Limited Partnership Agreements.  Effective December 1, 2000,     
the following changes are also being made to the fund's fee and interest        
payment structure:                                                              

The brokerage commission will now be charged at a monthly flat rate 
fee equal to 7% of net assets on an annualized basis, rather than a   
transactionally based rate of 80% of Dean Witter's published rates for
speculative accounts capped at a maximum 9% annual rate.              

The management fee will be reduced from a 3% to a 2% annual rate.   

The fund will receive interest income on 100% of its assets, up from
80%.                                                                  

The quarterly incentive fee has been changed from 15% to 20% of fund
trading profits.                                                      

As a consequence of these changes, the fund's net recurring costs, based on     
its average volume of trading and on current interest rates, will be            
reduced by approximately 1.25%, to a break-even point of 3.45% from 4.71%.      
We believe that the reduction of net recurring costs and the simultaneous       
increase in incentive fee better align the fund's fee structure toward the      
objective of future profitability.  The specifics of these and other            
changes are set forth in the fund's Prospectus dated October 11, 2000, a        
copy of which you should have already received under separate cover.            

In order for the net asset value of the fund's units to be more in line         
with the net asset values of the other Charter Series funds, which were         
initially issued at $10 per Unit, the fund's units will be split 100-to-1       
effective with the November 30, 2000 monthly closing.  This will not result     
in any change in aggregate net asset value of the units held by a limited       
partner.  For example, if a limited partner held five units of the fund at      
the net asset value per unit of $1,350.00, these five units will be             
converted to 500 units with a net asset value per unit of $13.50.               

The General Partner believes that the foregoing changes will be beneficial      
to the limited partners.  Nonetheless, in view of these changes, limited        
partners are reminded that, subject to certain restrictions, they have the      
right to redeem their units on a monthly basis, and they may vote to take       
certain actions with respect to the fund's operations, as more fully set        
forth in Section 15 (c) on page A-22 of the fund's Limited Partnership          
Agreement, which is contained in the prospectus.

Monthly Report of the Trading Manager                                           
October 2000                                                                    

The Fund increased in value during October primarily as a result of gains       
recorded in the currency markets.  Gains were recorded from short positions     
in the Swiss franc, the euro and Swedish krona as the value of these            
currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar and British pound amid the           
absence of additional central bank intervention.  Trading profits were also     
recorded in the currency sector from short South African rand positions as      
its value trended lower due to a bomb blast in Cape Town, a weaker euro, as     
well as instability in the Middle East and Zimbabwe.  Additional gains were     
recorded from short positions in the Australian dollar as its value             
weakened relative to the U.S. dollar following the decline of the European      
currencies.  Profits were also recorded in the currency markets from short      
Japanese yen positions as the value of the yen decreased following the          
release of trade data and deflation figures, as well as the bankruptcy of a     
Japanese life insurance company which further exacerbated the state of          
bankruptcy debt in Japan.                                                       

A portion of these gains was offset by losses experienced in the energy,        
global interest rate and metals futures markets.  Losses resulted from long     
crude oil positions as prices dropped during mid-month after Saudi Arabia       
said OPEC could boost output again if prices remained too high.  In global      
interest rate futures, losses were recorded from long German bund and U.S.      
Treasury Bond futures positions as prices fell back after trending higher       
previously.  Smaller losses were recorded from long copper futures              
positions as prices declined early in the month after concerns mounted that     
demand would weaken amid a cooling of the U.S. economy.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                  

Organization - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P. (formerly,         
International Access Fund L.P.) (the "Partnership"), is a limited               
partnership organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of         
futures and forward contracts, physical commodities and other commodity         
interests, including foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals,         
energy and agricultural products (collectively, "futures interests").  The      
general partner for the Partnership is Demeter Management Corporation           
("Demeter").  The non-clearing commodity broker is Dean Witter Reynolds         
Inc. ("DWR"). Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. ("MS & Co.") and Morgan Stanley &      
Co. International Limited ("MSIL") provide clearing and execution services.     
The trading manager is Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc.           
("DWFCM").  Demeter, DWR, DWFCM, MS & Co. and MSIL are wholly-owned             
subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.                                

Demeter is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity of the      
Partnership and income (losses) are shared by Demeter and the Limited           
Partners based upon their proportional ownership interests.                     

On November 30, 2000, the Partnership will become available for new             
investment and series exchanges as a member of the Charter Series of funds.     

Use of Estimates - The financial statements are prepared in accordance with     
generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make      
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial     
statements and related disclosures.  Management believes that the estimates     
utilized in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and         
reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.                  

Revenue Recognition - Futures interests are open commitments until              
settlement date.  They are valued at market on a daily basis and the            
resulting net change in unrealized gains and losses is reflected in the         
change in unrealized profit (loss) on open contracts from one period to the     
next in the statements of operations.  Monthly, DWR pays the Partnership        
interest income based upon 80% of the average daily Net Assets for the          
month at a rate equal to the average yield on 13-week U.S. Treasury bills.      
For purposes of such interest payments Net Assets do not include monies due     
the Partnership on futures interest, but not actually received.                 

Net Income (Loss) per Unit - Net income (loss) per unit of Limited              
Partnership interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the weighted average         
number of Units outstanding during the period.                                  

Brokerage Commissions and Related Transaction Fees and Costs - The              
Partnership accrues brokerage commissions on a half-turn basis at 80% of        
DWR's published non-member rates.  Transaction fees and costs are accrued       
on a half-turn basis.  Brokerage commissions and transaction fees               
chargeable to the Partnership are capped at 13/20 of 1% per month (a            
maximum 7.8% annual rate) of the Partnership's adjusted month-end Net           
Assets.                                                                         

Operating Expenses - The Partnership bears all operating expenses related       
to its trading activities, to a maximum 1/4 of 1% annually of the               
Partnership's average month-end Net Assets.  These include filing fees,         
legal, auditing, accounting, mailing, printing and other incidental             
expenses as permitted by the Limited Partnership Agreement.  In addition,       
the Partnership incurs a monthly management fee and may incur an incentive      
fee.  Demeter bears all other operating expenses.                               

Redemptions - Limited partners may redeem some or all of their Units at         
100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit on the last day of any month, upon         
five business days advance notice by redemption form to Demeter.                

Distributions - Distributions, other than redemptions of Units, are made on     
a pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter.  No distributions have      
been made to date.                                                              

Income Taxes - No provision for income taxes has been made in the               
accompanying financial statements, as partners are individually responsible     
for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of each          
Partnership's revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
(Concluded)                                                                     

Dissolution of the Partnership - The Partnership will terminate on December
31, 2025 or at an earlier date if certain conditions set forth in the           
Limited Partnership Agreement occur.                                            

2.  Related Party Transactions                                                  

The Partnership pays brokerage commissions to DWR as described in Note 1.       
The Partnership's cash is on deposit with DWR, MS & Co., and MSIL in            
futures interests trading accounts to meet margin requirements as needed.       
DWR pays interest on these funds as described in Note 1.                        

Demeter, on behalf of all the Partnership and itself, entered into a            
management agreement with DWFCM to make all trading decisions for the           
Partnership.                                                                    

Compensation to DWFCM by the Partnership consists of a management fee and       
an incentive fee as follows:                                                    

Management Fee - The Partnership pays a monthly management fee equal to 1/4     
of 1% (a 3% annual rate) of the Partnership's adjusted Net Assets, as           
defined in the management agreement, as of the last day of each month.          

Incentive Fee - The Partnership will pay a quarterly incentive fee equal to     
15% of the trading profits earned by the Partnership as of the end of each      
calendar quarter.  Trading profits represent the amount by which profits        
from futures and forward trading exceed losses after brokerage commissions,     
management fees, transaction fees and costs and administrative expenses         
have been deducted.  Such incentive fee is accrued in each month in which       
trading profits occur.  In those months in which trading profits are            
negative, previous accruals, if any, during the incentive period will be        
reduced.  In those instances in which a Limited Partner redeems an              
investment, the incentive fee (if earned through a redemption date) is to       
be paid to DWFCM on those redemptions in the month of such redemptions.
