Although Mark Levin is known as a constitutional lawyer and a nationally syndicated broadcaster, he is, first and foremost, a dog lover. In 1998, he and his family welcomed a half-Border Collie/half-Cocker Spaniel they named Pepsi into their lives. Six years later, his wife and son persuaded him to adopt a dog from the local shelter, a Spaniel mix. It turned out he was older than originally thought, and he was the most beautiful dog they'd ever seen. They named him Sprite.

About The Show | MARK-CM











































































































































































About The ShowMark Levin has become one of the hottest properties in Talk radio, his top-rated show on WABC New York is now syndicated nationally by Cumulus Media. He is also one of the top new authors in the conservative political arena. Mark’s radio show on WABC in New York City skyrocketed to Number 1 on the AM dial in his first 18 months on the air in the competitive 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM time slot. Mark’s book Men in Black was released February 7, 2005 and quickly climbed to Number 3 in the nation on the New York Times Best-Seller list. When your book is endorsed by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, you know you have a winner on your hands. In a short period of time, Mark has become one of the most listened to local radio Talk show hosts in the nation.
Mark Levin took over the WABC 6:00 PM slot on September 2, 2003. Before that, he hosted a popular Sunday afternoon program. “He’s smart, witty, and fast on the draw,” according to WABC Program Director Phil Boyce. “He has this sharp sarcastic wit that can easily stun his opponents. I know I would not want to debate him.” Mark’s show follows the ever popular Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity on WABC, but everyday he manages to come up with a new twist on the day’s top news events, as well as his own unique information. His passion and intellect have made him a favorite of tens of thousands of radio listeners in the New York City area.
Mark has been a frequent guest and substitute host on The Sean Hannity Show, and has also been an advisor to Limbaugh, who frequently refers to him on the air with the nickname “F. Lee Levin.” He is perhaps more well-known for his nickname, “The Great One,” coined by his friend Hannity.
Mark Levin is one of America’s preeminent conservative commentators and constitutional lawyers. He’s in great demand as a political and legal commentator, and has appeared on hundreds of television and radio programs. Levin is also a contributing editor for National Review Online, and writes frequently for other publications. Levin has served as a top advisor to several members of President Ronald Reagan’s Cabinet – including as Chief of Staff to the Attorney General of the United States. In 2001, the American Conservative Union named Levin the recipient of the prestigious Ronald Reagan Award. He currently practices law in the private sector, heading up the prestigious Landmark Legal Foundation in Washington DC.

Background & Experience


Mark J. Levin is known for his work in complex commercial, insurance, and class-action litigation, with particular experience in consumer finance litigation, the structuring and enforcement of consumer arbitration clauses, and the defense of insurance companies in class actions. He testified in 2007 for the lending industry before a subcommittee of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee at an oversight hearing on whether mandatory arbitration in consumer contracts is fair to consumers. 
Mr. Levin has represented banks in defending against the first private class-action lawsuits under the Federal Trust Indenture Act, nuclear power plant owners in a year-long arbitration against an international insurance consortium, and school districts in a major funding lawsuit to recover state funds. He is currently involved in defending banks, other lending companies, and insurance companies in a wide variety of consumer class actions, including numerous class actions brought under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law. 
Representative Matters
Consumer Financial Services

Clerk v. ACE Cash Express, Inc., No. 09-05117, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7978 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, 2010), in which the federal district court enforced a consumer arbitration agreement containing a class action waiver because the consumer was given an unconditional right to opt out of the arbitration agreement within 30 days after obtaining her loan and, therefore, could not establish procedural unconscionability as a matter of Pennsylvania law  
Kaneff v. Delaware Title Loans, Inc., 587 F.3d 616 (3d Cir. 2009), where the Third Circuit upheld the validity of a class action waiver in an automobile title loan agreement and compelled individual arbitration of the plaintiff’s usury claims, holding that the class action waiver was not unconscionable under Pennsylvania law even though the plaintiff was seeking less than $900 in damages 
Jenkins v. First American Cash Advance of Georgia, Inc., 400 F.3d 868 (11th Cir. 2005), where the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a federal district court decision that had denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration on the ground that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable under Georgia law because it contained an express class action waiver 
Providian Fin. Corp. v. Coleman, No. 02-60943 (5th Cir. May 21, 2003) (per curiam), where Providian brought a declaratory judgment action in federal district court seeking to compel arbitration of anticipated claims by cardholders who had previously opted out of a class action against Providian and were threatening to commence new actions; the district court abstained and dismissed Providian's action, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that abstention was improper given the presence of important federal law issues arising under the Federal Arbitration Act 
Cappalli v. National Bank of the Great Lakes, 281 F.3d 219 (3d Cir. 2001), where the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court's order compelling arbitration of claims against Saks' credit card bank, which were brought under Sections 85 and 86 of the National Bank Act 
Murray v. Cross Country Bank, No. 05 C 1252, 2005 WL 2644961 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 15, 2005), where the federal district court held that Congress, in amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 2003, eliminated private actions against users of consumer reports under Section 615 of the FCRA and replaced such actions with administrative enforcement mechanisms 
Gipson v. Cross-Country Bank, 294 F. Supp. 2d 1251 (M.D. Ala. 2003), later op. 354 F. Supp. 2d 1278 (M.D. Ala. 2005), where the federal district court compelled arbitration of plaintiff's individual claims, dismissed plaintiff's class action allegations arising under the Fair Credit Billing Act, and rejected plaintiff's contention that the arbitration clause was unconscionable under Alabama law; in a subsequent action by the bank to enforce the order compelling individual arbitration, the court held that the court–not an arbitrator–has the authority to decide the "gateway" issue of whether an express class action waiver in a consumer arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable and that a court is authorized by Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act to intervene in an arbitration for the purpose of enforcing the express terms of the parties' arbitration agreement 
Kennedy v. Conseco, No. 00-CV-04399 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 11, 2001), where the federal district court held that evidence submitted by a credit card issuer and the presumption of receipt were sufficient to establish that a change in terms notice, adding an arbitration clause, was delivered to the consumer, notwithstanding the consumer's claimed inability to recall having received any such notice; in an earlier opinion in the same case, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17704 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 29, 2000), the court rejected all of the plaintiff's legal defenses to arbitration, including arguments that the clause was unenforceable because: (1) arbitration would interfere with her statutory rights under TILA; (2) arbitration was was too expensive; (3) arbitration was inconsistent with a class action proceeding; and (4) the change in terms notice did not comply with TILA 
Tsadilas v. Providian National Bank, No. 4948N, 2004 WL 2903518 (N.Y. App. Div. Dec. 16, 2004), review denied, (N.Y. Ct. App. 2005), where the New York Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's order compelling arbitration of plaintiff's individual claims arising under New York law and rejected the plaintiff's contention that the class action waiver in the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and that the arbitration provision could not be added to the cardholder agreement through a change-in-terms notice 
Rosen v. Saks Inc., 2003 Ill. App. LEXIS 1252 (Ct. App., 1st Dist. Oct. 8, 2003), review denied, 2004 Ill. LEXIS 142 (Ill. Jan. 28, 2004), where the plaintiff brought a class action lawsuit against Saks contending that the company violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act by charging tax on clothing alterations, Saks moved to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement that contained a class action waiver, the trial court denied the motion on the ground that the class action waiver was unconscionable under Illinois law and against Illinois public policy, and the Illinois Court of Appeals reversed, holding that such a clause is neither unconscionable nor against public policy, even though plaintiff's claims were small 
Providian National Bank v. Screws, 2003 Ala. LEXIS 298 (Ala. Sup. Ct. Oct. 3, 2003), where the Alabama Supreme Court held that Providian's arbitration provision was not unconscionable because, inter alia, cardholders were given the right to reject it without affecting the status of their accounts 
Boesch v. Best Buy Co., Inc., No. 1-97-0476 (Ill. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 1998), where the court dismissed (i) TILA claims brought against the retailer in a private label credit card program, in part on the ground that the bank, not the retailer, was the only entity required to make disclosures, and in part on the novel theory that the plaintiff could not challenge statement disclosures where the statute of limitations had already run as to the same disclosures in the agreement and (ii) state UDAP claims, in part on the ground that the retailer did not mislead customers into believing that it was extending credit, and in part on the ground that the bank had the right to export rates and fees under federal and Delaware law 
Parker v. SLM Financial, Inc. (No. 2418, C.P. Phila. Co., Feb. 7, 2005), where the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and denied plaintiff's motion for class certification on breach of contract and state UDAP claims based upon the plaintiff's deposition testimony that he had read and fully understood the loan documents and was not confused by them

Mr. Levin has also successfully defended insurance companies in federal and state courts in more than 15 class actions arising under automobile and homeowner's insurance policies and has also defended insurance companies in numerous complex individual actions, including claims for defamation, obstruction of justice, malicious prosecution, and bad faith. The legal questions posed in the class-action cases have included:

Whether an insurance company has a duty to pay the insured "undisputed amounts" prior to arbitration of the insured's UM/UIM automobile insurance claim 
Whether an insurance company, in addition to repairing a car that was involved in an accident, is obligated to pay the insured the car's so-called inherent "diminished value" resulting from the fact that it was involved in an accident 
Whether an insurance company has the right to charge retroactive premiums after the insured's UM/UIM automobile insurance coverage is increased retroactively 
Whether an insurance company properly provided statutorily required comparisons of the premium charges applicable to full tort and limited tort coverage 
Whether an insurance company's limited tort option form accurately described the automobile insurance coverage provided 
Whether an insurance company's UM policy requirement that when there is no physical contact between a hit-and-run vehicle and the insured's vehicle, the facts of an accident must be independently corroborated violates public policy 
Whether an insurance company is obligated to reimburse insureds who attend court proceedings at the company's request lost wages and travel expenses absent a specific demand by the insured 
Whether an insurance company failed to timely pay interest on overdue payments to doctors who treat its insureds, as required by the automobile insurance statute 
Whether an insurance company breached its homeowner's policy by failing to "match" partial exterior repairs to the undamaged parts of the exterior 
Whether an insurance company is permitted to depreciate the cost of automobile repairs in partial loss situations 
Whether an insurance company breached its homeowner's policy by refusing to make continuous repairs to roof and siding damage 
Whether an insurance company properly included general contractor's overhead and profit in actual cash value payments made to insureds on physical damage homeowner's claims 
Whether an insurance company properly paid proceeds to beneficiaries named in annuity policies 
Whether the court's denial of class certification requires remand of a case removed to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act

Biography[edit]
Mark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His father, Jack E. Levin, is the author of several books.[2] He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974.[3][4] After high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler including summer classes and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[5] Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes.[4] In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.[6] Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school.[4] He is Jewish.[7]
Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet, eventually becoming the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese; Levin also served as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education, and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior.[8]
He practiced law in the private sector and is president of Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm founded in 1976 with offices in Kansas City, Missouri and Leesburg, Virginia.[9][10][11]
Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families.[12] Levin is also involved with Troopathon, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas.[13]
In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award.[14] He was awarded the inaugural Citizens United Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC in 2014.[15]
Radio broadcasting[edit]




Levin speaks at the 2011 Defending the American Dream Conference hosted by Americans for Prosperity.


See also: The Mark Levin Show
Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as "F. Lee Levin", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Sean Hannity in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006.
Levin is known for his frequent use of the pejorative "moron" and "puke" for people he opposes.[16][17][18] Hannity has nicknamed Mark Levin "The Great One".[19] Levin and Hannity remain frequent contributors to each other's programs. He is a leading conservative commentator, ranked 4–6 position nationally among talk radio programs, with a minimum of 7.75 million total weekly listenership according to Talkers Magazine.[20]
On February 11, 2016, Levin signed a "lifetime" (nine-year) contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show to 2025, its 19th year.[21]
Writer[edit]
Men In Black; How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America[edit]
Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America (ISBN 9780895260505), in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have "legislated from the bench". In a review of Men in Black, Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers "to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'".[22] In her review of Men in Black, the Slate magazine's legal correspondent and journalist Dahlia Lithwick, a self-described liberal,[23] wrote that "no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book".[24]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish[edit]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish (ISBN 9781416559139) is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[25]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto[edit]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto (ISBN 9781416562856) was released on March 24, 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[26] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen's BookScan.[27] It came in at No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[28] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term "progressive" to describe "modern Liberals" and instead argues a proper term should be "Statist". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[29] Former federal prosecutor and fellow National Review Online author Andrew C. McCarthy wrote of Liberty and Tyranny in The New Criterion: "Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack" against "America's Leftist ascendancy".[30] Other reviewers critiqued the book as "analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape" while charging "Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism".[31][32]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America[edit]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America (ISBN 9781439173244) was released January 17, 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as "statist", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[33][34] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[35]
Jeffrey Lord, writing in the conservative American Spectator, called it "historical X-ray vision in book form".[36] Praise for the book came from PJ Media who reported, "That Levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the United States, but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history."[37]
On the other hand, The Atlantic's review criticized the book's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[38] and a review by Professor Carlin Romano in the Chronicle of Higher Education called the book "disastrously bad from beginning to end".[39]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic[edit]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic (ISBN 9781451606270), a book that suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments, was released on August 13, 2013. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in all three categories for which it qualified.[40] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review called the book "required reading for conservative bloggers".[41] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book "contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project" while noting "the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them".[42] In the Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as "the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution". Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]
Plunder and Deceit; Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future [edit]
Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future (ISBN 9781451606331), was released on August 4, 2015.[47] As of September 23, 2015, Plunder and Deceit was at the top the New York Times Bestseller list for several weeks.
Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism[edit]
Levin's book Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism (ISBN 9781476773087), was released on June 27, 2017.
Support for candidates[edit]




Levin and Ted Cruz at the 2017 CPAC conference


In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

Biography[edit]
Mark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His father, Jack E. Levin, is the author of several books.[2] He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974.[3][4] After high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler including summer classes and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[5] Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes.[4] In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.[6] Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school.[4] He is Jewish.[7]
Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet, eventually becoming the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese; Levin also served as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education, and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior.[8]
He practiced law in the private sector and is president of Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm founded in 1976 with offices in Kansas City, Missouri and Leesburg, Virginia.[9][10][11]
Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families.[12] Levin is also involved with Troopathon, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas.[13]
In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award.[14] He was awarded the inaugural Citizens United Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC in 2014.[15]
Radio broadcasting[edit]




Levin speaks at the 2011 Defending the American Dream Conference hosted by Americans for Prosperity.


See also: The Mark Levin Show
Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as "F. Lee Levin", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Sean Hannity in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006.
Levin is known for his frequent use of the pejorative "moron" and "puke" for people he opposes.[16][17][18] Hannity has nicknamed Mark Levin "The Great One".[19] Levin and Hannity remain frequent contributors to each other's programs. He is a leading conservative commentator, ranked 4–6 position nationally among talk radio programs, with a minimum of 7.75 million total weekly listenership according to Talkers Magazine.[20]
On February 11, 2016, Levin signed a "lifetime" (nine-year) contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show to 2025, its 19th year.[21]
Writer[edit]
Men In Black; How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America[edit]
Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America (ISBN 9780895260505), in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have "legislated from the bench". In a review of Men in Black, Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers "to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'".[22] In her review of Men in Black, the Slate magazine's legal correspondent and journalist Dahlia Lithwick, a self-described liberal,[23] wrote that "no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book".[24]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish[edit]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish (ISBN 9781416559139) is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[25]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto[edit]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto (ISBN 9781416562856) was released on March 24, 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[26] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen's BookScan.[27] It came in at No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[28] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term "progressive" to describe "modern Liberals" and instead argues a proper term should be "Statist". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[29] Former federal prosecutor and fellow National Review Online author Andrew C. McCarthy wrote of Liberty and Tyranny in The New Criterion: "Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack" against "America's Leftist ascendancy".[30] Other reviewers critiqued the book as "analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape" while charging "Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism".[31][32]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America[edit]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America (ISBN 9781439173244) was released January 17, 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as "statist", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[33][34] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[35]
Jeffrey Lord, writing in the conservative American Spectator, called it "historical X-ray vision in book form".[36] Praise for the book came from PJ Media who reported, "That Levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the United States, but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history."[37]
On the other hand, The Atlantic's review criticized the book's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[38] and a review by Professor Carlin Romano in the Chronicle of Higher Education called the book "disastrously bad from beginning to end".[39]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic[edit]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic (ISBN 9781451606270), a book that suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments, was released on August 13, 2013. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in all three categories for which it qualified.[40] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review called the book "required reading for conservative bloggers".[41] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book "contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project" while noting "the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them".[42] In the Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as "the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution". Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]
Plunder and Deceit; Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future [edit]
Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future (ISBN 9781451606331), was released on August 4, 2015.[47] As of September 23, 2015, Plunder and Deceit was at the top the New York Times Bestseller list for several weeks.
Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism[edit]
Levin's book Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism (ISBN 9781476773087), was released on June 27, 2017.
Support for candidates[edit]




Levin and Ted Cruz at the 2017 CPAC conference


In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

Biography[edit]
Mark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His father, Jack E. Levin, is the author of several books.[2] He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974.[3][4] After high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler including summer classes and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[5] Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes.[4] In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.[6] Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school.[4] He is Jewish.[7]
Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet, eventually becoming the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese; Levin also served as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education, and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior.[8]
He practiced law in the private sector and is president of Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm founded in 1976 with offices in Kansas City, Missouri and Leesburg, Virginia.[9][10][11]
Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families.[12] Levin is also involved with Troopathon, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas.[13]
In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award.[14] He was awarded the inaugural Citizens United Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC in 2014.[15]
Radio broadcasting[edit]




Levin speaks at the 2011 Defending the American Dream Conference hosted by Americans for Prosperity.


See also: The Mark Levin Show
Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as "F. Lee Levin", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Sean Hannity in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006.
Levin is known for his frequent use of the pejorative "moron" and "puke" for people he opposes.[16][17][18] Hannity has nicknamed Mark Levin "The Great One".[19] Levin and Hannity remain frequent contributors to each other's programs. He is a leading conservative commentator, ranked 4–6 position nationally among talk radio programs, with a minimum of 7.75 million total weekly listenership according to Talkers Magazine.[20]
On February 11, 2016, Levin signed a "lifetime" (nine-year) contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show to 2025, its 19th year.[21]
Writer[edit]
Men In Black; How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America[edit]
Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America (ISBN 9780895260505), in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have "legislated from the bench". In a review of Men in Black, Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers "to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'".[22] In her review of Men in Black, the Slate magazine's legal correspondent and journalist Dahlia Lithwick, a self-described liberal,[23] wrote that "no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book".[24]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish[edit]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish (ISBN 9781416559139) is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[25]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto[edit]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto (ISBN 9781416562856) was released on March 24, 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[26] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen's BookScan.[27] It came in at No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[28] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term "progressive" to describe "modern Liberals" and instead argues a proper term should be "Statist". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[29] Former federal prosecutor and fellow National Review Online author Andrew C. McCarthy wrote of Liberty and Tyranny in The New Criterion: "Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack" against "America's Leftist ascendancy".[30] Other reviewers critiqued the book as "analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape" while charging "Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism".[31][32]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America[edit]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America (ISBN 9781439173244) was released January 17, 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as "statist", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[33][34] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[35]
Jeffrey Lord, writing in the conservative American Spectator, called it "historical X-ray vision in book form".[36] Praise for the book came from PJ Media who reported, "That Levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the United States, but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history."[37]
On the other hand, The Atlantic's review criticized the book's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[38] and a review by Professor Carlin Romano in the Chronicle of Higher Education called the book "disastrously bad from beginning to end".[39]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic[edit]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic (ISBN 9781451606270), a book that suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments, was released on August 13, 2013. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in all three categories for which it qualified.[40] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review called the book "required reading for conservative bloggers".[41] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book "contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project" while noting "the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them".[42] In the Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as "the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution". Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]
Plunder and Deceit; Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future [edit]
Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future (ISBN 9781451606331), was released on August 4, 2015.[47] As of September 23, 2015, Plunder and Deceit was at the top the New York Times Bestseller list for several weeks.
Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism[edit]
Levin's book Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism (ISBN 9781476773087), was released on June 27, 2017.
Support for candidates[edit]




Levin and Ted Cruz at the 2017 CPAC conference


In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as "F. Lee Levin", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Sean Hannity in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006.
Levin is known for his frequent use of the pejorative "moron" and "puke" for people he opposes.[16][17][18] Hannity has nicknamed Mark Levin "The Great One".[19] Levin and Hannity remain frequent contributors to each other's programs. He is a leading conservative commentator, ranked 4–6 position nationally among talk radio programs, with a minimum of 7.75 million total weekly listenership according to Talkers Magazine.[20]

Writer[edit]
Men In Black; How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America[edit]
Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America (ISBN 9780895260505), in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have "legislated from the bench". In a review of Men in Black, Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers "to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'".[22] In her review of Men in Black, the Slate magazine's legal correspondent and journalist Dahlia Lithwick, a self-described liberal,[23] wrote that "no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book".[24]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish[edit]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish (ISBN 9781416559139) is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[25]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto[edit]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto (ISBN 9781416562856) was released on March 24, 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[26] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen's BookScan.[27] It came in at No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[28] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term "progressive" to describe "modern Liberals" and instead argues a proper term should be "Statist". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[29] Former federal prosecutor and fellow National Review Online author Andrew C. McCarthy wrote of Liberty and Tyranny in The New Criterion: "Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack" against "America's Leftist ascendancy".[30] Other reviewers critiqued the book as "analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape" while charging "Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism".[31][32]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America[edit]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America (ISBN 9781439173244) was released January 17, 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as "statist", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[33][34] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[35]
Jeffrey Lord, writing in the conservative American Spectator, called it "historical X-ray vision in book form".[36] Praise for the book came from PJ Media who reported, "That Levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the United States, but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history."[37]
On the other hand, The Atlantic's review criticized the book's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[38] and a review by Professor Carlin Romano in the Chronicle of Higher Education called the book "disastrously bad from beginning to end".[39]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic[edit]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic (ISBN 9781451606270), a book that suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments, was released on August 13, 2013. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in all three categories for which it qualified.[40] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review called the book "required reading for conservative bloggers".[41] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book "contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project" while noting "the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them".[42] In the Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as "the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution". Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]
Plunder and Deceit; Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future [edit]
Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future (ISBN 9781451606331), was released on August 4, 2015.[47] As of September 23, 2015, Plunder and Deceit was at the top the New York Times Bestseller list for several weeks.
Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism[edit]
Levin's book Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism (ISBN 9781476773087), was released on June 27, 2017.
Support for candidates[edit]




Levin and Ted Cruz at the 2017 CPAC conference


In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]

Levin and Ted Cruz at the 2017 CPAC conference


In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

Biography[edit]
Mark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His father, Jack E. Levin, is the author of several books.[2] He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974.[3][4] After high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler including summer classes and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[5] Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes.[4] In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.[6] Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school.[4] He is Jewish.[7]
Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet, eventually becoming the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese; Levin also served as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education, and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior.[8]
He practiced law in the private sector and is president of Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm founded in 1976 with offices in Kansas City, Missouri and Leesburg, Virginia.[9][10][11]
Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families.[12] Levin is also involved with Troopathon, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas.[13]
In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award.[14] He was awarded the inaugural Citizens United Andrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award at CPAC in 2014.[15]
Radio broadcasting[edit]

See also: The Mark Levin Show
Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as "F. Lee Levin", a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Sean Hannity in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006.
Levin is known for his frequent use of the pejorative "moron" and "puke" for people he opposes.[16][17][18] Hannity has nicknamed Mark Levin "The Great One".[19] Levin and Hannity remain frequent contributors to each other's programs. He is a leading conservative commentator, ranked 4–6 position nationally among talk radio programs, with a minimum of 7.75 million total weekly listenership according to Talkers Magazine.[20]
On February 11, 2016, Levin signed a "lifetime" (nine-year) contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show to 2025, its 19th year.[21]
Writer[edit]
Men In Black; How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America[edit]
Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America (ISBN 9780895260505), in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have "legislated from the bench". In a review of Men in Black, Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers "to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'".[22] In her review of Men in Black, the Slate magazine's legal correspondent and journalist Dahlia Lithwick, a self-described liberal,[23] wrote that "no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book".[24]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish[edit]
Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish (ISBN 9781416559139) is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[25]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto[edit]
Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto (ISBN 9781416562856) was released on March 24, 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[26] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen's BookScan.[27] It came in at No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[28] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term "progressive" to describe "modern Liberals" and instead argues a proper term should be "Statist". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[29] Former federal prosecutor and fellow National Review Online author Andrew C. McCarthy wrote of Liberty and Tyranny in The New Criterion: "Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack" against "America's Leftist ascendancy".[30] Other reviewers critiqued the book as "analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape" while charging "Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism".[31][32]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America[edit]
Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America (ISBN 9781439173244) was released January 17, 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as "statist", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[33][34] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[35]
Jeffrey Lord, writing in the conservative American Spectator, called it "historical X-ray vision in book form".[36] Praise for the book came from PJ Media who reported, "That Levin wrote this book now demonstrates not only his passion for the United States, but his awareness that he is a statesman defending natural law at a pivotal moment in human history."[37]
On the other hand, The Atlantic's review criticized the book's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[38] and a review by Professor Carlin Romano in the Chronicle of Higher Education called the book "disastrously bad from beginning to end".[39]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic[edit]
The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic (ISBN 9781451606270), a book that suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments, was released on August 13, 2013. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in all three categories for which it qualified.[40] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review called the book "required reading for conservative bloggers".[41] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book "contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project" while noting "the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them".[42] In the Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as "the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution". Also in the Times, Richard Rahn wrote "If "The Liberty Amendments" can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service".[43] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used "weak arguments".[44][45] Also in Forbes, Ralph Benko credited Levin with "notably and nobly proposing to change the rules of modern politics and governance".[46]

In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[48] After Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Donald Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the "Never Trump" camp.[49] He qualified his support by stating that, "I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say."[50]
Though known mainly for harshly criticizing liberalism and Democrats, Levin sometimes criticizes Republicans – including Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees on constitutional conservatism.[51]
Views on political issues[edit]
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act[edit]
In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used "police state" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin "voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower". Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[52] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and were reportedly the basis of the Trump Tower wiretapping allegations by President Trump.[51]
The Guardian writer Jason Wilson said used information about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants from outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. The Guardian confirmed that they previously reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI had sought a warrant from the FISA court in order to investigate four members of Trump's team who were suspected of having irregular contacts with Russian officials, but the FISA court turned down the application.[51][53] Heat Street reported in November 2016 that in October the FISA court had granted the FBI a warrant to investigate possible contacts between Russian banks and Trump's associates.[51][53]
Other issues[edit]
In 2009, Levin described as "absolutely right" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[54][55] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, "so Sarah Palin was right." The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[56][57][58][59]
Levin stated in 2013 that "the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood "sympathizer".[60][61] In 2015, Levin said that Obama had imposed “martial law” on the United States through his immigration, health care and law enforcement policies.[62]
In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of “seeking to destroy Israel” because "Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."
In May 2017, Levin said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was engaged in "blackmail" against Israel, by withholding the movement of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem as a bargaining chip against Israel, an allegation repeated on Levin's website Conservative Review.[63][64]
In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being “a radical Marxist who believes in violence.”[65][66]

Mark Levin hits 'Trump the globalist' on trade policy contradictions - Hot Air Hot Air




















































 






















 






























Mark Levin hits ‘Trump the globalist’ on trade policy contradictions
Larry O'ConnorPosted at 6:01 am on May 9, 2016

Share on Twitter

















Syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin has made a substantive and impressive argument against Donald Trump’s trade rhetoric. Unlike many of the recent criticisms of the New York billionaire (“he’s a carnival barker, he’s a fraud, he’s a maniac”) Levin’s criticism is based on Trump’s actual policies and it is argued from a position of solid, fundamental conservative principles.
This is an important challenge to the presumptive GOP nominee and it deserves serious discussion.
The essay published on Levin’s Conservative Review website raises the uncomfortable fact that despite his “protectionist adjacent” rhetoric during the primary campaign, Trump has personally benefited from the very free trade policies he now decries:
While Trump and his surrogates denounce free trade, proclaiming that they stand with and for America’s working men and women, they find it hard to explain away the billionaire’s own practices for most of his business career. As it turns out, Trump has never shown any qualms about using foreign labor, foreign capital and even foreign-owned companies to service his personal interests and acquire wealth.
Even a cursory examination of Trump’s business dealings reveals that playing in international markets is a matter of routine for him. The Donald J. Trump Collection brand shirts, eyeglasses, perfume, cufflinks and suits are made in low-wage countries like Bangladesh, China, Honduras, and Mexico to keep costs down.  And Ivanka Trump’s own product line imports 628 of its 838 items on offer.
Other Trump brand products such as shoes, ballpoint pens, soap and ties have been outsourced to China, Japan, Honduras, Brazil, Norway, Italy and Germany since 2006. And about 1,200 shipments of Trump brand goods have been imported into the United States by foreign companies since 2011.
It is easy for Trump enthusiasts to dismiss the criticism by saying “Sure, that’s back when Trump was a business man. Of course he took advantage of the policies. That’s what makes him so uniquely qualified to know exactly what’s wrong and what needs to be fixed,” but, as Levin points out, this goes far beyond that two-dimensional defense. The basis of Levin’s argument goes to core beliefs that conservatives have held firm on for several decades:
Remember, a tariff is really just a tax, the cost of which is imposed on the American people.  The higher the tariff, the higher the tax.  Imagine what a 45 percent increase in the price of goods made, say, in Japan would do to a middle class family shopping for a Toyota or Honda.   While Trump and his surrogates may have the money to pay the higher prices his policies would cause, many Americans – who are already having difficulty making ends meet – do not.
I’ve made these same arguments (though not nearly as effectively as The Great One) to Trump supporters who embrace his protectionist inclinations and their response always seems to be the same: “Ronald Reagan raised tariffs on the Japanese during the 1980s therefore, this is in line with Reagan’s trade policy.”
Here’s where Levin comes in, once again. You see, it’s hard to beat his pedigree when it comes to Reagan policies considering he was not only a member of the Reagan Administration, but also part of Reagan’s upstart 1976 campaign for president that almost upended President Gerald Ford’s efforts to earn the GOP nomination for president.
Supporters of protectionism, such as Breitbart writer Julia Hahn, point out that President Ronald Reagan imposed tariffs on imported goods from Japan, a fact I have mentioned on my radio program.  But her analogy between Reagan and Trump, like so many others asserted by Trump surrogates, is not really an apt one.  Reagan did not make wholesale protectionism and tariffs a central plank of his platform, as Trump does; nor did he support imposing high tariffs on every single product produced in a particular country.  Actually, Reagan emphasized the opposite.  Reagan’s tariffs were targeted, including on Japanese motorcycles and semiconductors, and usually in response to specific violations of trade deals.  Besides, Trump is a populist/nationalist/protectionist.  Reagan was a conservative.
These are challenging times for conservatives in America as we grapple with the most unconventional candidate we’ve seen in our lifetimes. As various factions determine the road ahead, definitive Hamiltonian proclamations of fidelity that suggest supporting Hillary Clinton is the best option for the Republican Party are met with concessions that a vote for Trump is necessary even if served with a healthy side of nausea.  Both arguments are worth our attention and contemplation.
But Levin is drilling down much deeper (and substantively) on a fundamental conservative principle and how it meshes with Trump’s stated policies (not to mention his past personal behavior.)  And isn’t this exactly what must be done between now and the GOP convention?
This is what makes Levin’s argument so important. His argument merely lays out the facts of Trump’s trade policies, shows how these ideas have been historically disastrous when put into practice, and challenges Trump’s own personal business practices compared with his stated policy goals.
This is not a #NeverTrump argument. On the contrary, Levin’s argument is forceful, but not intransigent. He concludes with,  “The fact that Trump’s political rhetoric runs directly contrary to his own globalist actions as a very successful and wealthy businessman requires a better explanation than he has given thus far. ”  In other words, you won the nomination Mr. Trump, but that doesn’t mean you automatically win every Republican’s vote, especially when some of your policies are so contrary to our fundamental beliefs. If you want our vote, it’s time to earn it. We’re listening.
