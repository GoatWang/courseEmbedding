                                    TA Associates to Acquire Majority Interest in NorthStar
                                

                                    Monday Feb 9, 2015
                                

TA Associates, a leading global growth private equity firm, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in NorthStar Financial Services Group, LLC, and its nine subsidiary wealth management industry service providers. NorthStar’s management team will remain significant owners following closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2015. Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
“NorthStar and its talented management team have created a platform that serves multiple channels within the global wealth management industry, from money management and pooled investment solutions to integrated technology and compliance services,” said M. Roy Burns, a Managing Director at TA Associates who will join NorthStar’s Board of Directors. “NorthStar’s compelling business model adds value for its clients, resulting in an excellent record of growth. TA Associates’ considerable experience in financial services enables us to offer strategic counsel and resources to augment NorthStar’s organic growth and pursue strategic acquisitions to build long-term value.” 
With approximately $275 billion in assets under management and administration, NorthStar provides a wide array of support services to registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent broker dealers (IBDs) and investment management firms. The company’s primary business units are CLS Investments, Gemini Alternative Funds, Gemini Fund Services, Gemini Hedge Fund Services, Northern Lights Compliance Services, Northern Lights Distributors and Orion Advisor Services. NorthStar has approximately 700 employees and is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, with additional offices in Hauppauge, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Mill Creek, Washington; and Scottsdale, Arizona.

                                    Alma Piscitello Joins Northern Lights Distributors As Senior VP Of Strategic Relationships
                                

                                    Tuesday Oct 14, 2014
                                

NLD has appointed Alma Piscitello as Senior Vice President of Strategic Relationships. In her new role, Ms. Piscitello will lead NLD's key accounts team, which develops and manages sales and marketing distribution plans and relationships for more than 100 investment advisers representing over 300 mutual fund strategies.
Ms. Piscitello is based in Hauppauge, N.Y., and will focus on enhancing the client experience across NLD and its sister companies within NorthStar Financial Services Group, LLC. In addition to creating and growing distribution relationships, she specializes in streamlining multi-matrix organizations so their different teams can work more closely to deliver holistic solutions to clients. 

"We are always seeking new ways to optimize the distribution and sales support we provide to investment advisers," said Brian Nielsen, Chief Executive Officer of NLD. "Alma's expertise and experience related to managing distribution relationships will help us and our colleagues across the NorthStar companies uncover more opportunities for advisers to grow their funds."

                                    Alt Mutual Funds Riding Momentum
                                

                                    Monday Sep 15, 2014
                                

Even as the SEC decided last month to put alternative mutual funds under the regulatory microscope, the investments are in a growth period as asset managers who offer the products seek to market their advantages to advisors and investors.
The SEC's broad examination of alternative mutual funds includes large and small players, but many industry experts do not believe increased scrutiny from Washington will affect their momentum going forward. The investments differ from other mutual funds since they have some hedge fund components to them including short selling, trading futures and utilizing derivatives.
Bill Wostoupal, president of Northern Lights Distributors, says his company has worked hard to set up meetings with advisors at industry conferences to educate about alternative mutual funds. The subsidiary of NorthStar arranged for three clients who deal in the space, Grant Park Funds, Horizon Investments and Princeton Funds, to hold breakout sessions at the recently held LPL Focus Conference in San Diego. Wostoupal added that some constructive conversations with advisors are often held outside a booth they set up at conferences like at LPL.
"We try to get fund companies we deal with opportunities to be in a setting to educate," says Wostoupal. "We want more advisors to understand this product and how it works."

                                    NLD Delivers Innovative Asset-Raising Solutions to Texa 529 College Savings Plans
                                

                                    Tuesday Jul 29, 2014
                                

NLD is collaborating with NorthStar Financial Services Group, LLC (NorthStar), in an agreement with the Texas Prepaid Higher Education Tuition Board to distribute three of the four Texas 529 college savings plans— the prepaid Texas Tuition Promise Fund®, the direct-sold Texas College Savings Plan®, and the adviser-sold LoneStar 529 Plan®.  
NLD’s sales and distribution consultants are applying their knowledge to enable these qualified tuition plans, which provide tax-advantaged, flexible and low-maintenance ways for individuals to save for higher-education expenses, to attempt to raise assets more efficiently and grow in a scalable manner. In addition to defining and implementing distribution and marketing plans for the investment vehicles the sales and distribution teams will advocate for the plans broker-dealers to facilitate selling agreements and identify receptive audiences of new investors.
“We look forward to working closely with the State of Texas to forge new broker-dealer relationships for its qualified tuition plans and bring these products to the attention of more retail investors,” said Brian Nielsen, Chief Executive Officer of NLD. “Our investment adviser roots give us the insight into the challenges that 529 plans face, and we will use our knowledge to provide Texas with innovative and strategic distribution solutions to assist achieving their long-term goals.”

                                    Good Harbor Shuffle Draws Trader Attention
                                

                                    Monday Feb 3, 2014
                                

Something odd happened during U.S. stock trading on Sept. 3: Shares of medium-size companies sank while the rest of the market rose, a finish that occurs about once every 100 sessions.
But to some traders, the unusual move wasn't a mystery. They had been watching for Good Harbor Financial LLC, a fast-growing money manager that deals in nearly $11 billion of exchange-traded funds, to reshuffle its main portfolio, as it does regularly on the first trading day of every month. That day, Good Harbor sold a big stake in the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF.
One month later, Good Harbor was buying midcap stocks. That day, midcaps rose faster than other parts of the market in a broad rally. Then on Nov. 1, the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell as other corners of the market rose. This time around, Good Harbor was unloading small caps and buying large-cap stock ETFs.
Across Wall Street, traders take note when big ETF managers like Good Harbor step into the market, moves that can affect prices. At times, they may try to profit by jumping ahead of Good Harbor, potentially chipping away at returns for its investors, people familiar with the market said.

                                    Tuesday Oct 8, 2013
                                

Northern Lights Distributors, LLC announced today the next phase of its online educational series detailing the main components of mutual fund distribution.
NLD has posted an interactive video and white paper in the Distribution 101 section of its website. These tools highlight how advisors can utilize Key Accounts Managers to boost the sales of their mutual funds.
“Key Accounts Management plays a vital role in the mutual fund distribution process,” said Jonathan Poyer, NLD Distribution Manager and the author of the white paper. “A dedicated Key Accounts Manager serves as an advisor’s first point of contact during distribution, providing industry guidance and creating and building home office channel relationships that are necessary for furthering investors’ access to a fund.”

Understanding the Nuances of Omnibus Accounts Alma Piscitello, SVP, Head of Strategic Relationships for Northern Lights Distributors was recently quoted in the Fund Operations article, “Understanding the Nuances of Omnibus Accounts”. The article discusses the rise of omnibus accounts in the mutual fund industry and how that has spurred a new operational role, one that focuses on intermediary relationships and fee structures in an intensely regulated environment.
“Managers are asking how intermediaries monitor these transactions, what kind of reporting they are doing, and how they comply with Rule 22c2,” Piscitello said. “Funds have a responsibility to ask the intermediary how they’re going to help. Investment companies still need to have policies in place to monitor trading activity, show the audit trail, and from a compliance point of ...Business Continuity 101 Business continuity planning has become an area of growing focus in the mutual fund industry as firms move away from the idea that continuity simply means staying in business during an outage and instead move toward the concept of business resiliency. 
“Business continuity several years ago was about location—it was regarding physical books and records and the ability to operate the organization and its physical infrastructure,” Alma Piscitello, head of strategic relationships at Northern Lights, said. “Fast forward, and it is now looked at through a technology and people-power perspective. It’s about information security and this approach of examining each individual’s continuity.”
Piscitello emphasized the importance of having the right people in place as part of a strong continuity plan. She ...SEC Guidance on Distribution Fees to Increase Oversight of 12b-1 Payments About Us
