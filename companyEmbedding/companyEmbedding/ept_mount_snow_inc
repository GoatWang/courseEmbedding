Peak Resorts, Inc. Announces Private Placement Of $20 Million Of Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock






GlobeNewswire



Aug 22, 2016 6:45 PM EDT













 


















































 "As we discussed previously, the Board thoughtfully considered multiple options to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and overall fiscal status," stated Steve Mueller, chief financial officer. "This transaction will ensure that we are properly positioned to manage ongoing operations and grow the Company's market share, both organically as well as through strategic acquisitions."  The proposed transaction is subject to fulfillment of certain closing conditions, including the reduction by the company's senior lenders, EPT Ski Properties, Inc. and EPT Mount Snow, Inc., in the additional interest reserve requirement related to the breakage of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Covenant. The proposed transaction also requires the approval of the Company's shareholders. At the annual meeting of shareholders, currently scheduled to take place at the end of October, the shareholders will be asked to vote upon the authorization of additional common stock, the authorization of blank check preferred stock and certain conforming changes to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the authorization of the transaction under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Assuming satisfaction of all conditions, the proposed transaction is currently expected to close in late October or early November. No investment funds will be received by the company until the closing of the transaction.  About Peak Resorts Headquartered in Missouri, Peak Resorts is a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded ski resorts in the U.S. The company now operates 14 ski resorts primarily located in the Northeast and Midwest, 13 of which are company owned, including Hunter Mountain, the Catskills' premier winter resort destination.  The majority of the resorts are located within 100 miles of major metropolitan markets, including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis, enabling day and overnight drive accessibility. The resorts under the company's umbrella offer a breadth of activities, services and amenities, including skiing, snowboarding, terrain parks, tubing, dining, lodging, equipment rentals and sales, ski and snowboard instruction and mountain biking and other summer activities. To learn more, visit the company's website at PeakResorts.com, or follow Peak Resorts on Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/skipeakresorts), Twitter or Instagram for resort updates.  Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements regarding the future outlook and performance of Peak Resorts, Inc., within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are discussed under the caption "Risk Factors" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as updated from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC.  Peak Resorts undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Exhibit 10.3
 

NOTE MODIFICATION
AGREEMENT
 
THIS NOTE MODIFICATION AGREEMENT (the “
Agreement ”) is made and entered into as of
October 30, 2007 (the “ Effective Date ”)
by and between PEAK RESORTS, INC., a Missouri corporation and
L.B.O. HOLDING, INC., a Maine corporation (collectively,
“ Borrower ”) and EPT MOUNT SNOW, INC., a
Delaware corporation (‘ ‘Lender
”).
 

WITNESSETH
 
WHEREAS, Borrower previously executed a
promissory note in favor of Lender dated April 4, 2007, in the
original principal amount of FIFTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS ($15,700,000.00) (the “ Note ”);
and
 
WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender have agreed to
modify the Note subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below.
 
NOW THEREFORE, by mutual agreement of the
parties and in mutual consideration of the premises and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree that the Note is modified as
follows:
 
1. Note Modification . Effective as of
the Effective Date, Section 3(b) of the Note is hereby
deleted and replaced by the following:
 
(b)  Annual Rate Adjustment . On
April 1, 2008, and on the first day of April of each year
thereafter (the “ Adjustment Date ”) until the
Maturity Date, the rate of interest shall be increased each year by
the lesser of the following: (x) three (3) times the
percentage increase in the CPI (as hereinafter defined) from the
CPI in effect on the applicable Adjustment Date over the CPI in
effect on the immediately preceding Adjustment Date, in each case
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent; or (y) one
and one-half percent (1.5%) (i.e., the rate of interest shall be
increased to an amount equal to the rate of interest in the
previous year multiplied by 1.015). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at such time as the Property achieves a Debt Service Coverage Ratio
of 2.0 to 1.0, and maintains such Debt Service Coverage Ratio for a
period of two consecutive years, then the applicable interest for
subsequent years will be reduced by 100 basis points from the
otherwise applicable interest rate, provided that such Debt Service
Coverage Ratio continues to be met at the end of each Loan Year (as
defined in the Loan Agreement). For the purposes hereof, Debt
Service Coverage Ratio shall mean a fraction, the numerator of
which is the EBITDA for the previous Loan Year for the Property
decreased by 3% of the revenues for the Property, and the
denominator of which is the current annual payment under this Note,
and EBITDA shall mean, for the period of computation, earnings
attributable to the Property before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied. For the purposes
hereof, “CPI” shall mean the Consumer Price
Index for all Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor
(base year 1982-84=100).

Exhibit 10.2

 PROMISSORY
NOTE
﻿

﻿




$10,000,000


 


September 1, 2016





﻿

For value received, Peak Resorts,
Inc., a Missouri corporation, and Mount Snow, Ltd., a Vermont
corporation (each a " Borrower " and, collectively, "
Borrowers "), jointly and severally promise to pay to the
order of EPT Mount Snow, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together
with its successors and assigns and/or any other holder of this
Note, " Lender "), without offset, deduction or
counterclaim, in immediately available funds in lawful money of the
United States of America, at 909 Walnut Street, Suite 200, Kansas
City, Missouri 64106, the maximum principal sum of TEN MILLION AND
00/100 DOLLARS ($10,000,000.00), or, if less, the principal amount
of this Promissory Note (the " Note ") advanced to or for
the benefit of either Borrower, together with interest on the
unpaid principal balance of this Note.  Capitalized terms
used and not defined in this Note have the meanings given to them
in the Loan Agreement (as defined below).






1. Payment .  The outstanding principal balance of the
Note and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall due and
payable in their entirety on the Loan Termination
Date.









2. Security; Loan Documents .  This Note evidences a loan made by Lender to
Borrowers pursuant to a Master Credit and Security Agreement of
even date herewith by and among Borrowers and Lender (as amended,
modified or supplemented from time to time, the " Loan
Agreement ").  This Note shall be secured as provided
in the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.




 





3. 
Interest Rate .    





(a)Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Note, the outstanding principal balance of
the Note shall accrue interest at a rate of nine percent (9.0%) per
annum.

(b)Notwithstanding the
foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any
Event of Default (as defined below), the outstanding principal
balance of this Note and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, all accrued but unpaid interest on this Note and any other
amounts payable by a Borrower under the Loan Documents, shall bear
interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum (the " Past Due
Rate ") equal to the per annum interest rate from time to time
publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., New York, New York as its
base rate, plus four percent (4%), but in no event shall the Past
Due Rate ever be less than the rate of interest set forth in
subsection (a) above plus two percent (2%).  If Citibank,
N.A. discontinues reporting a base rate, then the base rate shall
be such other base rate as Lender designates to be the successor
base rate.

(c)Interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of
days elapsed. 






4. Prepayment .  Borrowers' right and obligation to
prepay this Note are set forth in the Loan
Agreement.









5. Late
Charges .  If
Borrowers shall fail to make any payment under the terms of this
Note (other than the payment due at maturity) within fifteen (15)
days after the date such payment is due, Borrowers shall jointly
and severally pay to Lender on demand a late charge equal to four
percent (4%) of the amount of such payment.  Such fifteen
(15) day period shall not be construed as in any way extending the
due date of any payment.  The late charge is imposed for
the purpose of defraying the expenses of Lender incident to
handling such delinquent payment.  This charge shall be
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
amount





 




that Lender may be
entitled to receive or action that Lender may be authorized to take
as a result of such late payment.




Section 6 Certain
Provisions Regarding Payments .  All payments made
under this Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to late
charges, to accrued but unpaid interest, to unpaid principal, and
to any other sums due and unpaid to Lender under the Loan
Documents, in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole
discretion, any instructions from any Borrower or anyone else to
the contrary notwithstanding.  Remittances shall be made
without offset, demand, counterclaim, deduction, or recoupment
(each of which is hereby waived) and shall be accepted subject to
the condition that any check or draft may be handled for collection
in accordance with the practice of the collecting bank or
banks.  Acceptance by Lender of any payment in an amount
less than the amount then due on any indebtedness shall be deemed
an acceptance on account only, notwithstanding any notation on or
accompanying such partial payment to the contrary, and shall not in
any way (a) waive or excuse the existence of an Event of Default,
(b) waive, impair or extinguish any right or remedy available to
Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, or (c) waive
the requirement of punctual payment and performance or constitute a
novation in any respect.  Payments received after 2:00
o'clock p.m., central time, shall be deemed to be received on, and
shall be posted as of, the following business
day.  Whenever any payment under this Note or any other
Loan Document falls due on a Saturday, a Sunday or another day on

Mount Snow parent sells $20 million in stock to pay for growth, cites EB-5 delay and slow winter 





Tweet



  





 

Related Company: Mount Snow ResortVermont Business Magazine The parent company of Mount Snow Resort in West Dover, Peak Resorts, Inc. (Nasdaq:SKIS), has announced that it has reached an agreement to sell $20 million of its Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to CAP 1 LLC, a family client of Summer Road LLC. The Company expects to use the proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes and for the execution of its strategy for future growth, including expansion through acquisition.
Mount Snow Resort.
As previously reported by Peak Resorts, its current cash position is restrained due to delays in the release of funds raised pursuant to the EB-5 immigrant investor program, and the negative effects that unseasonably warm weather had on revenues during the 2015/2016 ski season. The Company believes that this investment will provide it with increased flexibility to meet short- and long-term liquidity and maintain flexibility for future funding of ongoing operations, growth and strategic investments.   
“We are pleased that our long-time shareholder, Summer Road, has decided to make this additional significant investment in our company,” said Tim Boyd, president and chief executive officer of Peak Resorts, Inc. “It is a strong validation of the quality of our assets and the opportunity in front of us. This investment will significantly strengthen our balance sheet, today and into the future.”
Key transaction details:
Preferred stock is convertible upon a change of control, or after nine months, into common shares equal to the number of shares to be converted times the liquidation value divided by $6.29.
Preferred stock has an initial nine-month, dividend-free period with a subsequent cumulative dividend of eight percent per annum on the liquidation value of $1,000 per share.
Preferred stock redeemable by the Company after three years at 125 percent of the liquidation value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends if the common stock trades at more than 130 percent of the conversion price for a 30-day period.
$1,000 per share liquidation value.
Preferred stock is senior as to dividends, liquidation and redemption, and there are limitations on the Company’s ability to issue convertible debt and senior securities.
Three warrants to purchase common stock at an aggregate $20 million exercise price, exercisable for 12 years: 
1,538,462 shares at $6.50 per share
625,000 shares at $8.00 per share
555,556 shares at $9.00 per share

Additional option, exercisable by the Company, to issue to Summer Road an additional $20 million in shares of Series A preferred stock, along with the same warrants and on the same terms and conditions, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions.
Summer Road also has certain additional rights, including pre-emptive rights, rights of first offer, director nomination rights and approval rights over certain changes in the business and certain acquisitions and divestitures.
Rory Held, senior vice president at Summer Road LLC, commented, “Peak Resorts has created a leading collection of regional drive-to ski resorts in the United States, each of which has a history of consistent visitation and profitability. The company has an experienced and proven leadership team with the skills to execute accretive acquisitions in an industry that has growing participation and limited new supply sources. The proposed transaction shows our support for Peak Resorts’ current and future growth projects.”
“As we discussed previously, the Board thoughtfully considered multiple options to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and overall fiscal status,” stated Steve Mueller, chief financial officer. “This transaction will ensure that we are properly positioned to manage ongoing operations and grow the Company’s market share, both organically as well as through strategic acquisitions.”
The proposed transaction is subject to fulfillment of certain closing conditions, including the reduction by the company’s senior lenders, EPT Ski Properties, Inc. and EPT Mount Snow, Inc., in the additional interest reserve requirement related to the breakage of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Covenant. The proposed transaction also requires the approval of the Company’s shareholders. At the annual meeting of shareholders, currently scheduled to take place at the end of October, the shareholders will be asked to vote upon the authorization of additional common stock, the authorization of blank check preferred stock and certain conforming changes to the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the authorization of the transaction under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Assuming satisfaction of all conditions, the proposed transaction is currently expected to close in late October or early November. No investment funds will be received by the company until the closing of the transaction.
