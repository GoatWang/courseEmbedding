Attorneys  Stephen P. Dunn





Mr. Dunn is a trial attorney focusing on business litigation.
He
prosecutes and defends business disputes.  His significant business
litigation experience includes business ownership oppression litigation,
employment litigation, sales representative commission disputes,
supplier-focused automotive litigation, and trademark infringement actions.
  He also serves as outside general counsel to numerous businesses and
business owners and advises corporate executives and boards on a wide variety
of matters.
Mr.
Dunn served as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for the Oakland County
Prosecutor's Office prior to joining Howard & Howard. He is also a
commissioned officer in the United States Army Reserve JAG Corps, where he has
served as a prosecutor and military magistrate for extended periods on active
duty in the U.S. and abroad. As a civilian and military prosecutor, Mr. Dunn
was lead trial counsel on dozens of jury and bench trials, attaining many
convictions.   
Mr.
Dunn received his J.D. from Wayne State University Law School in 2005 and his
B.A. (Phil), magna cum laude, from LeMoyne College in Syracuse, NY in
2002. He studied in Ireland at University College Cork.   He has completed
the U.S. Army Officer Basic Course, Officer Advanced Course, Basic Airborne
Course, Air Assault Course, and Command & General Staff College. 
 
Some
examples of recent successes include the following: In 2017, after more than a year of litigation in Federal court, Mr. Dunn obtained a settlement of $2,614,000 in post-termination payments for a commissioned sales representative client who was terminated by his automotive components supplier principle in violation of the terms of his written contract. In 2016, Mr. Dunn obtained
settlements of $1,700,000 and $1,200,000 for two different individual
shareholder clients, both of whom had been suddenly terminated and frozen out
by the majority shareholders of their respective companies. He also obtained offensive summary judgment for a plaintiff in a Federal
court trademark infringement action under the Lanham Act.  Additionally, Mr. Dunn obtained a settlement of over $2,000,000 net in favor of the Firm’s
Tier-1 automotive supplier client on its breach of contract counter-claim after
two years of Federal court litigation.  In 2015, Mr. Dunn served as trial
counsel on behalf of a Tier-1 automotive supplier in a five-week Federal court
jury trial that resulted in a jury verdict of over $2,000,000 net in favor of
his client on its breach of contract counter-claim.  In 2014, Mr.
Dunn obtained dismissal by summary judgment in favor of defendant companies in
a Federal court action brought under ERISA by a plaintiff seeking in excess of
$1,500,000, which was affirmed on appeal in 2015.  In 2010, Mr. Dunn
served as lead trial counsel for the plaintiff in a civil fraud case, which
resulted in a trial verdict of $2,905,000 in favor of his client, which was
affirmed on appeal in 2011.
