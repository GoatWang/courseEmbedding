Early life[edit]
Gregg Steinhafel was born in 1954 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His grandfather, a Prussian immigrant, founded Steinhafels Furniture in Milwaukee in 1934.[1][2] He began working in the store when he was in grade school, performing odd jobs. He graduated from Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin[3] and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1979, he was recruited as a merchandising trainee by Target, where he moved up the organization ranks. He became the Executive Vice President of Merchandising in July 1994 and became Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2008.[5] On May 2 2014, Target executives issued a "him or us" ultimatum[6] that forced Steinhafel to resign from his position as CEO on May 5, 2014[7] as a result of the data breach that affected 70 million to 110 million consumers.[8] His tenure as CEO of Target also included a disastrous expansion of Target into Canada in which the company lost $2 billion in 2 years. On top of the cost burden from buying out 220 leases of discount retailer chain Zeller's, the expansion was plagued by flawed execution, including inventory and restocking problems, poor locations and higher prices than Canadian shoppers expected. [9] Gregg Steinhafel received a severance package of $61 million and agreed to “remain employed by Target in an advisory capacity to assist with the transition through no later than August 23, 2014.”[10]
Steinhafel is also Director, Member of Nominating and Governance Committee and Member of Compensation & Human Resources Committee for The Toro Company and Vice Chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.[11]
Personal life[edit]
He attends Wayzata Community Church.[12]

Gregg W. Steinhafel: President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Target Corporation.


BIOGRAPHY:  Gregg Steinhafel was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His grandfather, a Prussian immigrant, founded Steinhafels Furniture in Milwaukee in 1934. Gregg Steinhafel worked in the store while he was in grade school. In 1977 he graduated from Carroll University. Two years later, in 1979, Steinhafel earned a Master’s of Business Administration from Northwestern University’s Kellogg Graduate School of Management. That same year he started his career at Target as a merchandise trainee and eventually progressed through merchandising and operation positions. In May 2008 he was named CEO of Target and then chairman of the company in February 2009. Steinhafel also sits on a variety of boards including Business Roundtable,the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the Minnesota Business Partnership, the Museum Council for the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, and TreeHouse, which is a nonprofit organization that supports at-risk teens. 







CHALLENGE DISCUSSION: Steinhafel takes part in the practice of business. He reached a standard of excellence when he was named Chief Executive Officer of Target Corporation in May 2008. A CEO is the highest-ranking corporate executive and the person in charge of the total management of an organization. Steinhafel was named a chairman, the main decision maker, and the president of the entire Target Corporation. He is in charge of more than 360,000 employees and must provide the public shareholders with a transparent company. As Chief Executive Officer, he is responsible for determining the strategy and clearly articulating priorities to execute effective and ensure continued success for Target Corporation. 

Large companies hold a great deal of power in the community and in the national economy. They control a large variety of assets and may have billions in cash at their disposal for socially conscious investments and programs. As the leader of Target Corporation, Gregg Steinhafel engages with team members, guests, shareholders, and communities in order to overcome challenges and to meet goals for environmental sustainability, education, volunteerism, and overall well-being. These processes are essential to the strength of communities in which Target Corporation operates worldwide. Steinhafel has also been on track to meet the goal of giving $1 billion for education by the end of 2015. 

“As we transform our business to meet competitive challenges and adapt to how our guests want to shop, we remain focused on our legacy of giving and service and our commitment to strong, healthy and safe communities. And in today’s era of unprecedented transparency around pricing and merchandising strategies, we believe it’s also important to be transparent in reporting our goals and progress around corporate responsibility,” (Steinhafel).

With the leadership of Gregg Steinhafel Target Corporation leverages their business strengths in order to meet the challenges associated with their determined goals. These goals aim to benefit both the company and the communities they serve. Target has been increasingly responding to the needs of these communities. 

“We continued to advance our commitment to responsible sourcing and environmental sustainability in 2012 by ending the harmful practice of sandblasting denim; working with our pork-product vendors to ban sow-gestation crates by 2022; committing to increase our organic food selection by 25 percent by the end of 2017; and making progress toward our goals of offering a 100-percent sustainable seafood selection in our stores and reducing waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2015. Additionally, we are working to cut excess miles from our U.S. supply chain, limit packaging waste, and help our guests increase their use of reusable shopping bags, which has reduced plastic-bag consumption in our stores over the past four years,” (Steinhafel).

Target was presented with a series of obstacles after the economic crisis began in 2008. Shoppers became more frugal and competitors such as Wal-Mart started to attack the company's core merchandising business. Since 1946, Target has given 5 percent of its income to non-profit organizations that support the communities where the corporation does business. With dipping sales figures, Steinhafel continued his processors promise of donating 5% of the company’s earnings to charity. This is significant in more ways than one. Firstly, this is a large contribution from a mainstream multinational corporation in a down economy. Secondly, Target Corporation is keeping a promise it made to the economy as a whole. It has been over 60 years since this promise was made and the company is still pursuing an effort to support the communities they are involved with. Steinhafel exhibits both leadership skills and ethical traits by acting as CEO in a strenuous marketplace and yet continuing to help the community. 

Despite his efforts to build a strong relationship with the community, however, Steinhafel has faced some challenges. Target had made a donation to MN Forward, a group who was in support of Republican Tom Emmer's bid for governor. Emmer is a known anti-gay conservative. The contributions to MN Forward prompted an attack from Democrats and gay rights groups who called for boycotts of the company’s stores.
This was a personal challenge for Steinhafel because his leadership and moral code were put into question. Rather than defending his decisions, however, Steinhafel took responsibility for his actions. 


He admitted his mistake and reaffirmed the company’s long-standing support for gay rights. Steinhafel also wrote a letter to Target employees stating that the purpose of his $150,000 donation was to support economic growth and job creation. He made a poor decision both ethically and financially though this donation. He supported a party that is against gay marriage and he lost the "gay friendly" title of his store. However, being a strong leader, he apologized and admitted his mistake. Some leaders try to fix their mistakes by lying or being deceptive about the underlying causes of the decision. Steinhafel admitted wrong wrote, "We rarely endorse all advocated positions of the organizations or candidates we support, and we do not have a political or social agenda...As you know, Target has a history of supporting organizations and candidates, on both sides of the aisle, who seek to advance policies aligned with our business objectives, such as job creation and economic growth...Let me be very clear, Target's support of the GLBT community is unwavering, and inclusiveness remains a core value of our company."
With all these challenges arising, Target has never lost sight of pleasing its customers nor wavered in its commitment to give 5% of earnings to philanthropic causes. Target was also able to create 30,000 jobs in Minnesota in the last 30 years. For CEOs there will always be many challenges to overcome. After business scandals like Enron, Arthur Andersen, and WorldCom, the corporate world today is in need of ethical business leaders. Through making considerate executive decisions, Gregg Steinhafel is one of the most ethical CEOs in Corporate America today. He has sustained value for the customers, employees, shareholders, and even the community. Steinhafel is responsible for Target's strong brand recognition, devotion to innovation, strong supply chain initiatives, and disciplined approach to managing its business and investing in future growth. Furthermore, he contributes executive decision-making skills and valuable strategic planning expertise, as well as significant and relevant knowledge of public company requirements and issues. 




Target Corporation Awards & Recognition



VIRTUE DISCUSSION: Integrity: Steinhafel practiced having good integrity by upholding his moral values. During the recession with dipping sales figures, he could have easily cut wages, downsized, or even falsified financial data that would have affected shareholders and employees. Instead, he held true to his community and organization and kept merchandise prices low unlike his competitors. By contributing 5% of income to donations, he continued upholding the company tradition that could have easily been stopped due to financial issues.


CHOICE-WORTHY GOOD: Steinhafel could have easily been like other unethical CEOs and could have been selfish. Instead he cared about his organization and the community and helped build a strong relationship between the two. Steinhafel demonstrates the choice-worthy good of being a partner of the community. As a CEO of any organzation, there is a large amount of monetary value that comes with it. With this said, Steinhafel could have left the organziation and still could have been financially stable the rest of his life. He also could have taken part in less ethical practices in order to gain more income. Instead, Steinhafel makes decisions based on both the needs of his company and the common good. It is through these decisions that he fights against the cultural ill of unethical business practices made by multinational corporations.

Marketing Plan



CEO:Gregg Steinhafel                        Directors: Roxanne S. Austin           James A. JohnsonCalvin Darden                   Mary E. MinnickMary Dillon                      Anne M. MulachyDerica W. Rice                Stephen W. SangerGregg W. Steinhafel        John G. StumpfSolomon D. Trujillo     The Target Corporation is one of the top ten largest retailers in the United States by sales. Target generated revenue through sales of apparel, electronics, housewares, and many other product operations such as the online service.      In January 2011, The Target Corporation took its first step in expanding outside of the United States with the purchase of 220 Zellers store in Canada. The plan is to convert 100-150 of these stores by 2013 or 2014. In hopes that Canada's revenue will be similar to those of the United States.     Walmart and similar Corporations are becoming more and more of a competitor. Target has always stood by their values and product. Thus, building a great one on one relationship with the customer, and expanding their number of traffic. With the constant competition of other companies Target had come up with several great marketing objectives with the hopes of out pacing the competitors. Target has now started REDcard promotions with its credit card program, which will hopefully increase its revenue. However raising commodity prices may offset the many gains Target may get.     Product-Target has a clear understanding of the needs of a large retailer. Target is constantly looking for ways to improve its product and services as well as always meeting the customers needs. This may happen by using several different manufacturer for products to avoid any issue with production, or by always looking for ways to show the customer that they stand by their Code of Business and uphold high expectations.     Price-All of Target's products are offered at a lower price and of better quality than most competitors.     Place-There are several Target locations accessible in the United States, and many more to come in Canada. All Target customer's can access a Target store within a few minutes drive or as quick as a click of a mouse for everyone's convenience.     Promotion-Target is famous for using television marketing to compare their variety of product and value of product to those of competitors. Target also utilizes many billboards in the higher populated cities across the United States. Many of the Corporate stores across the United States use the big Target symbol as marketing material to distinguish their Corporations.     Target plans to keep the momentum going, with expanding the Corporation overseas, and continually making the customer a priority. Target is also moving towards keeping the positive values alive and always coaching Team members of the expectation. These strategies will help Target continue to move in the right direction and make it extremely hard for competitors to catch up.     Target's budget is strictly managed and watched closely. Target's market cap as of October 2, 2012 is 41.64 billion, which is the highest it has been since 2010. Target has been and continues to grow an expand at a rapid rate, and will continue to do so as their company expands. http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Target_(TGT)http://ycharts.com/companies/TGT/market_cap

Early life[edit]
Gregg Steinhafel was born in 1954 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His grandfather, a Prussian immigrant, founded Steinhafels Furniture in Milwaukee in 1934.[1][2] He began working in the store when he was in grade school, performing odd jobs. He graduated from Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin[3] and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1979, he was recruited as a merchandising trainee by Target, where he moved up the organization ranks. He became the Executive Vice President of Merchandising in July 1994 and became Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2008.[5] On May 2 2014, Target executives issued a "him or us" ultimatum[6] that forced Steinhafel to resign from his position as CEO on May 5, 2014[7] as a result of the data breach that affected 70 million to 110 million consumers.[8] His tenure as CEO of Target also included a disastrous expansion of Target into Canada in which the company lost $2 billion in 2 years. On top of the cost burden from buying out 220 leases of discount retailer chain Zeller's, the expansion was plagued by flawed execution, including inventory and restocking problems, poor locations and higher prices than Canadian shoppers expected. [9] Gregg Steinhafel received a severance package of $61 million and agreed to “remain employed by Target in an advisory capacity to assist with the transition through no later than August 23, 2014.”[10]
Steinhafel is also Director, Member of Nominating and Governance Committee and Member of Compensation & Human Resources Committee for The Toro Company and Vice Chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.[11]

Early life[edit]
Gregg Steinhafel was born in 1954 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His grandfather, a Prussian immigrant, founded Steinhafels Furniture in Milwaukee in 1934.[1][2] He began working in the store when he was in grade school, performing odd jobs. He graduated from Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin[3] and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1979, he was recruited as a merchandising trainee by Target, where he moved up the organization ranks. He became the Executive Vice President of Merchandising in July 1994 and became Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2008.[5] On May 2 2014, Target executives issued a "him or us" ultimatum[6] that forced Steinhafel to resign from his position as CEO on May 5, 2014[7] as a result of the data breach that affected 70 million to 110 million consumers.[8] His tenure as CEO of Target also included a disastrous expansion of Target into Canada in which the company lost $2 billion in 2 years. On top of the cost burden from buying out 220 leases of discount retailer chain Zeller's, the expansion was plagued by flawed execution, including inventory and restocking problems, poor locations and higher prices than Canadian shoppers expected. [9] Gregg Steinhafel received a severance package of $61 million and agreed to “remain employed by Target in an advisory capacity to assist with the transition through no later than August 23, 2014.”[10]
Steinhafel is also Director, Member of Nominating and Governance Committee and Member of Compensation & Human Resources Committee for The Toro Company and Vice Chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.[11]
Personal life[edit]
He attends Wayzata Community Church.[12]

 Target’s CEO: Please STFU About Our Anti-Gay Donations / Queerty









 


























 


 














































GURL, SHUT UP Target’s CEO: Please STFU About Our Anti-Gay Donations

 By Daniel Villarreal June 9, 2011 at 7:06pm 



Gregg Steinhafel’s $23.9 million salary isn’t enough for the Target CEO to put up with your annoying-ass questions about his company’s donations to a Minnesota anti-gay candidate. When repeatedly asked about their anti-gay endorsement during this week’s annual shareholders meeting, Steinhafel said, “Does anybody have a question relating to our business that is unrelated to political giving? I would love to hear any question related to something else.”  
							


Then, when asked about their stance on Minnesota’s ballot amendment banning same-sex marriage, he said, “Our position at this particular time is that we are going to be neutral on that particular issue, as we would be on other social issues that have polarizing points of view.” 
Neutral. How very Swiss. 
Is neutrality even possible in a nationwide civil rights battle? Could any business or person stay neutral during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s? Either you think all races should be equal or you don’t—the same goes for queers. 
So… Target won’t be making ANY political donations then to ANY candidates ever again so as not to endorse pro or anti-gay political stances, right? And Target doesn’t care if its gay-coupled employees get financially screwed during tax season, just so long as they purport to be pro-LGBT by providing benefits to their queer employees under their own roofs, right? 
How very moderate. How very pro-nothing. How very… neutral.

Neutral isn’t neutral,  if you are staying neutral on a civil rights issue, then you are opposed.
As for him not wanting to answer questions…I find it interesting that this CEO feels he shouldn’t have to answer for a decision that he himself made.  How terrible that he is being questioned for his bigotry.







 

Steve
This is so not a big deal.  Let it go.
Target is a responsible company that does a lot of good for various communities.  I agree with Steinhafel: STFU already.







 

Mac McNeill
Steve either you’re straight or you just don’t give a crap about gay rights. Personally until Target mades a donation to gay rights for the same amount they donated to the loset then I’ll gladly and “gayly” shop somewhere else. And I’ll stfu but they won’t see a dime from me







 

PLAINTOM
Steve@ Giving money to people who oppose my equal rights is a big deal to me. I am not going to spend my money in an establishment that does not grant me simple respect.







 

JamesL
There was some poor judgment with their donation —  if nothing else, the donation wasn’t well-researched. But it was just $150K, and it only happened one time. It’d be one thing if Target was being consistently irresponsible in their philanthropy efforts and didn’t actively embrace diversity. But because Target has a strong record of donating to various positive causes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, I think it’s time to let the issue go. Sure, you can hang onto the knee-jerk reaction of being horrified, especially if all you care about centers on gay rights. But at least acknowledge their strong points.







 

Allen D.
Target can continue to fuck itself.  I haven’t shopped there since the original donation came to light.  Used to shop there all the time.  Fuck this guy.







 

tinkerbell
@JamesL: If I don’t care about anything but gay rights, I care about my life. I am stripped of first class citizenry based solely on the fact that I am gay. We are denied so much simply because of who we are. The rest I have worked for with my education, but some things we can’t overcome by profession.







 

J.
Steve, take your own advice and stfu.







 

Stacy
I have boycotted Wal-Mart for years for LOTS of reasons, and Target over this, so thank goodness K-Mart (owned by Sears) gets high marks from the HRC.







 

Jeffree
It’s easy to overlook that people at the shareholders’ meeting DID grill him on the issue. Whoever asked those questions deserves our thanks, because those meetings don’t always get that kind of vocal participation.
CEO-dude’s stance on “neutrality” is a two-faced lie, because the co.’s actions haven’t been neutral.
BigGayInc. seems to have dropped the ball here, or I am I missing something?







 

Rainfish
@JamesL:  No, JamesL, I do not care only about “gay rights”. I do, however, care very much for Human Rights. And since gays are human, then I make that also my top priority. If gingerphobia (fear/animus of red-headed people) got every hater and every political exploiter of hate all worked up enough to pass vile legal prohibitions relating to job protections and marital rights against red-headed people, I would not support businesses nor politicians who did not fully embrace the unimpeachable, constitutional right of red-headed people to be treated, without exception, as coequals in society. 
If Target remains “neutral” on human rights out of some misplaced fear of alienating toothless bigots who don’t shop there anyway, then I suggest that they really don’t know much about the majority of their customer base. Perhaps they think they are now Walmart maybe? If so, then lose the phony, edgey, genX commercial propaganda and adopt the Walmartism style of just pushing adult diapers, polygrip, bengay and Chinese slave labor plastic goods, accouterments, and attire.
While we all know, but hate to admit, that Target is not much better than Walmart in regards to pushing job-stealing off-shore foreign products, at least they tried to make us believe they took the spam out of the can first before putting it on the dinning room table. But class, like corporate integrity, is often just a self-serving charade. Still, one might expect that Target could at least pretend to like us a little while they’re screwing us out of a good portion of our weekly paychecks; instead, they demand we overlook their infidelity, and then they act all dismissive when we don’t.
Target has lost their cool factor; I doubt that they will ever get it back. Has anyone else noticed the demise of those kitschy commercials with the red and white little snacks of man-candy that Target used to incorporate in their TV adverts? I guess they realized that ambiguously gay market ploys are a waste of airtime for now. 
Yesterday Coors, today Target — who else will be on the losing side of history?







 

Alex
I unfortunately work at Target. I’m not sure how much of my experiences relate to work in general because it’s only my second retail job, but I do have some things to say.
While there is one mildly flamboyant gay guy on the team (better described as high maintenance, lol) my impression is that the work environment is very conformist-rewarding and individuality-suppressing…at least from the higher ups. It starts with a strict dress code; red top, tan khaki pants, belt for men, plain shoes. Individuals seem cheery but when I try to talk about my interests no one really gives a shit. Most just feel comfortable talking about the work and I think that says a lot.
It makes me feel like I sold out, the work robotic. I’ve got 7+ bosses and each has a different team leader “style” a.k.a. no consistency. They expect more from their employees and pay less. On paper they want us to take two breaks per x hours not counting lunch, but there is a lot of pressure to not take breaks and get the work done. For example, tonight I worked 4.75 hours and got one break near the end. We have to ask for breaks. I have been on my feet for hours “zoning” before and been denied a break until I finish a (big) section of the store. They keep mostly everyone part time under 31 hours so that they don’t have to give health benefits/insurance. Now they want me and other team members to sign up for some charity to garnish my wages when I hardly make anything to begin with ($8.25/hr). I don’t know of any full-time general team members. They are actively competing with Wal-Mart and redesigning store layouts as a result.
Most of the non-expendable products like furniture, dishware, home decor…it feels like low quality, but that’s not it…it’s that none of it has any personality. If you buy this mass produced stuff you become a mass produced person on the conveyor belt of life. Please shop somewhere else and support small business (online and offline). Look that much harder to find a unique piece of furniture or decor for your home. Buy groceries at local grocery stores. Buy hardware and home improvement stuff from hardware stores. Buy furniture from furniture stores, or thrift stores, flea markets, craigslist, or garage sales. Don’t buy it from Target or other Made-in-China stores.







 

Alex
I should also add that when us new Target hires were watching training videos, they had us watch one that was basically all about why unions are bad – cleverly disguised as being against a pending piece of legislation that would give employees power to unionize with simple majority. The thing is though…the video had nothing good to say about unions period. There was emphasis on union rules preventing colleagues from different departments from working together on the same tasks. “I’d love to help you lift that, but the new union rules don’t let me work in the warehouse at all.” The ending video message was something like “I want the power to choose whether to unionize or not, I want my voice to be heard, and this bill would take that away” all a bunch of buzzwords glossing over the fact that no Target employees are unionized at this time. Just another thing I found very telling of Target’s values – the bottom line!







 

Roman
Target, Steinhafel and other executives at the top have given generously to the most rabid anti-Gay Industry leaders and politicians who are hell bent on passing every anti-Gay law they can possibly shove down all of our throats.







 

Cam
@Steve: 
Steve, the donation went to a guy with ties to a group that says countries where gays are killed are more moral than America.  When asked to apologize or promise not to donate more to that guy the Target CEO refused until pressured.  Then he said it wouldn’t happen again and made ANOTHER donation.
If they had donated to a group that said women shouldn’t have the right to vote, would anybody be telling WOMEN that it was “No big deal”?  And yet we are supposed to think it’s no big deal that they donated to a guy with ties to a group believing that gays should be murdered?!







 

SteveC
The donations to these extreme right wing bigots by the Target board continue. 
Greeg Steinhafel and his henchmen on the Target board now donate to extreme bigots in the form of personal donations to avoid linking the donations to Target. 
Make no mistake, Target is a grossly homophobic organisation – they ‘inclusiveness’ is merely empty PR.
Boyoctt Target. Shop locally.







 

MAP
@Roman: 
thank you for pointing out the fact that the Emmer donation of $150K turned out to only be the tip of the iceberg for Target, and their executives, pattern of donations to politicians like Michelle Bachman who think that all of us are expendable human garbage.
I too haven’t shopped Target since the Emmer donation came to light–and I started shopping less overall and, as Alex suggested, shopping far more locally. My life is less cluttered, wallet less light, and my house smells a lot less like made in China plastic.







 

Shannon1981
Yeah not believing and not going back. Target and Chik Fil A are at the very top of my no go list.







 

The crustybastard
TUCK FARGET







 

pickles
Target seems to sell things we need. Or justify. Or think we need. But we don’t. I shop, basically, for a living. I spend money for projects for companies. Before the Emmers bullshit donation, I spent, according to my AMEX, between $3000- $5000 a year at Target. Since then, zero. There is a simple act to walking the walk. Do it. There is no way I’ll spend a dime there again. Period. And as essentially, a professional shopper, it hasn’t been hard at all. Use less. Avoid the assholes and spend your dollars places where they don’t actively work to hate you. It’s pretty simple- and deeply satisfying. 
I am very grateful that the person or people who had the guts to bring it up again at the shareholders meeting, did. That’s the way to make change. Anyone want to check in with Gold’s Gym??







 

gregger
@JamesL: Helloooooooooooooooooooo!  This piece of shit also was going to donate monies to pro-gay causes and backed out.  His company and their anti-gay horseshit was bad enough that Gaga terminated her agreement with them.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).
