Coors Light
Adolph Coors established his brewery in the Rockies in the 1870s. In 1978, Coors Light was born in the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, a setting that continues to inspire our brewing today.  Coors Light is always lagered below freezing and cold-filtered, resulting in brilliant clarity, and a clean, crisp taste. Coors Light is bottled cold and never heat pasteurized, which means you get the ultimate in cold refreshment, every time.
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hop Extract

Miller Lite
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Introduced in 1975, Miller Lite was brewed to be a great tasting beer that just happened to be light, not some lesser version of a full-calorie beer. While many other light beers have been developed over the years, Miller Lite remains the original, always upholding Miller’s commitment to “quality uncompromising and unchanging.” The Miller Lite recipe uses a unique blend of choice Saaz and Pacific Northwest hops and a significant amount of caramel malt. In addition, we are still proud to use the same strain of brewer’s yeast that Frederick Miller brought with him from Germany in the 1850’s. Our beer continues to be purposefully brewed for more taste, aroma and golden color than other light beers, with just 96 calories. 
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hops and Hop Extract

Miller High Life 
Miller High Life, also known as the Champagne of Beers, is a quintessentially classic, American-style lager. In 1903, Frederick Miller created Miller High Life because he believed that the good life, the High Life, should be accessible to everyone, not just the upper crust. To this day, Miller High Life continues to be faithfully brewed as a golden pilsner, utilizing light-stable galena hops from the Pacific Northwest and a select combination of malted barley.
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Maltose), Yeast, Hop Extract

Pilsner Urquell
Pilsner Urquell was first brewed in the city of Pilsen, Czech Republic, in 1842. As the original golden lager, its brilliant clarity, 24 karat golden color, spicy, bright Saaz hop aromatics and buttered fresh baguette malt character made it an instant success in a world that was accustomed only to dark, heavy, cloudy beers. Even the name Pilsner Urquell, which literally means "pilsner from the original source," acclaims its role in creating the most influential style of beer on Earth today.

Herman Joseph's Private Reserve
Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve is a German-style lager brewed by AC Golden Brewing Company and sold only in Colorado. Born of German heritage dating back to 1868, Herman Joseph’s recipe combines the finest European and North American hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley.  Each small, 30-barrel brew begins with a slow and easy 120-minute boil. Select ingredients are added at the precise moment to build its taste complexities. Each brew is then chilled to 1°C and allowed to rest for weeks on end. This chill-lagering develops each Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden lager that is appreciated for its distinctive qualities and unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Because of the extra time required to brew and age this rare beer, it takes us longer to craft Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve. We believe you will agree—it’s worth the wait.
 
Ingredients: Water, barley malt, yeast, hops

Blue Moon White IPA
Everyone has heard of an IPA, but what about a White IPA?  We’re known for our Blue Moon ® Belgian White, so making a White IPA really intrigued us. We first started with Wheat, Valencia Orange Peel, and Coriander. Then we experimented with hop after hop until we found a rare German hop called Huell Melon.  It complements the citrus flavor in the beer.  Ultimately, it’s Hoppy, Unfiltered and Well-balanced.  Blue Moon® White IPA is the best of both styles.

Colorado Native Amber
Colorado Native Lager is the only beer brewed with barley grown in the San Luis Valley, Rocky Mountain water, 100% Colorado-grown hops, and the oldest variety of brewing yeast in the state. Colorado Native Lagers are brewed with 100% Colorado grown ingredients. The majority of the barley used to brew other beers in Colorado comes from out-of-state malt houses and the majority of the hops used to brew other beers in Colorado comes from the Pacific Northwest, Europe and New Zealand. Colorado Native Lagers are Colorado’s homegrown beers.

We do not ship brewing ingredients into the state, our bottles are made in Wheat Ridge, our cans are made in Golden, and we do not sell our beer outside the state. All of this adds up to a smaller carbon footprint and a great-tasting, all-Colorado beer. If you care about locally sourced food and beverage, no other beer is more local than Colorado Native.

Colorado Native Double IPL
Colorado Native Double IPL is similar to Double IPAs, but it accentuates the unique Colorado hop character as only a lager can. Lager yeast doesn’t create the fruity esters and fusel alcohols found in ale yeast ... so the delicate hop notes shine through in the beer.  And Double IPL is all about the hops - 3 pounds of hops per barrel, 5 varieties and 95 BUs.

Colorado Native Golden Lager
Colorado Native Golden Lager is brewed for those who want a locally brewed, all-Colorado beer, but don’t want the overpowering malt and hops of other locally brewed ales and lagers.... It delivers more than the mainstream pilsners, yet remains perfectly balanced and drinkable. This Golden Lager delivers the full flavor of a fine import or craft beer, but with a great deal more drinkability.  Each brew begins with a slow and easy 90-minute boil. Select hops are added to build taste complexities and balance the malt sweetness.  After fermentation, each brew is crash-cooled to 1° Celsius and allowed to rest (lager) for up to four weeks. This Chill-lagering develops each brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden-copper lager that is appreciated for its unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Colorado Native IPL
Colorado Native IPL is a clean tasting, hoppy beer made with lager yeast (vs. ale yeast). We don’t believe the world needs another IPA. We do, however believe there is room for a beer that is similar to an IPA, but is one that highlights the hop character as only a lager can do…“An IPA done better”, if you will. To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an “IPA style” beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior in this case because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create ... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer.

Colorado Native Olathe
Whether it is fruits, vegetables, grains or hops, the fertile ground from Fruita to Palisade, down to Montrose, and from Paonia to Delta produces world class agriculture. To celebrate the harvest season, we brew this lager as a tip of the hat to those Colorado farmers who work the ground to feed us all.  To provide the backbone for this German-style lager, we mashed in Charles two-row winter barley, Moravian two-row barley and world-renowned Olathe corn. We added Crystal and Nugget hops; grown in Olathe, within a mile of the barley and corn. The resulting taste has a rich, malty honey character with cleaning bitterness.

Colorado Native Peche
Colorado Native Peche features Colorado’s world famous peaches. We combined this amazing fruit with some of the finest barrel aged sour beer made in Colorado.  Colorado Native Peche is brewed with Colorado pale, caramel, and Munich malts.  The resulting beer is then relaxed in used neutral wine barrels for nearly a year with our house culture of microorganisms.  The beer is then fermented on fresh Colorado peaches at a rate of two pounds per gallon beer.  The resulting beer is crisp and dry while still gushing with fresh peach flavor.

Colorado Native Pilsner
Colorado Native Pilsner is brewed with 100% Colorado grown and malted barley. Other Colorado breweries buy the majority of their barley malt from out-of-state malt houses.   To give Colorado Native Pilsner its clean, crisp, and amazingly drinkable character, we begin with our proprietary Moravian two-row barley. Estate grown Tettnang, Crystal and Mt. Hood hops are added to give this Pilsner its subtle floral and spicy aroma and balanced bitterness.  After brewing, we chill-lager the beer at 1º Celsius to develop its distinctive taste and crisp, clean finish. We believe you will find Colorado Native Pilsner to be a Colorado-inspired, one-of-a-kind interpretation of a classic beer style.

Colorado Native Plum
Colorado Native Plum is brewed with delicious Duarte plums grown in Palisade Colorado. The plums are a dark shade of mahogany that go perfectly with an amber sour beer made of pale and caramel malts we had resting in Colorado whiskey barrels with our house microorganisms.  The beer has a rich fruity flavor with some notes of vanilla and oak.  It went perfectly with the addition of plums at a rate of one and a half pounds per gallon. The resulting beer is a deep red color, dry and tart, but with a complex richness.

Everyone knows winter in Colorado is a wonderful time, especially around the holidays. The air seems crisper and snow covers the landscape like a natural gift wrapping. There’s just no other place like it. And that’s the feeling that inspired Colorado Native Winterfest. It’s our way of celebrating this special time of the year and toasting our friends in Colorado.  We brew Colorado Native Winterfest in September. We begin with our prized two-row barley, custom roasted to give the beer its rich, creamy flavor. Choice hops are added to create the aroma and festive taste. The finish is smooth, clean, sweet and rich with a depth of malt character.

Henry Weinhard's Woodland Pass IPA
Originally developed for British sailors stationed in India, IPAs were aggressively hopped to help prevent spoilage on long ocean voyages. Now that spoilage isn't as big a problem, we've eased up on the hoppiness just a hair to let the caramel malts shine through. It's a big beer with big flavor that really lets you appreciate hops in all their glory.

Herman Joseph's Private Reserve
Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve is a German-style lager brewed by AC Golden Brewing Company and sold only in Colorado. Born of German heritage dating back to 1868, Herman Joseph’s recipe combines the finest European and North American hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley.  Each small, 30-barrel brew begins with a slow and easy 120-minute boil. Select ingredients are added at the precise moment to build its taste complexities. Each brew is then chilled to 1°C and allowed to rest for weeks on end. This chill-lagering develops each Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden lager that is appreciated for its distinctive qualities and unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Because of the extra time required to brew and age this rare beer, it takes us longer to craft Herman Joseph’s Private Reserve. We believe you will agree—it’s worth the wait.

Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy
One day in 1922, Franz Kugler’s Munich tavern was flooded with 13,000 cyclists. Afraid the beer would run out, he mixed his Lager with lemonade, and the result was a hit. This soon inspired other beer mixtures like the shandy. Today, a shandy is beer mixed with a little something extra like soda, juice, lemonade or ginger ale. Leinenkugel’s® Summer Shandy® is our traditional Weiss beer with the refreshing natural lemonade flavor that makes it perfect for the sun-splashed summer months. For a fun and fresh food pairing, try it with lighter foods like shrimp quesadillas, pan-seared scallops with lemon vinaigrette, or lemon chicken with pasta.

Miller Lite
Miller Lite is the original light beer. Introduced in 1975, Miller Lite was brewed to be a great tasting beer that just happened to be light, not some lesser version of a full-calorie beer. While many other light beers have been developed over the years, Miller Lite remains the original, always upholding Miller’s commitment to “quality uncompromising and unchanging.” The Miller Lite recipe uses a unique blend of choice Saaz and Pacific Northwest hops and a significant amount of caramel malt. In addition, we are still proud to use the same strain of brewer’s yeast that Frederick Miller brought with him from Germany in the 1850’s. Our beer continues to be purposefully brewed for more taste, aroma and golden color than other light beers, with just 96 calories. 
Ingredients: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hops and Hop Extract

Pilsner Urquell was first brewed in the city of Pilsen, Czech Republic, in 1842. As the original golden lager, its brilliant clarity, 24 karat golden color, spicy, bright Saaz hop aromatics and buttered fresh baguette malt character made it an instant success in a world that was accustomed only to dark, heavy, cloudy beers.

5 Metrics for Measuring Inbound Marketing Success


Are you using the right metrics to measure and demonstrate the success of your inbound marketing efforts?






 By Jon Miller


Jon Miller leads strategy and execution for Marketo. Before co-founding Marketo, Miller was vice president of product marketing at Epiphany and held positions at Exchange Partners and Gemini Consulting. Miller holds a bachelor?s degree in physics from Harvard College and has an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

CREDIT: 










There are hundreds of possible inbound marketing metrics to choose from, and almost all of them measure something of some kind of value.  These include SEO rankings, inbound links, articles published, content downloads, reach (e.g. Twitter followers, Facebook fans, LinkedIn followers, blog subscribers), comments, retweets, Likes, shares, clicks, traffic, leads… and so many more.  (Check out the Marketo Social Media Tactical Plan for a list of over 100 social media and inbound marketing metrics.)
The problem is that most of these relate only loosely to the metrics that concern a CFO, CEO and board.  Of course, it’s okay to track some of these metrics internally within your department if they help you make better marketing decisions.  But be careful about measuring activity, not results. When it’s hard to measure business outcomes, marketers use metrics that stand in for those numbers: activity not results, quantity not quality, efficiency not effectiveness. Vanity metrics such as the total number of followers may sound good and impress people, but they don’t measure business outcomes or indicate how to improve marketing performance and profitability. This means resources and energy get allocated to potentially unproductive activities that don’t impact revenue.
The wrong metrics indicate that marketing is doing something, but they also produce questions about whether those are the right things to be doing - and ultimately whether marketing is having any impact on the financial metrics the C-suite cares about. That’s why it’s essential to push the team to use credibility-building financial metrics that show how marketing helps the company to generate more profits and faster growth than your competitors.
Here are the top five metrics that I use personally to measure and demonstrate inbound marketing success:

Month over month growth in organic website traffic, leads, and opportunities.  By organic traffic, I mean when people are finding your website by means other than paid promotion or emails you send; it includes social referral, organic search traffic,  and so on.  From there, track how much of that traffic turns into leads, and whether those leads turn into pipeline and revenue.  These are a great way to show that all the content, blogging, linking, and social outreach is actually impacting the bottom line.  Moreover, don’t just track the absolute level of these, but also track the trends so you can see how quickly you are going up - in a successful inbound marketing program, these will grow faster than your overall objectives and company growth rate. (Metrics such as organic rankings, inbound leads, and landing page conversion are good indicators that roll-up into success on this key metric, but are more relevant for marketing only.)
Social engagement, not just reach. Reach is defined as the total size of the audience you can reach, including your Twitter followers, Facebook fans, LinkedIn followers, blog subscribers, and email list. But the world is noisy, and just because someone follows you doesn’t mean they are engaging with your brand. Social engagement becomes even more important as prospective buyers use and learn on social sites more than email (a process I call “seed nurturing”). Fortunately, Facebook also reports on engaged users and a metric they call “People Talking About This” to show the total number of posts to your Page Wall, likes, comments, or shares on your posts; answers to questions, etc. This is important, since the more people talk about your page, the more your updates will show up on the main news feed for your fans. Other tools such as Feedburner show similar metrics for engagement, not just reach.
Lead generation by content, channel, and initiative.  Beyond core organic traffic and leads, track lead generation by content asset and source.  What sources are driving the most traffic? What kinds of content drive the most leads? The most revenue?  It can also be insightful to track how these vary by product line or business unit; at Marketo we find inbound marketing works better for lower price point products, for example. Measuring all this requires the ability to create landing pages and tracking codes for each asset, a capability provided by most marketing automation solutions.
Percent of leads with an inbound original source. With inbound marketing and content marketing, you’ll find that people first discover and engage with your brand via inbound channels, but they may not convert on that first visit, or even the second or third or more. When they do actually convert, they are likely get to your site using a different method such as direct URL entry.  That’s why it’s so important to know the “original source” of your leads - not the source of the visit that caused them to convert, but the source that caused them to first become aware of you.  (Again, marketing automation tools like Marketo can do this for you.) This is similar to display advertising, where it’s critical to measure not just “click through” conversion rates, but also “view through” conversion rates.  At Marketo, we find that a whopping 40% of our customers first met us by engaging with one of our content assets.
Forecasted conversion through the funnel. Your fellow C-suite executives don’t really care about the number of raw prospects or even leads Marketing generates; they care about pipeline and revenue. And they care even more about next month’s revenue than they do about what happened in the fast. After a few months of monitoring the trends of your inbound lead generation, you can start making forecasts about how much contribution inbound will make to future pipeline. This isn’t easy, but is probably the single most credibility-building thing you can do as a marketing executive.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORELove And War At Kent Stateby Miller, Jon MichaelDr. Jerry M. Lewis, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Kent State University writes: &quot;On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Kent State University students, killing four and wounding nine. This action contributed to the first nationwide student strike in higher education in the United States. 'Love and War at Kent State' by Jon Michael Miller relives the two and one-half year period from the Fall of 1967 to mid-May of 1970. Miller tells the story of the protest as well as the shootings through the experiences of a passionate love story of Jake Ernst, a graduate student in English, and Tasha Van Sollis, a French teacher in the local high school. As Jake struggles with personal relationships, he becomes involved in student protest against the Vietnam War. As a teaching assistant, he becomes a faculty marshal at various protests. He encounters the May 4 shootings in that role. Miller has told a creative and important story of the protest culture at Kent State. Readers of this novel will imagine themselves walking on the Commons area thinking about protest and the Vietnam War, and what these important events have meant to the United States.&quot;HistoricalCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
