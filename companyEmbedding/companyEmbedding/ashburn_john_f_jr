Largo Appoints John Ashburn to the position of Chief Legal Officer

Symbol: LGO (TSX.V)
TORONTO, July 8, 2015 /CNW/ - Largo Resources Ltd. ("Largo" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has appointed John F. Ashburn, Jr. Chief Legal Officer of the Company.  Mr. Ashburn is an executive with over 35 years' experience as a legal professional, 25 of which have been in the extractive industry.
Mr. Ashburn succeeds Andrew Hancharyk, who resigned as an officer of the Company effective June 30, 2015.  
Mark Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated "On behalf of the Largo team, I would like to welcome John and am pleased to be working with him here at Largo.  We at Largo are also grateful to Andrew and wish to thank him for his efforts and contributions to the Company, in particular during its ramp up phase."  
About Largo
Largo (TSX-V: LGO) is a growing strategic mineral company focused on continuing to ramp-up production at its Vanadio de Maracás Menchen Mine. 
Largo's Maracás Menchen Mine boasts the highest grade vanadium deposit yet discovered and is expected to be a low cost producer. With an off-take in place with Glencore, Largo is well positioned to become a leading producer of vanadium globally and is expected to generate substantial cash-flows.
Vanadium is primarily used as an alloy to strengthen steel and reduce its weight. Vanadium enhanced steels are used in a vast and growing range of products that are used and encountered every day; including, rebar, automobiles, transport infrastructure etc. With a compound annual growth rate of over 6% for the past several years (Roskill, 2013), vanadium is a bourgeoning commodity which lacks opportunities for investment in the wider market place. As trends in the steel industry now demand increasingly stronger and lighter products for advanced applications, the use of vanadium is expected to continue this growth over the medium and long term. 
Largo also has interests in a portfolio of other projects, including: a 100% interest in the Currais Novos Tungsten Tailings Project in Brazil; a 100% interest in the Campo Alegre de Lourdes Iron-Vanadium Project in Brazil; and a 100% interest in the Northern Dancer Tungsten-Molybdenum property in the Yukon Territory, Canada.
Largo is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "LGO".
