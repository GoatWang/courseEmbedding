JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC Launches Cushing® 30 MLP Index ETN (NYSE ARCA: PPLN)






Business Wire




Jun 13, 2017 2:30 PM EDT













 


















































  JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (JPMCFC) announced that today is the first day of trading on NYSE Arca of its JPMorgan Cushing ® 30 MLP Index ETNs due in 2037 under the ticker symbol PPLN. Any payment on the ETNs is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The ETNs are designed to track the performance of the Cushing ® 30 MLP Index, which we refer to as the Index, as measured by its VWAP level. The ETNs may pay a variable quarterly coupon based on cash distributions on the components of the Index, subject to the daily deduction of an investor fee of 0.95% per annum. The ETNs offer a weekly investor repurchase provision and will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the sole discretion of JPMCFC on any business day on or after December 15, 2017.  The Index tracks the performance of publicly traded equity securities of 30 U.S.-based companies that are engaged in, or that hold an entity that is engaged in, the midstream activities of transportation, storage, processing or production of energy commodities. These securities are chosen for inclusion in the Index according to a proprietary valuation model developed by Cushing Asset Management, LP that evaluates various financial criteria to rank potential companies for inclusion in the Index.  The Index was developed by Cushing Asset Management, LP, as index sponsor, and is calculated, maintained and published by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, as index calculation agent. The Index is reported on a real-time basis under the Bloomberg ticker MLPX.  An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. The ETNs may not be suitable for all investors and should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of investing in the ETNs. Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer of the ETNs, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the ETNs. Investors may lose some or all of their principal amount at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption. Investors are not guaranteed any coupon payments. The investor fee, and a repurchase fee deducted in the case of early repurchases, will reduce amounts payable on the ETNs. The payment at maturity or upon early repurchase or redemption of the ETNs is linked to the VWAP level of the Index, not to the closing levels of the Index. For further information regarding risks, please see the section entitled "Selected Risk Considerations" in the applicable pricing supplement and the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the applicable product supplement.

We are honored to have earned the support and confidence of JPMorgan Chase and look forward to growing this new relationship."

	Capped Buffered Return Enhanced Notes Linked to the Russell 2000

	®

	Index




	  



	 











	The following graph demonstrates the hypothetical total returns and hypothetical payments at maturity on the notes at
	maturity for a sub-set of Index Returns detailed in the table above (-30% to 30%). Your investment may result in a loss of up to 90% of your principal amount at maturity.


	 


	 







	How the Notes Work




	 




	Upside Scenario:




	If the Final Value is greater than the Initial Value, investors will receive at maturity the $1,000 principal amount plus a return equal to two times the Index Return, up
	to the Maximum Return of 25.00% at maturity. Under the terms of the notes, an investor will realize the maximum payment at maturity at a Final Value of 112.50% or more of the Initial Value.


	 





	●



	 


	If the closing level of the Index increases 5.00%, investors will receive at maturity a 10.00% return, or $1,100.00 per $1,000 principal amount note.




	 





	●



	 


	If the closing level of the Index increases 40.00%, investors will receive at maturity a return equal to the Maximum Return of 25.00%, or $1,250.00 per $1,000 principal amount note, which is the maximum payment at
	maturity.






	Par Scenario:




	If
	the Final Value is equal to the Initial Value or is less than the Initial Value by up to the Buffer Amount of 10%, investors will receive at maturity the principal amount of their notes.




	Downside Scenario:




	If the Final Value is less
	than the Initial Value by more than the Buffer Amount of 10%, investors will lose 1% of the principal amount of their notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than the Buffer Amount.


	 





	●



	 


	For example, if the closing level of the Index declines 50.00%, investors will lose 40.00% of their principal amount and receive only $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount note at maturity.




	The hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply

	only if you hold the notes for their entire term.

	 These hypotheticals do not
	reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower.




	Selected Risk Considerations




	 


	An investment in the notes involves significant risks. These
	risks are explained in more detail in the Risk Factors sections of the accompanying product supplement and underlying supplement.


	 







	●







	 



	YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS 





	The notes do not guarantee any return of
	principal. If the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than 10%, you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value by more than 10%. Accordingly, you may
	lose up to 90% of your principal amount at maturity.


	 







	●







	 



	YOUR MAXIMUM GAIN ON THE NOTES IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM RETURN,





	regardless of the appreciation in
	the Index, which may be significant.

	●







	 



	CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. 





	Investors are dependent on
	our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit
	risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.


	 







	●







	 



	AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS 





	As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our
	securities. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a
	result, we are dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related
	guarantee by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that guarantee will rank

	pari passu

	with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co.


	 







	●







	 



	POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 





	We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the
	notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.s economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in
	connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. Please refer to Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest in the accompanying product
	supplement.

	THE NOTES DO NOT PAY INTEREST.





	 







	●







	 



	YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS ON THE SECURITIES INCLUDED IN THE INDEX OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THOSE SECURITIES.





	 







	●







	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL CAPITALIZATION STOCKS 







	Small capitalization companies may be less able to withstand adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies.
	Small capitalization companies are less likely to pay dividends on their stocks, and the presence of a dividend payment could be a factor that limits downward stock price pressure under adverse market conditions.


	 







	●







	 



	LACK OF LIQUIDITY 





	The notes will not be listed on any securities
	exchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes are not designed to
	be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity.


	 







	●







	 



	THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF THE NOTES 





	The estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes exceeds the
	estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our
	affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement.


	 







	●







	 



	THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES DOES NOT REPRESENT FUTURE VALUES OF THE NOTES AND MAY DIFFER FROM OTHERS ESTIMATES 





	See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement.


	 







	●







	 



	THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE 





	The
	internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes is based on, among other things, our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing
	liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed-rate debt of JPMorgan Chase & Co. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms
	of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See The Estimated Value of the Notes in this pricing supplement.

	●







	 



	THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD 





	We generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in
	connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. See Secondary Market Prices of the Notes in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to
	this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).


	 







	●







	 



	SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE NOTES 





	Any secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market
	prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices (a) exclude selling commissions and (b) may exclude projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated
	hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the
	original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.


	 







	●







	 



	SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS 





	The secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify
	each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the level of the Index. Additionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes,
	which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market. See Risk Factors 
	Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes  Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors in the accompanying product supplement.

	The Index




	 


	The Russell
	2000

	®

	Index consists of the middle 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000E

	TM

	Index and, as a result of the index calculation
	methodology, consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000

	®

	Index. The Russell 2000

	®

	Index is designed to
	track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. For additional information about the Russell 2000

	®

	Index, see Equity Index Descriptions 
	The Russell Indices in the accompanying underlying supplement.




	Historical Information




	The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the Index based on the weekly historical closing levels of the Index from January 7, 2011 through June 24,
	2016. The closing level of the Index on June 27, 2016 was 1,089.647. We obtained the closing levels above and below from the Bloomberg Professional

	®

	service (Bloomberg),
	without independent verification.


	The historical closing levels of the Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be
	given as to the closing level of the Index on the Observation Date. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Index will result in the return of any of your principal amount in excess of $100 per $1,000 principal amount note,
	subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the notes.


	 







	Tax Treatment




	 


	You should review carefully the section entitled
	Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences in the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I. The following discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk &
	Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes.


	Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of
	our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as open transactions that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described in Material U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesTax
	Consequences to U.S. HoldersNotes Treated as Open Transactions That Are Not Debt Instruments in the accompanying product supplement. Assuming this treatment is respected, the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term
	capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any
	income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of prepaid forward contracts and similar
	instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss
	with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors
	should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the constructive ownership regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and
	impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates,

	any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with
	retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.


	Withholding under legislation commonly referred to as FATCA may (if the notes are recharacterized as debt instruments) apply to amounts treated as interest
	paid with respect to the notes. Under a recent IRS notice, withholding under FATCA will not apply to payments of gross proceeds (other than any amount treated as interest) of a taxable disposition, including redemption at maturity, of the
	notes. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of FATCA to the notes.


	Non-U.S. holders should also note that recently
	promulgated Treasury regulations imposing a withholding tax on certain dividend equivalents under certain equity linked instruments will not apply to the notes.




	The Estimated Value of the Notes




	 


	The estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of
	this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative
	or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding
	rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes is based on, among other things, our and our affiliates view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management
	costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for our conventional fixed-rate debt of JPMorgan Chase & Co. For additional information, see Selected Risk Considerations  The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an
	Internal Funding Rate in this pricing supplement.


	The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from
	internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include
	volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market
	conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.


	The estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may
	differ from others estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the
	future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.s creditworthiness,
	interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.


	The estimated value of the notes is lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are
	included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks
	inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in
	a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our
	affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits, if any. See Selected Risk Considerations  The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price to Public) of the Notes in this pricing supplement.




	Secondary Market Prices of the Notes




	 


	For information about factors that will impact any secondary
	market prices of the notes, see Risk Factors  Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes  Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors in the
	accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that
	will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances.
	This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a
	profit in connection

	with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See Selected Risk Considerations  The Value
	of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period in this pricing supplement.







	Supplemental Use of Proceeds




	 


	The notes are offered to meet investor demand for products
	that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See Hypothetical Payout Profile and How the Notes Work in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and
	The Index in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.


	The original issue price of the notes is equal to
	the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our
	obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.







	Validity of the Notes and the Guarantee




	 


	In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell
	LLP, as special products counsel to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co., when the notes offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by JPMorgan Financial and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the indenture,
	and delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such notes will be valid and binding obligations of JPMorgan Financial and the related guarantee will constitute a valid and binding obligation of JPMorgan Chase & Co., enforceable in
	accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation,
	concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith),

	provided

	that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions
	expressed above. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. In addition, this opinion is
	subject to customary assumptions about the trustees authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the notes and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee,
	all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated February 24, 2016, which was filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 by JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co. on February 24, 2016.




	Additional Terms Specific to the Notes




	 


	You should read this pricing supplement together with the
	accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying prospectus supplement, relating to our Series A medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and
	the accompanying underlying supplement. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the notes and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials
	including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, fact sheets, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the
	matters set forth in the Risk Factors sections of the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement, as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your
	investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before you invest in the notes.



	You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows
	(or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website):
