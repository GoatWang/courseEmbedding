                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Independent Advisers Leaving Wirehouses, Taking More Marketshare 
by
        
          Monica Mendoza 
        
        
July 14, 2017 — It just might be the fiduciary rule change that touches off a second wave of advisers fleeing big wirehouses, said Fred Taylor, president and co-founder of Denver-based Northstar Investment Advisors LLC.
He left the big wirehouse to form his own firm 22 years ago. 
"They might be thinking; how can I make it now? I’ll start my own firm and put the interests of clients first as a fiduciary,” Taylor said.








Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage Prior to Retirement?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
July 2, 2017 — "What if you still have a mortgage? Should you rush to pay it off?  Probably not if your remaining mortgage balance is more than 5 percent of your retirement savings. If you pull a big chunk of dough out of your retirement plan to pay off the mortgage, you may do more harm than good."







Which is the higher priority, retirement savings or college funding?

          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
June 18, 2017 — "If you survey financial advisers, most will tell you to fund your retirement first and then save what you can for your kids’ education.  The main reason is that there are many support systems available for funding college education."

Getting Student Loans? Link Borrowing to Your Expected Earnings to Find the Right Amount 
by
        
          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
May 21, 2017 — "Before you borrow, you need to estimate how much you’ll make from your venture. Only then can you figure out if you can support the debt payments. When most people hear this about college, they say, “I have no idea how much I’ll make.” And therein lies the problem. You’ve got to figure it out."

The Pros and Cons of Moving Closer to Your Children
by
        
          Glenn Ruffenach 
        
        
April 13, 2017 — Dividends can be a wonderful source of income in retirement. But retired investors, in particular—who don’t have a steady paycheck from a job—need a Plan B, says Charlie Farrell, chief executive officer of Northstar Investment Advisors in Denver.

“The key is to really think through how you would react to a big stock-market decline and how you will ‘bridge’ that decline,” he says.







Should You Jump Into the Stock Market Now?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell
        
        
April 2, 2017 — "If you’re trying to figure out the “right time” to get in or out of stocks, you’ll usually do yourself more harm than good. It’s essentially impossible to identify the major inflection points in markets."







How Much House Can you afford and Still Retire?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell
        
        
March 5, 2017 — "Here’s the problem: Lenders don’t think about how much you need to save for retirement. They look at your income and immediate expenses. Thus, in their lending formulas, money that should go to retirement savings goes to cover a higher mortgage payment."







Healthy Retirees Face Higher Medicare Costs Over Their Longer Lives
by
        
          Aldo Svaldi 
        
        
February 12, 2017 — Charlie Farrell, CEO of Northstar Investment Advisors in Denver, said Medicare does cost and needs to be planned for, but it is a manageable expense for most retirees.

“To me, the real risks are the costs not covered by Medicare, and this all falls into the area of long-term care, or what you might otherwise consider the cost of assistance with aging,” he said.







Do You Have the Stomach for Stocks?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell
        
        
February 5, 2017 — "At a certain level, successful investing is largely a psychological game. Do you have the guts to watch your stocks decline by 50 percent and stick with them? Famed investors Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch have told investors to ask themselves that question. Yet most people don’t."







How to Know If You’re Saving Enough for Retirement
by
        
          Rob Berger
        
        
January 18, 2017 — "Mr. Farrell wrote a paper back in 2006 that went into much more detail about how much savings (and debt) you should (and should not) have at various stages of your life. He’s also written a detailed book on the subject, called Your Money Ratios."







Thought Leader: Fred Taylor's making sense of money matters
by
        
          Justin Guerriero
        
        
January 6, 2017 — I would say nine out of 10 investment advisors today are managers of managers,” Taylor said. “They don’t manage stocks individually; they outsource the money management to other managers. That’s expensive for the client. In our case, I think our competitors’ clients are paying 30 to 50 percent more than what they would pay with us

December 22, 2016 — "The reality is that in most years, stock returns are positive and can serve as a source of distributions for retired investors. The problem is you can’t predict which years will be positive and you also have to accept the risk that stocks can fall significantly at any time."

November 9, 2016 — Pollsters predicted a Hillary Clinton win and her defeat Tuesday sent the markets scrambling overnight. Fred Taylor dubbed the surprising presidential results a “Brexit 2.0” — the British vote to leave the European Union in June where polls predicted it would fail.

“Nobody anticipated Trump winning — all the pollsters were wrong,” he said. “The one thing the market doesn’t like is uncertainty.”

by
        
          Monica Mendoza 
        
        
July 26, 2016 — Taylor and three partners, tired of being at the whim of the big firms, started their own firm in 1996, Northstar Investment Advisors. They started a new way of doing business — charging a fee, rather than working on commissions. The firm also built a custom portfolio to help clients to live on stock dividends.

“We took an old-fashioned approach and modernized it,” Taylor said.

          Charlie Farrell
        
        
June 1, 2016 — "If you are an investor, you pay attention to profits. Regardless of the GDP figures, if profits are shrinking, it's not good news for investors, whose success is based on the profits generated by the companies they own. If they don't generate profits, then the value of the business is eventually going to decline."







Is What Happens on "Billions" Myth or Reality?
by
        
          Fred Taylor
        
        
May 19, 2016 — "Shorting stocks is the single most-risky way to invest, simply because you don’t know what your downside risk is going to be. If you are long in a stock, it can only go to zero and you lose all of your original investment, but at least you know what that amount will be. If you sell a stock short and the stock continues to go up, there is no way to quantify your loss until you finally cover your short position."

          Fred Taylor 
        
        
May 3, 2016 — "Negative interest rates discourage banks from hoarding cash and in theory, stimulate lending to businesses and households instead. They also push investors into riskier assets by making bonds a much less attractive option."







Investors: How to know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em
by
        
          Charlie Farrell
        
        
April 6, 2016 — "This decision is more art than science, but we will generally sell a company if we have determined that there is a high risk of a fundamental change to the economics of the business.   This means we believe that the company's profits, and thus capacity to pay and raise dividends, have been meaningfully diminished for an extended period of time."

March 27, 2016 — “The only time a home is a financial asset is when you’re trading down,” Mr. Farrell says. “Certainly thinking about taking the equity that’s been built in a primary home and buying something else you can own debt free and with low expenses is smart.”

February 11, 2016 — Here’s the good news: if you start saving now, you will more than likely have more money in retirement than the generation right in front of you, Generation X, who are busy playing catch up with their retirement accounts after two brutal bear markets over the last 16 years.

          Fred Taylor 
        
        
February 4, 2016 — Could oil go as low as $20 a barrel? It certainly could, but commodities are a self-correcting mechanism. At some point in time, production gets cut to the bone, the oversupply gets used up, and prices stabilize.

by
        
          Laura Lee
        
        
December 11, 2015 — “The problem with the 60/40 model is that on 40% of your money, you really can’t build any real wealth. You have to consider inflation and then you have to take into account the taxes you have to pay on the interest you earn on those bonds. It becomes harder to get ahead,” says Charles Farrell, chief executive of Northstar Investment Advisors in Denver. 







Why Income and Patience Matter to Advisors - and Clients
by
        
          Danielle Andrus
        
        
December 1, 2015 — During the correction in late August, Taylor said, he got “very few phone calls” from uneasy clients. Part of that was because Northstar was proactive about reaching out to clients, he said, but “in 20 years, we’ve seen a lot. We’ve seen the Asian crisis, we’ve seen 9/11, we’ve had the tech-Internet blowup, we had the financial crisis, we had the debt ceiling crisis in August 2011. Clients have matured and have gotten more used to the ups and downs of the market.”

by
        
          Eileen Ambrose
        
        
November 1, 2015 — The Rule: At retirement, you should have 10 to 12 times your final salary in savings.

The Verdict: Thumbs Up

Along with Social Security, this should be enough to generate 70 to 80 percent of preretirement income for most people, says Charlie Farrell, chief executive of Denver-based Northstar Investment Advisors.

          Taylor Tepper
        
        
October 19, 2015 — It’s a good goal to own a home and have a rent-free home to live when you retire. If you don’t, your cost of living is going up every year, but you’re not building equity.”







Worrying about the Fed is a waste of time
by
        
          Charlie Farrell
        
        
October 16, 2015 — "While there is never just one reason for market movements, we think that the growing involvement of government entities (in the U.S., Europe and Asian markets) has exacerbated the recent sharp and irrational market movements. We expect it will continue as central planners now feel compelled to play out the hands they dealt themselves." 







Lessons from 20 years of investment management 
by
        
          Fred Taylor
        
        
October 7, 2015 — "The number of advisors who perform in-house research and select equities for their clients’ portfolios themselves is rapidly shrinking because of the time involved. Instead, many advisors have shifted towards picking managers and often have no idea what companies are in their clients’ portfolios because these portfolios are based on asset classes, not the underlying businesses themselves."







Denver execs weigh in on fed decision to hold interest rate steady
by
        
          Monica Mendoza 
        
        
September 17, 2015 — "If anything this shows that we are a global economy and it is important what is going on in the rest of the world," said Fred Taylor, president and co-founder of Northstar Investment Advisors, LLC. "Ultimately what happened a month ago with the devaluation of the yuan in China is what triggered the correction, and when the stock market fell August 24, the Fed looked hard at that."

by
        
          Walter Updegrave
        
        
August 5, 2015 — "Given your age, you should ideally have a bit more than three-and-a-half times salary, or roughly $400,000, socked away in retirement savings in order to be able to retire at 65 on 80% of your pre-retirement salary, according to the benchmarks in financial planner Charles Farrell's book, Your Money Ratios."







Greece has been holding the markets hostage - but not any longer
by
        
          Fred Taylor
        
        
July 30, 2015 — Why do the markets even care what happens to Greece? The concern stems from the possible domino affect or contagion that could occur if one weak member of the Eurozone leaves, and places the remaining 18 members at risk. If Greece can default on its debt obligations what prevents others who have borrowed a lot of money from doing the exact same thing?

May 4, 2015 — "For the 20 years that Northstar has been in business, we have advocated earning income from your investments in the form of dividends paid by individual companies. We prefer dividends because their returns are never negative."

May 3, 2015 — “When the oil industry experienced barrel prices in the $ 100 range, they expanded their debt, as they didn’t anticipate the downturn in 2014," said Fred Taylor, president and co-founder of Denver-based Northstar Investment Advisors.

Who We Serve





























Who We Serve

Individuals, couples and families

Investors seeking to grow their incomes

Those with a minimum of $ 1.5 million of investable assets








Sample Client Profile: Accumulating Assets

Working professional

Business Owner

Long investment horizon


These clients are working full-time, building wealth for eventual retirement.  The cash flow generated in the portfolios of this type of client is usually reinvested to build additional income.

  




Sample Client Profile: Taking Distributions

Retiree

Widowed


These are clients who are living off the money generated by their investments. As a result, their investment strategy might be more conservative and instead of reinvesting all of the cash flow produced in their portfolio, they will take a certain amount of that income in the form of distributions.
  




Sample Client Profile: Money in Transition

Divorced

Sold a business

Inherited wealth


These clients might have accumulated assets quickly through a business transaction or life changing event. They may intend to live off a portion of this wealth, while also investing for the future.

Northstar approaches business differently. We provide our clients with individualized attention, in-house technical expertise and a transparent fee structure that ties our success to that of our clients. 
Here is a closer look at what separates us from the competition:  

“Reputation is built up over many, many years of actually doing what you say you’re going to do and indeed, putting clients’ interests ahead of anything else.”
-Bob Van Wetter





Fiduciary Standard
As a registered investment advisor, Northstar operates under a fiduciary standard of care.  This means you are working with professionals who are dedicated to doing what’s in your best interest. 








Fee Only Advisor 
Northstar is also a fee only advisor, which means the only compensation Northstar receives for managing client portfolios are the investment advisory fees paid directly by our clients.  

Fees are based on the size of the client’s portfolio, and are generally paid on a quarterly basis.  
Northstar’s fees are directly related to how well we help our clients grow and protect their wealth.  We believe the fee-only relationship places us in direct partnership with our clients.
Money managed by Northstar is held by third-party custodians – usually large, national companies who provide our clients with a high level of security at very low costs. The third party custodian arrangement creates an important layer of protection for our clients as there is always an independent valuation of their assets.

 




Team Management 
When you work with Northstar, you have a relationship with our entire firm.  

A committee comprised of the principals of our firm and the firm’s portfolio managers oversee, research and set all of our investment strategies.
Clients work with a primary portfolio manager, who is responsible for the management of their accounts.  We also assign secondary portfolio managers to clients, so there are always two managers who are familiar with each portfolio.  
A team of service professionals is dedicated to the timely and accurate completion of the tasks needed to operate and service our clients’ portfolios. We pride ourselves on taking great care of our clients and their families. 















About Us / Values





























Our Values







You should work with a firm whose values about money reflect your values about money. At Northstar, we value careful, prudent and balanced solutions to money and wealth management. Here are some of the other tenets we value:


 
Trust. Successful investment advisory relationships are based on trust. You should know that investment advisors are required to adhere to a rigorous fiduciary standard of care when managing client assets. A core principle of the fiduciary standard is that investment advisors must put their clients’ interests first. At Northstar, we take this obligation seriously. We work hard to live up to our clients’ expectations every day.
Independence. You should expect your investment advisors to be independent and to form their own opinions about what investments are prudent and in the best interests of clients. Our belief is that independence comes from our ownership structure. Because the principals of Northstar own and operate the firm, we answer only to our clients and ourselves. We have purposely chosen this business structure so that we can deliver independent advice to you.
Expertise. Northstar is led by a team that understands the risk and return parameters of the financial markets and can offer prudent and careful guidance. You can review our backgrounds, education, credentials and writings to get a sense of our competence. In your interviews with us, see how we answer and explain our strategy. Does it make sense to you and do we have a command of what we are doing? We certainly believe we do, and strive to serve as leaders in our industry.




 
Responsiveness. As an independent advisory firm, we pride ourselves on providing direct, personal service to our clients. Our goal is to respond to client requests promptly, and to provide a high level of personal service through our Northstar team. 
Transparent Fees. Northstar is a fee-only advisor, meaning that the compensation we receive comes from the investment advisory fees we charge our clients. We do not receive commissions or outside compensation. Our fees are clear, transparent and competitive in our industry.

Northstar is a fee-only registered investment advisor. That means we charge an investment advisory fee to manage our clients’ money, and we do not earn commissions. The fee is based on a percentage of the assets in the account and is generally paid quarterly directly from the account. We believe this creates a straightforward relationship that is clear and transparent.  More about our fees »
What is a Fiduciary?
Northstar serves as a fiduciary on our clients’ accounts. That means it is our job to do what we believe is in your best interest. We are your advisor and our commitment is to take care of your investments on an ongoing basis. Thus, we manage, monitor and maintain portfolios in accordance with your objectives and needs.
Who Do I Work With?
Each client has a primary portfolio manager who serves as their main contact at the firm. Each portfolio manager works in collaboration with the investment committee to determine investment strategy and security selection. Additionally, all of our portfolio managers are here to help in the event your primary manager may not be available. We also have a well-trained and friendly support team that offers personal assistance for administrative and other non-investment related matters. We pride ourselves on providing prompt, personal service to our clients.  More about working with Northstar »
 




What is Our Investment Philosophy?
At Northstar, we follow an Income First Total Return Strategy® in our portfolios. Instead of trying to chase or predict random price movements for securities, our primary objective is to generate, grow and reinvest income from both stock dividends and bond interest. We call it Income First Total Return® because we think of the income first in our security selection process. This strategy is based on the time-tested financial concept that as a security produces more income, it becomes more valuable, so you can receive both price and income appreciation. We think the Income First Total Return Strategy® fits well with the objectives of personal portfolio management. Ultimately, most investors want to live off the returns from their portfolios, and the Income First Total Return Strategy® is a prudent way to help build assets, protect portfolios and create streams of distributable cash flow to support your lifestyle.  More about our strategy »
Is There An Account or Relationship Minimum?
In general, we have a new client relationship minimum of $1.5 million. The relationship minimum, however, may be subject to waiver or negotiation at our discretion.  
Who Holds My Money?
When you work with Northstar, your accounts are held at an independent, qualified third-party custodian. We work with large, well-known national custodians. Having an independent third party custodian serves to protect your money and creates an important separation between the party that holds your money (the custodian) and the party that manages it (Northstar). You receive monthly statements from the custodian and confirmations of trades made on your behalf. Northstar also generally provides its own separate set of semi-annual portfolio reports to help you better understand how your assets are allocated and managed.

InvestmentsOn one level the world of investing is quite complex. Your options as an investor seem endless and there is no shortage of conflicting information streaming to you from the 24/7 financial media machine. On another level investing isn’t really about options, but about how you will choose to approach the investment management process and your portfolio.   
Is it prudent to base your investment strategy and your financial future on factors that you can’t predict much less control or will you base your decisions on things you can control?
At North Star Resource Group we believe that the sole purpose of your portfolio is to support your financial goals and objectives. Whether you are looking to buy your first home in a few years, fund a college education or prepare for retirement there is a sensible approach and portfolio strategy that is optimal for you.
Successful investing isn’t a result of moving in and out of the market or by picking the investments which worked or yielded results of yesterday, but by adhering to time tested fundamental investment principles, even when and especially when it seems that everyone else isn’t.  
The most difficult thing about investing is traveling the road alone.  
There are many choices for you to make and a caring, competent advisor will prove to be most valuable to you as you navigate the inevitable bull and bear markets in the future.
Investments will fluctuate and when redeemed may be worth more or less than originally invested.

Jeff Landt, CFA, CFP®Vice President and Director of Investments

Jeff’s primary area of expertise is the investment management process.  He is available to assist North Star’s financial advisors with portfolio strategies, portfolio construction and the best practices of portfolio management. In addition to acting as the Director of Investments he is also a practicing associate with North Star Resource Group, specializing in retirement distribution and wealth management. He has been affiliated with North Star Resource Group since 1996.

Jeff is a Registered Representative and Investment Advisor Representative of Securian Financial Services, Inc. and CRI Securities, LLC.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Independent Advisers Leaving Wirehouses, Taking More Marketshare 
by
        
          Monica Mendoza 
        
        
July 14, 2017 — It just might be the fiduciary rule change that touches off a second wave of advisers fleeing big wirehouses, said Fred Taylor, president and co-founder of Denver-based Northstar Investment Advisors LLC.
He left the big wirehouse to form his own firm 22 years ago. 
"They might be thinking; how can I make it now? I’ll start my own firm and put the interests of clients first as a fiduciary,” Taylor said.








Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage Prior to Retirement?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
July 2, 2017 — "What if you still have a mortgage? Should you rush to pay it off?  Probably not if your remaining mortgage balance is more than 5 percent of your retirement savings. If you pull a big chunk of dough out of your retirement plan to pay off the mortgage, you may do more harm than good."







Which is the higher priority, retirement savings or college funding?
by
        
          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
June 18, 2017 — "If you survey financial advisers, most will tell you to fund your retirement first and then save what you can for your kids’ education.  The main reason is that there are many support systems available for funding college education."







Northstar President Fred Taylor Appointed Vice Chairman of Children’s Hospital Colorado Foundation Board 
by
        
          Northstar Investment Advisors 
        
        
June 6, 2017 — Northstar President and Co-Founder Fred Taylor has been elected vice-chairman of Children’s Hospital Colorado Foundation’s Board of Trustees. Taylor will serve a two-year term and provide support for chairwoman Laura Wright. 








Getting Student Loans? Link Borrowing to Your Expected Earnings to Find the Right Amount 
by
        
          Charlie Farrell 
        
        
May 21, 2017 — "Before you borrow, you need to estimate how much you’ll make from your venture. Only then can you figure out if you can support the debt payments. When most people hear this about college, they say, “I have no idea how much I’ll make.” And therein lies the problem. You’ve got to figure it out."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
