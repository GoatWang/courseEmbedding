Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. Completes Acquisition of CBD Hemp Oil Nutraceutical Developer GreenLife BotaniX Inc.
February 11, 2015 
Denver, Colorado - February 11, 2015 -   Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (OTCQB: MYHI) (“Mountain High” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has completed the acquisition of GreenLife BotaniX, Inc., a California-based developer and marketer of CBD hemp oil infused nutraceutical products (“GreenLife”).  As a result of the acquisition, GreenLife has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
“The rapidly growing nutraceutical market combined with recent changes in legislation regarding hemp and CBD, and the recent explosion of consumer and media interest in hemp and CBD products has created an incredible opportunity for companies that can successfully execute their business strategies in this new space,” commented Alan Smith, President of Mountain High.  “GreenLife’s strong and experienced management team is well on their way to capitalizing on this opportunity with a substantial current catalog of unique CBD hemp oil products and is poised to launch several more groundbreaking products in the near future.  Everyone at Mountain High is looking forward to working closely with Brent, Marcus, and the entire GreenLife team, to build GreenLife and their SuperCBD brand into a nationally recognized leader in CBD hemp oil nutraceuticals.” 
GreenLife BotaniX, Inc. is focused on the development and sale of products containing and featuring non-psychoactive CBD (cannabidiol) derived from hemp oil and sold under the retail brand name “SuperCBD”.   GreenLife currently features over a dozen CBD-based products on its e-commerce website www.greenlifebotanix.com, including four primary flagship products; “Super CBD Drops” - a high-potency vanilla flavored vegan hemp oil tincture, “Super CBD Lotion” - a CBD lotion made with a unique blend of CBD, eucalyptus oil, and vitamins and minerals, “Super CBD Lip Balm” - a medicated ointment intended for a variety of skin problems, cuts and rashes, and “Super CBD Pills” - a concentrated CBD dose in pill form for easy ingestion.
GreenLife obtains all its CBD from organic hemp grown exclusively for GreenLife’s products by a specialized hemp cultivator.  All GreenLife hemp is 100% natural, non-GMO, and grown without pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers.  GreenLife’s supplying partner utilizes state-of-the-art oil extraction methods coupled with what is believed to be the most rigorous testing regimen in the industry.  The hemp oil is lab-tested multiple times during the manufacturing process, from seed to shelf.  GreenLife hemp oil is also tested for yeast/mold/fungus and bacteria like E. coli to ensure safety and quality.  This combination of high quality organic source hemp, state-of-art oil extraction, and rigorous testing is intended to bring consumers the best hemp oil products on the market under the “SuperCBD” brand name.  Current and potential future sales channels for SuperCBD products include a strategic mix of online sales, brick & mortar distribution, dispensaries, liquor stores, boutiques, spas, large retail venues, and direct mail. 
The GreenLife management team includes Brent McMahon, President, and Marcus Daly, V.P. of Sales.
Brent McMahon brings over 27 years of business experience to GreenLife.  As CEO of Mega RV Corporation, he oversaw the generation of over $1 billion in retail sales.  He has supervised over 400 employees, created significant sales forces, worked with prominent financial institutions to establish peak credit facilities exceeding $60 million, and built agreements with some of the largest manufacturers in the US and Canada.  Mr. McMahon is also a dynamic public speaker, having led sales presentations and motivational seminars involving hundreds of sales consultants.
Marcus Daly brings over 17 years of experience in account management and business analysis for prominent national companies.  He served in national and global account positions for Southern Wine and Spirits, Allied Domecq, Jim Beam and E and J Gallo.  His experience encompasses a broad range of retail drug chain sales and account management.  He brings strength in corporate management collaboration, partnership building and innovative program planning, and achieving sales goals.  Mr. Daly received a Bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Los Angeles.
McMahon stated, “I am extremely excited to have GreenLife join forces with Mountain High to accelerate the growth and development of our already established CBD hemp oil nutraceutical business.  This transaction, we believe, will help fuel our future growth plans and allow us to better deliver the highest-quality CBD products to consumers, retailers, and wholesale distributors across the country.”
Alan Smith concluded, “CBD hemp oil and hemp based nutraceuticals appear to be two of the strongest components of the industry with a very bright future.  Mountain High intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of other complimentary businesses and assets in the hemp/CBD nutraceutical sector.”
Following the acquisition of GreenLife, there are a total of 38,142,000 common shares of the Company outstanding.  Mountain High Acquisition Corp. files reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission on EDGAR and anticipates continuing to file such reports.

Completes Acquisition of CBD Hemp Oil Nutraceutical Developer GreenLife BotaniX, Inc.MarketwiredFebruary 11, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER, CO--(Marketwired - Feb 11, 2015) - Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (  OTCQB :  MYHI ) ("Mountain High" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has completed the acquisition of GreenLife BotaniX, Inc., a California-based developer and marketer of CBD hemp oil infused nutraceutical products ("GreenLife"). As a result of the acquisition, GreenLife has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company."The rapidly growing nutraceutical market combined with recent changes in legislation regarding hemp and CBD, and the recent explosion of consumer and media interest in hemp and CBD products has created an incredible opportunity for companies that can successfully execute their business strategies in this new space," commented Alan Smith, President of Mountain High. "GreenLife's strong and experienced management team is well on their way to capitalizing on this opportunity with a substantial current catalog of unique CBD hemp oil products and is poised to launch several more groundbreaking products in the near future. Everyone at Mountain High is looking forward to working closely with Brent, Marcus, and the entire GreenLife team, to build GreenLife and their SuperCBD brand into a nationally recognized leader in CBD hemp oil nutraceuticals."GreenLife BotaniX, Inc. is focused on the development and sale of products containing and featuring non-psychoactive CBD (cannabidiol) derived from hemp oil and sold under the retail brand name "SuperCBD."  GreenLife currently features over a dozen CBD-based products on its e-commerce website www.greenlifebotanix.com, including four primary flagship products; "Super CBD Drops" -- a high-potency vanilla flavored vegan hemp oil tincture, "Super CBD Lotion" -- a CBD lotion made with a unique blend of CBD, eucalyptus oil, and vitamins and minerals, "Super CBD Lip Balm" -- a medicated ointment intended for a variety of skin problems, cuts and rashes, and "Super CBD Pills" -- a concentrated CBD dose in pill form for easy ingestion.GreenLife obtains all its CBD from organic hemp grown exclusively for GreenLife's products by a specialized hemp cultivator. All GreenLife hemp is 100% natural, non-GMO, and grown without pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers. GreenLife's supplying partner utilizes state-of-the-art oil extraction methods coupled with what is believed to be the most rigorous testing regimen in the industry. The hemp oil is lab-tested multiple times during the manufacturing process, from seed to shelf. GreenLife hemp oil is also tested for yeast/mold/fungus and bacteria like E. coli to ensure safety and quality. This combination of high quality organic source hemp, state-of-art oil extraction, and rigorous testing is intended to bring consumers the best hemp oil products on the market under the "SuperCBD" brand name. Current and potential future sales channels for SuperCBD products include a strategic mix of online sales, brick & mortar distribution, dispensaries, liquor stores, boutiques, spas, large retail venues, and direct mail.The GreenLife management team includes Brent McMahon, President, and Marcus Daly, V.P. of Sales. Brent McMahon brings over 27 years of business experience to GreenLife. As CEO of Mega RV Corporation, he oversaw the generation of over $1 billion in retail sales. He has supervised over 400 employees, created significant sales forces, worked with prominent financial institutions to establish peak credit facilities exceeding $60 million, and built agreements with some of the largest manufacturers in the US and Canada. Mr. McMahon is also a dynamic public speaker, having led sales presentations and motivational seminars involving hundreds of sales consultants. Marcus Daly brings over 17 years of experience in account management and business analysis for prominent national companies. He served in national and global account positions for Southern Wine and Spirits, Allied Domecq, Jim Beam and E and J Gallo. His experience encompasses a broad range of retail drug chain sales and account management. He brings strength in corporate management collaboration, partnership building and innovative program planning, and achieving sales goals. Mr. Daly received a Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. McMahon stated, "I am extremely excited to have GreenLife join forces with Mountain High to accelerate the growth and development of our already established CBD hemp oil nutraceutical business. This transaction, we believe, will help fuel our future growth plans and allow us to better deliver the highest-quality CBD products to consumers, retailers, and wholesale distributors across the country."Alan Smith concluded, "CBD hemp oil and hemp based nutraceuticals appear to be two of the strongest components of the industry with a very bright future. Mountain High intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of other complimentary businesses and assets in the hemp/CBD nutraceutical sector." Following the acquisition of GreenLife, there are a total of 38,142,000 common shares of the Company outstanding. Mountain High Acquisition Corp. files reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission on EDGAR and anticipates continuing to file such reports. The Company's filings can be viewed at www.sec.gov, including the Company's most recent Form 8-K filing describing the Company's acquisition of GreenLife BotaniX, Inc. About Mountain High Acquisitions Corp.

Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. Rolls Out Pilot Program Aimed At Helping Licensed Cannabis Growers Overcome A Key Challenge--Financing Startup Infrastructure Costs









PR Newswire




Jul 6, 2017 8:10 AM EDT













 




























































  DENVER, July 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MOUNTAIN HIGH ACQUISITIONS CORP (OTCQB: MYHI) announces that together with D9 Manufacturing, Inc. it is launching a pilot project aimed at proving a turnkey infrastructure model MYHI intends to roll out in highly promising cannabis markets such as California, Washington and Arizona.  The objective is to help licensed cannabis growers overcome the key business challenge of financing steep startup infrastructure costs.  To initiate the project, MYHI has acquired two state-of-the-art intermodal containers engineered and designed specifically for growing cannabis.  The opportunity to acquire the grow containers was presented to MYHI by D9 Manufacturing, Inc., an Arizona based company that offers a wide variety of engineering, manufacturing and consulting services to the cannabis sector.  On May 30, MYHI announced the engagement of D9 to assist in the identification, acquisition and development of infrastructure opportunities in the cannabis market. "We are very enthusiastic about pursuing this opportunity, and appreciate what D9 has brought to the table so quickly. The solutions we intend to provide to the cannabis industry solve real problems faced by licensed growers and producers.  Having a license is not a guarantee of success.  A grower needs infrastructure and equipment that maximizes the quantity and quality of their production—and all of that can be expensive," said MYHI CEO Alan Smith. "That's where we come in.  By providing swift access to affordable turnkey solutions not only do we greatly reduce setup time and costs and help growers get growing, we also help them to minimize risk and optimize their business."    As a part of this initial pilot, MYHI will lease its first two containers to D9 for use in licensed grow operations in Arizona and California.  Grow operations in the containers are expected to begin within 30 days.  Initial harvests are anticipated to occur 90 days later. This particular pilot project will allow the company to test both the revenue model—acquiring and leasing infrastructure solutions to licensed growers—and the equipment itself.  In this case the equipment being leased out consists of intermodal containers that can be geared for cultivation or for extraction depending upon how the container is built out.

Cannabis Product Development Goes Mainstream as Focus Shifts GloballyBack to MYHI News

Share Story8:45AM ET 2/28/2017 PRNewswire



PALM BEACH, Florida, February 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
As international demand continues to increase, the legal marijuana/cannabis industry companies are developing innovative and unique products for CBD oils and other cannabis applications, including advanced vape solutions to capitalize and push revenues higher. Performance in the markets lately have tested by recent suggestions of tougher restrictions for recreational uses forcing some companies to focus on operations on a more global scale. Recent developments in the industry of note include: Acology Inc. (OTC: ACOL), CannaSys, Inc. (OTC: MJTK), Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (OTC: MYHI) and Hemp Inc. (OTC: HEMP).
Acology Inc. (OTC: ACOL) also closed up over 29% on Monday trading over 40 Million shares by the market close. Acology announced yesterday that it is in the process of finalizing the purchase of a 13,000-sq.ft. building in Southern California. Several planned production expansions, including the creation of a new Hydroponic Products Division, a Consumer Services Division, expanded studio, artwork and printing operations and new Vendor Connect Program are all in the works.
One of Acology flagship products is the Medtainer that is versatile in its design, being able to traverse numerous consumer needs on-the-go. Through the product's ability to embody both air-tite & grinding capabilities, we are able to transcend various markets and expand its everyday uses. Although originally engineered as a solution to break down medication for the needs of Pediatric and Geriatric patients.
And in other grinding equipment news and the direction of focusing on global operations: NewGen Concepts, Inc., formerly Vapor Group, Inc. (trading on the OTC markets under the symbol - VPOR), announced that Total Vapor Inc., its subsidiary and the worldwide distributor of Easy Grinder™, is negotiating a large order with a major distributor in the Netherlands with over 400 brick-and-mortar resellers.
Since the initial 20,000 unit March production run of Easy Grinder™ is sold out, equating to over $1,000,000 in gross revenues, the new order for Europe will be fulfilled from the second run scheduled for June. The second run, planned for over 20,000 units will probably also be sold out, meaning its gross revenues will exceed $1,000,000, positively impacting results of the July-September quarter. The Company believes that Easy Grinder™ is a significant driver of its 2017 revenues and profits and that its international demand will continue to escalate as it enters diverse geographical markets beyond Europe.Read this and more news for VPOR at: http://marketnewsupdates.com/news/vpor.html
In other cannabis market performance and or developments: 
Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (OTCQB: MYHI) closed up over 29% on Monday trading over 1.2 Million shares by the market close. Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. focuses on the commercial hemp and CBD products industries.
CannaSys, Inc. (OTC: MJTK) closed up slightly on Monday trading over 26 Million shares by the market close. CannaSys provides technology services for the cannabis industry. The company offers BumpUp Rewards, a membership rewards loyalty program designed for social media ties and electronic solutions.
Hemp Inc. (OTC: HEMP) closed up on Monday trading over 23 Million shares by the market close. "With the succession of states legalizing or on track for legalizing industrial hemp, the industrial hemp industry in America is rapidly reaching a tipping point," says Bruce Perlowin, CEO of Hemp, Inc. (OTC PINK: HEMP). For the past five days, Hemp, Inc. has reported on a series of states that are on track to legalizing industrial hemp -- Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Illinois joins that list today with hopes of providing additional crop opportunities for their farmers, a market for a new crop that would have an opportunity to grow.
