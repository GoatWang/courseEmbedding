PROFILECarol R. Kaufmanview postsMs. Kaufman’s passion and in-depth knowledge about the subject of being proactively organized did not come easily. One night in the spring of 1994, a phone call derailed her. “Ms. Kaufman, I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but your parents have been involved in a tragic accident,” said the Teaneck, New Jersey, police officer. “Your mother’s been killed; your father’s in a coma, being airlifted to Hartford Hospital.” 
Despite undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Michigan and her background of working to help businesses organize and streamline, Carol, a single mom with a successful software firm, was forced to enter the swamp of her own parents’ information overload. Carol devoted the next 14 years of her life to taking care of her father. In 2008, when he passed away, she spent six months scrambling to compile all of the legal and financial documents, deeds (multiple residences), insurance policies, bank accounts, and a host of other critical information needed for the estate. Not finding a product that could pull everything together, she created one called CBData®
Carol’s solutions: Educate, Motivate and give a Call to Action, helping individuals and families understand the importance of creating Life Inventories, understanding generational differences, how to have those “difficult” conversations and getting people ready to properly organize themselves so no one ever has to go through what she did. She’s been written up in The New York Times and the Bergen Record, interviewed on FOX Chicago Morning Show, conducts Webinars, and has written numerous papers, including articles in Forbes and other publications, all to heighten the awareness of the need to be proactive and organized.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
