FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Selecting the right mortgage can be an overwhelming experience, with so many lenders competing for a borrower's business. The decision becomes even more complicated when you consider the plethora of mortgage products available. Purchasing a mortgage is often a life-changing experience, so a prudent first step in the process is to thoroughly review a selection of providers and their products. The following is a review of Stonegate Mortgage Corp. (NYSE: SGM), a niche financial company that operates as an intermediary. Its principal activities are originating mortgages, selling mortgages to investors and servicing loans to customers in the United States.
Who They Are
Stonegate Mortgage was founded in 2005, intending to become a leading provider in the emerging housing finance market. The Indianapolis company attempts to differentiate itself from competitors by providing outstanding customer service, operational efficiency and state-of-the art technology. It specializes in agency and non-agency residential mortgages through its distribution channel of retail outlets and third-party originators. The company had a market capitalization of $144.47 million, as of May 4, 2016.
Mortgage Products Offered
Stonegate Mortgage primary loan products include conventional loans, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, Veteran Affairs (VA) loans, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans and non-agency high-balance loans.
The company offers conventional mortgages with 30-, 25-, 20- or 15-year term fixed interest rates. It provides adjustable-rate mortgages in terms of three, five and seven years. Origination of the loan requires a down payment of 20%. These products are suitable for customers who prefer consistent loan payments.
FHA loans are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Authority and the federal government. Stonegate Mortgage offers 30-, 25-, 20- and 15-year terms that are available with fixed rates. Three- and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages are also available. Benefits of FHA loans include low down payments and closing costs, as well as less stringent qualification requirements.
VA loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This product is open to veterans, military personnel or a surviving spouse. Stonegate Mortgage offers 30-, 20- and 15-year fixed-rate loans, and three- and five-year adjustable-rate loans. Advantages of these loans include no down payments and competitive rates.
A USDA loan is available from the United States Department of Agriculture for those wishing to purchase rural properties. Features of the loan include no down payment and flexible credit requirements.
Non-agency high-balance loans are ideal for customers wanting to borrow between $250,000 and $5,000,000. Stonegate Mortgage offers 30- and 15-year fixed-rate loans, and 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 adjustable-rate loans. The loans offer flexibility in rates and terms.
Additionally, the company offers customers a variety of refinancing options.
Mortgage Rates
As of May 4, 2016, Stonegate Mortgage offered a 30-year conventional loan at an interest rate of 3.75% and an annual percentage rate (APR) of 3.187%. The 15-year conventional loan carries an interest rate of 2.99% with an APR of 3.104%, while a 30-year FHA loan comes with an interest rate of 3.375% and an APR of 4.217%. Thirty-year VA loans are available at an interest rate of 3.375% with an APR of 3.616%. The 30-year USDA loan offers an interest rate of 3.375% with an APR of 4.051%. Non-agency high-balance loans carry a comparably higher interest rate of 4.25% with an APR of 4.287%. Each loan product has an associated lending cost of $1,095.
What Consumers Are Saying
The Better Business Bureau gives Stonegate Mortgage a 3.7 out of a possible five-star rating. The rating is independent of customer reviews. The ten customer reviews on the organization's website, as of May 2016, reported a negative experience. The reviews have a common theme of inadequate customer service and difficulties in payment processing.
Stonegate Mortgage receives a 3.6 out of a possible five-star rating from customer reviews on LendingTree Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE), an online platform that connects consumers and lenders. The 17 reviews show a mixed response. Negative reviews focus on select offices that are disorganized when responding to customer requests. Positive reviews of the company refer to knowledgeable and helpful representatives.
