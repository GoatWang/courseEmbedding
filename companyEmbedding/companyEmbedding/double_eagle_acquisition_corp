As of today, the stock price of Double Eagle Acquisition Corp is $10.05. Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's graham number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 was $0.27. Therefore, Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is 37.45.

Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Definition
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2015 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI))


=sqrt of (22.5*0.08*0)


=N/A



Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI) (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5*0.08*0.04)


=0.27



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Mar. 2017 )


=10.05/0.27


=37.45



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Double Eagle Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq:   EAGLU), the third public acquisition vehicle led by media executive Jeff Sagansky, today announced the pricing of a $500 million initial public offering of 50,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, including $20 million, or 2,000,000 units, to be sold pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option.  Each unit issued in the initial public offering consists of one Class A ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one half of one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per full share). The units are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trade under the ticker symbol "EAGLU." Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols "EAGL" and "EAGLW," respectively.

McNamara, Dennis A. Miller and Fredric D. Rosen, have severally committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 19,500,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share at $5.75 per one-half share, at a price of $0.50 per warrant, or $9,750,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering.
Deutsche Bank Securities and BofA Merrill Lynch acted as joint book runners for the offering, with Sterne Agee CRT and I-Bankers serving as co-managers.  The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus.  When available, copies of the prospectus may be obtained from Deutsche Bank Securities, Attn: Prospectus Group, 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005, telephone: 800-503-4611, or by emailing prospectus.CPDG@db.com; or from BofA Merrill Lynch, Attn: Prospectus Department, 222 Broadway, New York, NY 10038, by telephone at 212-647-2380 or by emailing dg.prospectus_requests@baml.com.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this   
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out 
    of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts   
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.                     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of           
    approximately 3.833% (or 4.05% if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full) of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and         
    concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, up to 
    $18,400,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up
    to $22,360,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
    full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust     
    account. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay 
    all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
    which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness 
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the 
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will 
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting 
    discounts and commissions.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the $489.75 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately
$561.75 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$480 million ($10.00 per unit), or approximately $552 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will
be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and $9.75 million will be used to pay expenses in
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following
this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $48,000
per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. We expect that the
interest earned on funds placed in the trust account will be sufficient to pay
our income taxes. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
income taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or
(iii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject
to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are
utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Each warrant would be exercisable for one-half of one Class A ordinary share.
Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares. No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon
exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole
number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.
As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell
any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional
interest that will not be issued.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers,
advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in
privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of
our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated 
herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such 
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase 
shares or public warrants in such transaction. If they engage in such 
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession 
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider
trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing our
securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of
any material non-public information and (ii) clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders
will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent
upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such
purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such
purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not
necessary.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a
closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business
combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.
The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the
number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters
submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the
completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our
Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial
holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to
maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that
such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed 
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with 
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination 
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust 
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial 
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands
exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to


 throughout this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business
combination target.

We will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and
operating expertise of our management team to select, acquire and operate media
or entertainment businesses, including providers of content, with high growth 
potential in the United States or internationally, although we may pursue 
acquisition opportunities in other sectors. Our amended and restated memorandum 
and articles of association prohibits us from effectuating a business 
combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal 
operations.
