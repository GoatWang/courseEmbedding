NEW YORK, May 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- VIEX Capital Advisors, LLC, together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, "VIEX" or "we"), collectively the largest stockholder of Support.com, Inc. ("Support.com" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:  SPRT), with ownership of approximately 14.9% of the Company's outstanding shares, announced today that it has issued a letter to Support.com stockholders in connection with its campaign to elect five highly-qualified directors at the Company's upcoming annual meeting of stockholders on June 24, 2016.










 







							 		Long term destruction of shareholder value under Chairman Stephens
							  



 

 
 



The full text of the letter follows:
May 17, 2016
Dear Fellow Support.com Stockholder:
THE PERSISTENT DESTRUCTION OF STOCKHOLDER VALUE AT SUPPORT.COM WARRANTS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE BOARD
VOTE THE GOLD PROXY CARD TODAY TO RECONSTITUTE SUPPORT.COM'S BOARD WITH DIRECTORS COMMITTED TO REPRESENTING YOUR BEST INTERESTS
VIEX Capital Advisors, LLC, together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, "VIEX" or "we"), collectively the largest stockholder of Support.com, Inc. ("Support.com" or the "Company"), with ownership of approximately 14.9% of the Company's outstanding shares, is dedicated to maximizing value for Support.com's stockholders, the true owners of the Company. As the Company's largest stockholder, our interests are directly aligned with those of all Support.com stockholders - to maximize the value of the Company's stock.  Since we initiated our campaign to create value for stockholders, we have stated, both publicly and privately to Support.com's senior management and Board of Directors (the "Board"), our concerns with the Company's poor stock price performance, negative enterprise value and seemingly flawed business strategy.
Despite our efforts to engage constructively with management and the Board to tackle these fundamental problems, the Board and management team have been largely unresponsive and appear more focused on self-preservation than increasing their accountability to stockholders.  In an effort to end the erosion of stockholder value, we are therefore seeking your support to reconstitute the Board and elect our five highly-qualified, independent nominees at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for June 24, 2016. 
Given the significant destruction of stockholder value that has persisted over the near and long term under the leadership of the incumbent Board (which now includes three recent additions who were unilaterally appointed without stockholder input), it is evident to us that the Board must be immediately reconstituted to ensure that the interests of Support.com's stockholders are appropriately represented in the boardroom and that the Board takes the necessary steps to help the Company's stockholders realize the true value of their investment. 
WHY CHANGE IS NEEDED:
1. Abysmal total shareholder returns over any relevant measurable period and accumulation of substantial operating losses: 

Support.com's total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one, three, five and ten-year periods. 
Support.com's stock price declined over 52% and the Company generated approximately $28.5 million in operating losses in 2015; yet, its CEO and CFO still received substantial cash bonuses. 
Over the past ten years, Support.com has accumulated over $166 million of operating losses.
2. Board's commitment to a strategy that has been rejected by the market:

Support.com's stock is down approximately 67.6% since the announcement of beta testing of its next generation cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering Nexus. 
Support.com generated over $10 million in operating income in the fiscal year prior to the announcement of the next generation of Nexus – the Company has generated cumulative operating losses of more than $31.5 million in the two fiscal years since. 
Support.com management projects that the losses will continue in 2016 and 2017.
3. Board's defensive & reactionary approach to governance and lack of alignment with stockholders:

The Board has unilaterally taken the following actions that limit stockholders' rights since VIEX sought to maximize stockholder value:
- Adopted a poison pill effectively preventing stockholders from acquiring 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.

- Adopted Bylaw amendments making it more difficult and costly for stockholders to nominate directors and bring business before meetings.

- Replaced three incumbent directors without stockholder input.











    		              						            			  	 	
The Board collectively owns outright less than 0.4% of the Company's outstanding shares – a minimal vested financial interest in the Company's stock price performance.
4. Our nominees can restore investor confidence and unlock value for Support.com stockholders:

Our nominees are committed to fully and fairly exploring all strategic alternatives available to the Company. 
Our nominees' interests are aligned with those of all Support.com stockholders and will bring a much needed stockholder's perspective to the Board.
The Board's failure to engage meaningfully with us in our quest to restore value for Support.com stockholders has left us no choice but to run a proxy contest seeking control of the Board to ensure that the Company is being operated in a manner consistent with stockholders' best interests.
Incessant Destruction of Stockholder Value at Support.com
The Company's total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one, three, five and ten-year periods. Over each such period, Support.com has significantly trailed the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Computer Index.

In 2015 alone, Support.com's stock price declined over 52% and the Company generated approximately $28.5 million in operating losses.1 At the same time, President and Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Cholawsky and Chief Financial Officer Roop Lakkaraju received cash bonuses of $194,400 and $139,384, respectively, representing approximately 52.5% and 42.3% of their respective annual base salaries.2 How can the Compensation Committee, chaired by Chairman of the Board Jim Stephens, justify the payment of such cash bonuses given the Company's abysmal performance over the same period?
In addition, over the past ten years, Support.com has accumulated over $166 million of operating losses.3 Troublingly, Support.com generated operating income in only one fiscal year (2013) during the past decade. It is evident to us that the significant destruction of stockholder value that has persisted over the near and long term under the leadership of the incumbent Board (which now includes three recent additions who were unilaterally appointed without stockholder input) warrants a complete overhaul in the boardroom. Stockholders cannot afford to standby idly as the value of their investment further deteriorates under the current leadership team.
The Board is Committed to a Strategy that has been Rejected by the Market
Since the Company's Q1 2014 earnings call, during which Chairman Stephens (who was also Interim CEO at the time) announced the beta testing of the Company's next generation cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering Nexus, the Company's stock price has declined approximately 67.6%4, indicating that the market has rejected the Nexus strategy. Prior to the Company's Q1 2016 earnings call, management had projected that the Company would not achieve a breakeven run-rate until the end of 20185 under its existing strategy, which we did not find particularly encouraging, especially considering Nexus had already fallen behind projections. For example, in the Company's Q3 2015 earnings release, the Company disclosed "Nexus is on a path to meet the Company's 2015 year-end goals of 1,300 to 1,700 seats and $1 million in annual recurring revenue."6 The actual results for 2015 were 727 seats and $488,000 in annual recurring revenue.7 Given the Company's failure to hit projections in the past, we question whether the Company's revised guidance of expected profitability on a non-GAAP basis for the full year 20188 represents a sincere belief of management or a hollow promise in the midst of a proxy contest.
At the same time, Support.com's cash balances are being depleted in furtherance of the strategy, declining from approximately $75.5 million at the end of Q1 20149 to a newly estimated $52 million to 54 million at year end 2016.10 Even based on the Company's revised guidance, stockholders can expect the cash-burn to continue at least until 2018. Will there be anything left? Stockholders deserve representatives who will take action now to seek to restore the value of the Company.
Chairman Stephens, who has served on the Board for nearly a decade's worth of value destruction, is also the Chairman of the Strategy Committee and appears to be the architect of the Company's failing Nexus strategy. We do not believe that a director who has experienced negative total shareholder returns over every relevant measurable period during his tenure should remain on the Board, let alone be the one shaping the Company's strategic direction. Since Mr. Stephens first became Chairman of the Board on July 27, 2010, Support.com's stock price has declined 83.4%.11  As demonstrated in the chart below, over the same time period, Support.com's total shareholder returns have significantly trailed the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Computer Index.

The Board has taken Defensive Measures to Entrench Itself and Lacks Alignment with Stockholders
During the first week of October, VIEX filed its initial Schedule 13D and publicly stated an intention to engage in discussions with the Board regarding means to maximize stockholder value. Less than ten days later, the Board unilaterally adopted a poison pill generally preventing stockholders from acquiring 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock (which has since been terminated and replaced with a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan effectively preventing stockholders from acquiring 4.99% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without Board approval). The Board also subsequently unilaterally adopted numerous amendments to the Bylaws, including stringent advance notice provisions for valid director nominations and business proposals by stockholders – a thinly-veiled attempt to make it more difficult and costly for stockholders to bring business before meetings. We find the Board's actions to be self-serving and an improper use of the Company's corporate machinery to insulate itself.
In addition, we find it troubling that the Board unilaterally replaced three incumbent directors (representing half of the members of the Board) without stockholder input following our repeated efforts to upgrade the Board and maximize value for stockholders. It is evident to us that the current Board has not been interested in proactively and continually adding new talent to the Board absent stockholder intervention, and we question the ability of the incumbent Board to properly identify and select candidates who will contribute to the maximization of stockholder value given the significant value destruction that has occurred under the incumbent Board's watch. We do note the irony of Chairman Stephens, who we believe is most responsible for the persistent value destruction at Support.com, being one of the three directors who were not replaced on the Board. We are giving stockholders the opportunity to do so now.
Further, we believe the Board's ineffectiveness at tackling the persistent destruction of stockholder value is in large part a function of a troubling misalignment of interests between the directors and Support.com's stockholders. Collectively, even including the recent purchase made by CEO Elizabeth Cholawsky on May 2, 2016, the members of the Board own outright less than 0.4% of the Company's outstanding shares. Even when including all unexercised options and awards that vest within 60 days, the members of the Board collectively beneficially own just approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares.12 We believe that the low level of stock ownership by the incumbent Board evidences a lack of alignment between their interests and the interests of the Company's current stockholders since the Board has little "skin in the game." VIEX, on the other hand, owns approximately 14.9% of the Company's outstanding stock.  It seems apparent to us that with so little at personal stake, the Board does not have the same commitment to stockholder value as we do.
Our Nominees are Committed to Restoring Value for Support.com's Stockholders

Vertex Urges YuMe To Review Strategic Alternatives
Oct 7 15
Vertex Capital Advisors, LLC believes YuMe, Inc. (NYSE:YUME) must focus on strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and be accountable to shareholders on capital allocation. Vertex estimates the YuMe core business will generate approximately $140 million of revenue in 2015. Vertex thinks now is the time for YuMe to undertake a self tender given the strength of its core business.


Vertex Urges Numerex To Look For Strategic Options
Aug 5 15
Vertex Capital Advisors, LLC has urged Numerex Corp. (NasdaqGS:NMRX) to pursue strategic options. Stratton Nicolaides, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Numerex, said, "The Company's performance has rebounded from the first quarter and is expected to post sequential improvement in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in each of the third and fourth quarters. As part of our strategic and financial planning process, developed by the Board of Directors and executive management, we have considered a full range of strategic and financial alternatives to boost operating performance and increase shareholder value. As a result, we have taken steps over the past several months to enhance gross margins and reduce operating expenses, which have reduced our operating expenses from the first quarter and curtailed our overall costs by an annualized run-rate of $4 million; $2 million of which we expect will benefit the second half of this year. This is partially attributable to the completion of several projects and the elimination of related expenses," Vertex said: "The Reporting Persons call upon the Board to undertake a serious, objective and thorough strategic review process, by retaining a financial advisor and forming an independent strategic review committee, ahead of the appointment of a new CEO."

SAN DIEGO, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:    MXWL) ("Maxwell" or the "Company"), a leading developer and manufacturer of capacitor energy storage and power delivery solutions, announced today that it entered into a cooperation agreement with Viex Capital Advisors, LLC and its affiliates ("Viex") under which the Maxwell Board has agreed to appoint Mr. John Mutch as an independent director and to nominate Mr. Mutch for election at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as a Class III director of the Company for a term expiring in 2020. Mr. Mutch was selected by Viex but is not an affiliate or associate of Viex. Additionally, the Company and Viex have agreed that, following the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Board will reduce its size to eight, including the Viex nominee. 








"We are pleased to strengthen our Board with the addition of a new, highly qualified, independent director nominee, who will add valuable experience and fresh perspective to the Maxwell Board," said Dave Schlotterbeck, Maxwell's Chairman of the Board. "The entire Maxwell team is unified in its focus on maximizing stockholder value and looks forward to working collaboratively with our directors to generate enhanced returns for the Company's stockholders."
"We believe Maxwell is an excellent company, with solid fundamentals and a strong market position in the energy storage space," said Eric Singer, Founder and Managing Member of Viex. "We appreciate the constructive working relationship we have built with Franz and the team at Maxwell over the last year and are pleased to have reached this agreement. We believe that strengthening the Board with highly experienced and independent directors will support the Company in executing on its plans to drive sales growth and profitability for the benefit of all shareholders. We are excited to work collaboratively to realize the Company's full potential for value creation."
As part of the agreement, Viex has agreed to abide by certain customary standstill and voting provisions and has agreed to vote in favor of the Company's slate of director nominees at the 2017 Annual Meeting and certain other matters.
The complete agreement between Maxwell and Viex will be included as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Quantum Corporation and VIEX Capital Advisors Sign Agreement to Reconstitute Quantum Board to Consist of a Majority of New Directors PR Newswire – March 3, 2017   SAN JOSE, Calif., March 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Quantum Corp.

										VIEX Capital 
										


Funded by Stride in May 2014














VIEX engages in an activist strategy, creating catalysts to unlock shareholder value in small cap companies, predominantly in technology.
Most successful activists have moved up-market to focus on larger caps.  Increased competition has diminished returns and directed time and energy on more well-equipped companies to resist change.  Passive capital flows from ETFs, quants and high frequency traders have made created a greater disparity in company mispricings
VIEX focuses on the small cap landscape where there is also less competition and a greater willingness to accept strategic alternatives.  Extensive domain experience informs a focus on technology companies with undervalued or under-performing assets and strong balance sheets amid a landscape of capital mismanagement and frequent industry consolidation. Self-directed outcomes can overcome the growing influence of passive capital flows.
Founder and Portfolio manager Eric Singer brings decades of intensive investment research and successful M&A transaction experience.  He has directly held nine board seats in his career in addition to making numerous successful Board placements and building a record of winning proxy battles.

"The entire Maxwell team is unified in its focus on maximizing stockholder value and looks forward to working collaboratively with our directors to generate enhanced returns for the Company's stockholders."
"We believe Maxwell is an excellent company, with solid fundamentals and a strong market position in the energy storage space," said Eric Singer, Founder and Managing Member of Viex. "We appreciate the constructive working relationship we have built with Franz and the team at Maxwell over the last year and are pleased to have reached this agreement. We believe that strengthening the Board with highly experienced and independent directors will support the Company in executing on its plans to drive sales growth and profitability for the benefit of all shareholders. We are excited to work collaboratively to realize the Company's full potential for value creation."

Support.com Confirms Receipt of Director Nominations from Viex CapitalRedwood City, Calif. – March 28, 2016 – Support.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPRT) (“Support.com” or the “Company”) today confirmed that it has received a notice of nomination from Viex Capital Advisors, LLC (“Viex”) regarding its intention to nominate five director candidates in an attempt to replace a majority of Support.com’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Support.com stockholders are not required to take any action at this time. The Company issued the following statement:
“Support.com strives to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of its stockholders and welcomes and values their input. We have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue with Viex and other stockholders to discuss their views on our Board composition, governance, business strategy and performance. In light of our extensive efforts to constructively engage with Viex and the other members of its investor group since last October, we are disappointed they have abandoned our private conversation and are now publicly threatening a costly and distracting proxy contest to replace five out of the six members of our Board. We believe this is a counterproductive tactic that risks destabilizing the execution of our ongoing initiatives for creating value for all Support.com stockholders.
“Our Board is comprised of six highly qualified and very experienced directors, five of whom are independent and all of whom are actively engaged in overseeing the execution of Support.com’s strategic plan to drive increased stockholder value creation. Reflective of our continuing commitment to ensure our Board has the right perspectives, insights, experiences and competencies, the Nominating and Governance Committee recently undertook a thorough search process to find additional independent directors who would expand the depth and breadth of the Board. As a result of that process, earlier this year, we added Elizabeth Fetter, Lowell Robinson and Tim Stanley, each of whom replaced a director who resigned from the Board. Ms. Fetter, and Messrs. Robinson and Stanley have extensive senior management, technology and governance experience and their fresh perspectives and insights will be extremely valuable to the Company.”
The Support.com Board will present its formal recommendation regarding director nominations in the Company’s definitive proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has not yet scheduled its 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Stockholders interested in learning more about the Company’s strategy for driving stockholder value, or speaking with a member of the management team, should contact Jacob Moelter in Investor Relations at (650) 556-8595.
