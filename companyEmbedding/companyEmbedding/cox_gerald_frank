Grave Registration Reports (GRRs) are standard forms which detail graves for which the Commission is responsible within a particular burial ground. They provide basic details of the individuals, such as name, service number, rank, regiment, unit and date of death, and are listed in Plot, Row and Grave order.

Grave Registration Documents - Registers




Registers were produced by the Commission on a cemetery-by-cemetery or memorial-by-memorial basis, and eventually ran to 1,500 volumes. They contain an entry for each individual, with details of their rank, regiment, unit and date of death. Many of the entries also include additional information such as next of kin details.
Download








                                These record details of individuals who were originally buried in smaller or isolated cemeteries, but who, at a later date, were exhumed and reburied in war cemeteries. The concentration of cemeteries allowed otherwise unmaintainable graves to be moved into established war grave cemeteries where the Commission could ensure proper commemoration.

involved in the commemoration of individuals. As a result, they
contain many corrections and alterations which reflect their use as
working documents. For further information concerning the history
of the collection, please see our About Our Records page.
Please be advised that some of the documents, especially the
burial returns and exhumation reports, may contain information
which some people may find distressing. The original archive
records and their digital copies remain the property of the
Commonwealth War Graves Commission, but are available for re-use

            of the red circle around an author's name is proportional to the number of publications
            that he or she has. The thickness of a line connecting two authors' names is proportional
            to the number of publications that they share. Options for customizing this network
