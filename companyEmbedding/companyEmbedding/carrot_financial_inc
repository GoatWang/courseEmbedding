Your customers qualify.

            Many of today's borrowers can't qualify for traditional credit, 
            even though they have the ability to pay. We look at things a 
            little differently, helping almost everyone with at least a part 
            of their bill.
          




No FICO fiasco.

            Most often supplied by banks, borrowed funds may only be had with a 
            relatively stellar FICO score leaving many Americans without options 
            to purchase needed or desired services.
