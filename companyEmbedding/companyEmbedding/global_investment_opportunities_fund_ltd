Source: FactSetGoogle, Inc.abc.xyzAlphabet, Inc. is a newly founded holding company for the Google group of businesses. Under the new operating structure, its main Google business will include search, ads, maps, apps, YouTube and Android and the related technical infrastructure (the 'Google business'). Businesses such as Calico, Nest, and Fiber, as well as its investing arms, such as Google Ventures and Google Capital, and incubator projects, such as Google X, will be managed separately from the Google business. The new legal and operating structure will be introduced in phases over the coming months and when finalized, Google anticipates that it will result in two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes, with the Google business presented separately from other Alphabet businesses taken as a whole. Accordingly, Alphabet will report its results under this new structure commencing with its Q4 earnings release and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2015. The company was founded on 2nd October, 2015 and is headquartered in Mountain View, CA.
Source FactSetAltice N.V.altice.netThe Altice Group is a multinational cable, fiber, telecommunications, contents and media company. Services provided include pay television, broadband internet, fixed line telephony and mobile phones for both residential and corporate customers. It operates in Western Europe, the United States, Israel and the Overseas Territories (currently comprising the French Caribbean and the Indian Ocean regions and the Dominican Republic). The company was founded by Patrick Drahi on May 18, 2015 and is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Baidu, Inc.www.baidu.comBaidu is the leading internet search engine in China. As with Google, advertisers bid on Baidu-generated "key words." Baidu is paid a fee when one uses its search function, clicks on a key word, and moves to the advertiser's website. The company has nearly 80% market share of Chinese search, making it more dominant than Google is in the United States.

As online penetration increases, advertisers should begin to switch their advertising spending from more traditional media (ie TV, newspaper) to online mediums (ie internet search, video).  The average Chinese person spends roughly 3x of his or her personal time using the internet versus watching TV. Despite this dynamic, 60% of China's advertising budgets are spent on TV, 6x those that target the internet. As the proportion of advertising spend adjusts to time spent on various media activities, online advertising spending should begin to take share.

As social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter become more prevalent, concerns arise over whether these platforms can become a popular method for advertising, diverting business from Baidu. However, the effectiveness and return on investment of the search medium is well-documented, while the newer social advertising business models are still young and unproven.Ryanair Holdingswww.ryanair.comRyanair Holdings Plc operates an ultra-low cost, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Morocco. It provides low fares airline-related services, including scheduled services, and ancillary services—including car services, and Internet and other related services to third parties, across a European route network. The company was founded on June 5, 1996 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.

Barratt has little debt and attractive valuations relative to its growth potential. Barratt is benefiting from the U.K. housing market's recovery, which is still in its early stages as demand is outstripping supply. Government support for housing should also boost volumes and prices.Citigroup, Inc.www.citigroup.comCitigroup is a diversified financial services holding company that provides a broad range of financial services to consumer and corporate customers around the world.  The Company's services include investment banking, retail brokerage, corporate banking, and cash management products and services.

Banking the global emerging consumer is an attractive business with good returns and also provides Citigroup with the necessary deposits to fund its Corporate bank.  Lastly, the realignment of the U.S. business and redeployment of that capital into higher return businesses with the potential for faster growth could lead to a business with a better than industry returns over time.Wynn Resorts Ltd.www.wynnresorts.comWynn Resorts Ltd. engages in the development and management of casino resorts.

Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.  Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.  Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.  This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds.  Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) may bear additional risk. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. A short position will lose value as the security's price increases. Theoretically, the loss on a short sale can be unlimited. Investments in the Funds are not FDIC insured, nor are they bank deposits or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity.  
The performance data quoted represents past performance; it does not guarantee future results.
Income earned from municipal bonds is exempt from regular federal and in some cases, state and local income tax. Income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Class I shares may not be available to all investors. Minimum investments for the I share class may be higher than those for other classes.
To determine a fund's Morningstar Rating™, funds and other managed products with at least a three-year history are ranked in their categories by their Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return scores. The top 10% receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the middle 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Risk-Adjusted Return accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance (excluding sales charges), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Other share classes may have different performance characteristics. © 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

P/B Ratio
The price to book (P/B) value ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.

Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.

International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.

The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

Performance may be attributable to unusually high IPO profits. There is no guarantee this level of performance will be repeated. IPO securities have no trading history and the price may be volatile.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.
