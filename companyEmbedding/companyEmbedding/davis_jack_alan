Alan Jack "A.J." Davis, 65, died suddenly Tuesday evening (May 31, 2016) at his residence in Manor.

Alan was a sound technician and engineer with Rascal's Lounge and Restaurant in Lake Park and had worked with many area bands for all of his adult life.

I hate that I was out of town and that it was actually several days after his passing that I heard the sad news. Had the privilege of working with Mr Alan for several years. Not just with Alibi. But at many different times. I wouldve liked to have been able to pay my respects to a fine man.. He was great at what he did. I agree with Bob Tanner. If Alan told you he had it.  No matter what the issue was. You could rest assure that it would be handled. It makes me smile even at this sad time. To think about what a Great Sound Tech that they'll have at the next show up in Heaven. I'm sure Jones, Haggard, Whitley , Royals and all of the other greats will appreciate you as much as so many us have in the past.. RIP My Friend....

Alan had a lot of friends that went way back as we used to say. I was proud to be one of those. Alan was in the first band I was in and we stayed in touch in successive years and different bands we played in until he went to sound full time. We had a lot of good times together.

He had the knack of making you feel like you were family. I will miss Alan a lot.

I can't believe he is gone.  He was so kind to me when I was a 19 year old, know nothing guitarist by letting me sit in with the band he was in if I would help move equipment.  I will never forget that.  He was always one of the most level headed, good hearted people I've ever know.  I will miss him. Rip Snow

Info on the finalists:
Natasha Baker: state school reform officer for the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget. Previously, Baker was the deputy superintendent and state school reform officer in the division of education services for the Michigan Department of Education.  Alan Coverstone: assistant professor of education and director of graduate programs in education at Belmont University. Previously, Coverstone was the executive officer of charter schools for Metro Nashville Public Schools, and also served as the executive officer for innovation in the district.  Clifford Davis, Jr.: chief of staff for Knox County Schools. Davis has been in Knox County Schools since 2005, previously working as the executive director of secondary education.  Jack Elsey, Jr.: chief schools officer for the Education Achievement Authority of Michigan. Prior to this, Elsey was the chief officer of innovation and incubation for Chicago Public Schools. From 2005-2011 he was the managing director of public affairs and school relations for Teach for America, New York.  Timothy Gadson III: superintendent designee and executive director of curriculum and schools for Robbinsdale Area Schools in Minnesota. From 2014 to 2016, Gadson worked as the associate superintendent for Atlanta Public Schools.  Stuart Greenberg: chief academic officer for Leon County Public Schools in Flordia. Prior to that, Greenberg was the executive director for Reading and Early Learning for the Florida Department of Education. Greenberg was one of the six finalists in Knox County's recent superintendent search.  Arthur Wayne Johnson: founder and chairman of First Performance Corporation. Prior to that, Johnson was the CEO of Reunion Financial Services Corporation and a managing partner at Global Education Partners. He lives in Georgia.  Bryan Johnson: chief academic officer for Clarksville-Montgomery County School System in Tennessee. Before being named to that position, he served as the director of high schools for the district.  Kirk Kelly: interim superintendent of Hamilton County Schools. Kelly has been an educator in Chattanooga City and Hamilton County Schools for 35 years, starting as a math teacher and moving up to assistant superintendent for accountability and testing, before being selected to serve as interim superintendent.  Source: Information about each candidate is taken from the résumés emailed to the school board.

More than 48 hours after the list of superintendent finalists was trimmed in secret, Hamilton County Board of Education members were given the names of the nine candidates they'll interview for the post.
School board Chairman Steve Highlander told the board Thursday afternoon that Natasha Baker, Alan Coverstone, Clifford Davis, Jack Elsey Jr., Timothy Gadson III, Stuart Greenberg, Arthur Wayne Johnson, Bryan Johnson and Kirk Kelly will be interviewed. The times will be announced later.
Last week, Highlander told each board member to name 10 candidates they wanted to interview from the pool of 14. He asked for two lists, each in alphabetical order, with the first list representing their top five choices.
On Tuesday, Highlander, the board secretary and a representative from the search firm, Coleman Lew and Associates, tabulated the results in private. Highlander has not said what method was used to tabulate the results, or whether candidates on the members' top five lists were weighted differently from those on their second lists.
State law says the board must deliberate in public and members may not cast secret votes or use emails as a way to avoid open meetings laws.
"All votes of any such governmental body shall be by public vote or public ballot or public roll call. No secret votes, or secret ballots, or secret roll calls shall be allowed," according to state law.
The Times Free Press requested the board members' emailed lists of candidates Tuesday. The emails are public records in Tennessee.
Highlander released the emails to the Times Free Press on Thursday, after the search firm contacted each candidate.
According to the emails, school board members Joe Galloway, Karitsa Mosley Jones, Kathy Lennon, David Testerman and Highlander all included Kelly, the district's interim superintendent, on their lists of top-five candidates.
Lennon, Galloway and Testerman advocated for hiring Kelly as permanent superintendent in November before the board decided to hold a search. Board members Tiffanie Robinson and Joe Wingate were the only ones not to name Kelly among their total 10 candidates.
One other candidate, Arthur Johnson, also appeared on five board members' lists of top-five candidates.
Scott Bennett, the school board attorney, earlier this week defended the process for narrowing the finalist list. He argued the board did not violate the state's open meetings law because board members did not meet together and discuss their opinions or work toward a consensus. He said board members just shared their interview choices with Highlander via email, and he then determined the number of candidates to interview and who to interview based on those preferences.
"The board certainly could have done this whole thing in an open meeting, and the only reason they did it by email is for expediency," Bennett said Tuesday.
Testerman said Thursday he thinks the superintendent search process could have been more transparent, and he said several board members are frustrated they had to wait two days to learn the finalists.
"I hope we can be better with [the process] going forward," he added.
Testerman said this search needs to be one of the board's top priorities, and he hopes the video interviews with candidates will be scheduled soon.
It's been more than a year since former Superintendent Rick Smith resigned after months of turmoil following the Ooltewah High School rape case. The school board in November hired the search firm at a cost of about $60,000.

Product Liability Lawyers


Every year, hundreds of thousands of consumers sustain serious injuries from unsafe, defective or dangerous products. Some of these products are “recalled” by manufacturers and some are not. Regardless, many of these injuries could have been avoided if manufacturers or distributors had taken additional steps to ensure consumer safety.
If you think you were injured as a result of a defective or dangerous product, contact the experienced product liability attorneys at Slack & Davis. Our firm has built a reputation for helping citizens go up against wealthy and powerful adversaries.
Raising Awareness about Product Defects
There are three types of product defects that involve manufacturers and suppliers:

 Design defect: a flaw in the design of the product that makes it dangerous
 Manufacturing defects: the product does not conform to the designer’s or manufacturer’s specifications
 Marketing defects: improper labeling of products, insufficient instructions, or failure to include a proper warning label about the product’s hidden dangers

The product liability attorneys at Slack & Davis regularly handle many different types of lawsuits related to product defects and failures, including:

Automobiles (including cars, trucks, SUVs, buses and tractor trailers)
Vehicle safety equipment, including seatbelts and child car seats
Tires, including tire failure
Aviation and airplane equipment
Medical products, including surgical equipment and medical devices
Pharmaceuticals, both over-the-counter and prescription drugs
Takata Airbags

Regardless of whether a defective product has been officially recalled, you may still have a product liability case. The validity of your case is not contingent upon whether a recall was issued. Product liability can be established if there was a flaw in the product’s design, if there was an error made during the manufacturing process, if the product was irresponsibly marketed with improper or insufficient directions for use, or if the manufacturer failed to adequately warn consumers of potential dangers. The product liability lawyers of Slack & Davis will handle your case with respect and sensitivity, while at the same time fighting tirelessly for your rights. Call 1-800-455-8686 for a free case evaluation. The following are summaries of recent or current cases litigated by Slack & Davis product liability attorneys. Recoveries were made on behalf of:

Multiple plaintiffs with cases related to defective pacemakers and defibrillators manufactured by Guidant Corporation. Each case was evaluated and settled individually.
Multiple plaintiffs with cases related to defective hip and knee replacement products manufactured by Sulzer Orthopedics. Each case was evaluated and settled individually.
Multiple plaintiffs with cases related to defective knee replacement products manufactured by Smith & Nephew. Each case was evaluated and settled individually.
Five members of a Dallas family, who were driving to Colorado for a baseball tournament. While traveling on a rural, two-lane road, the tread of the left rear tire separated from the tire and wrapped around the axle so tightly, the emergency brake cable engaged, locking the wheel and ultimately causing the vehicle to roll over several times and land on its roof. One child died as a result of this crash. Other family members suffered numerous traumatic injuries. Slack & Davis represented the surviving family members in their claim that the crash was caused by a defective tire that was manufactured in Taiwan and sold in Dallas by a U.S. distributor.
A Northeast Texas man was driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in his backyard when the throttle control became stuck in the open throttle position. The ATV traveled out-of-control along a barbed wire fence and hit a tree. He sustained severe injuries which resulted in his death. Slack & Davis represented the man’s family and alleged that the ATV’s throttle system was defectively designed and manufactured. This case was settled for a confidential amount after jury selection at trial.
A woman who was killed in a relatively minor collision. Defects in her car’s automatic passive shoulder belt system caused massive internal injuries.
An amputee who sustained serious injuries during a fall that was caused by a defective prosthetic device. The prosthesis, which was attached below his left knee, failed when the locking pin unexpectedly detached from the liner. When the prosthesis came off, our client fell, landing on his knee and cracking his femur. This led to surgery and painful rehabilitation.
A four-year-old boy who was rendered a paraplegic as a result of a car wreck. The child was restrained with lap and shoulder belts in the left rear seat. During the collision, because of poor fit of the shoulder/lap belt restraint system and seat, the boy’s body rotated out of the shoulder restraint and jackknifed violently over the lap and shoulder belts. Slack & Davis attorneys argued that the seat belts were not designed to safely restrain and protect children who have outgrown child safety seats.
A quadriplegic injured in an SUV rollover. This lawsuit was filed against the SUV’s retailer who sold our client the car without the federally required warning label. In addition, our client previously had obtained a recovery from the driver’s insurance carrier, and a recovery from the manufacturer sufficient to secure his lifetime needs.
A man who suffered a head injury in a collision, due to defective minivan door latches that flew open and caused him to be ejected from the vehicle.
A child who died in an accident involving a household appliance.
An individual who lost eight fingers in a pulley, while operating a machine that manufactured cement blocks. Our lawsuit contended that the manufacturer should have designed the machine with a safety guard around the pulley.
Plaintiffs who rented an RV for an overnight hunting trip. As they were driving home, the RV suddenly exploded in flames, resulting in burn injuries to the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed against the manufacturer, owner and lessor of the vehicle.
A woman who was ejected from the backseat and out the back window upon collision. She suffered permanent brain damage. The claim asserted that the car manufacturer was liable because of its failure to use laminated glass in the back window.
A man who suffered a closed head injury when his car’s seat back failed in a rear end collision, causing his head to strike against the roof of the car.
A client who experienced eye injuries due to an exploding water softener.
Parents of a baby boy whose car seat failed in a crash. Although the collision was relatively minor, the child’s skull was crushed and he received brain injuries. Slack & Davis argued that the seat was improperly designed to protect children in a side-impact collision. Although a large percentage of collisions are side-impact, most manufacturers do not test their seats’ performance in this type of crash because the government doesn’t require it.

THE COMPANY.
Ruff Reams Building Company is the product of more than a decade of quality building experience and nearly 20 years of friendship between Paul Davis and Alan Simpson.  The seeds of this partnership were planted in the 1990s at Auburn University where Paul and Alan met and formed a lasting friendship over shared values and common interests in building, planning, and design. 
Prior to partnering in 2003, Alan and Paul each had several years experience in construction management -- Alan with Fedrick Harris Estate Homes in Nashville, TN and Paul with Precision Builders in Montgomery, AL.  Their experiences during this time gave them an inspired sense of what a building company could and should be, as well as the practical tools needed to develop what is now Ruff Reams Building Company.



Ruff Reams is a family business that relies heavily on the team concept to make sure all parts work effectively.  While Paul and Alan are the job site managers of each home that is built by Ruff Reams, Lee Ann Davis and Kate Simpson provide equal contribution through their organization of office management.  As a real estate agent and graduate of Auburnâs school of interior design, Lee Ann handles account management and book keeping.   Kate also shares much of the office responsibilities through her 15 years of experience in the insurance business.  Kate maintains and secures all insurance certificates for each contractor that performs work on a Ruff Reams job.
