Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C., Docket No. 02-0966









SECRETARY OF LABOR,

 



Complainant,

 



v.

OSHRC DOCKET NO. 02-0966



MARCUS CABLE ASSOCIATES, L.L.C.,

 



Respondent.

 





APPEARANCES:

              For the Complainant:
                            Chris Grier, Esq., U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Dallas, Texas

              For the Respondent: 
                            David B. Jones, Esq., Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C., Atlanta, Georgia

Before:            Administrative Law Judge: Benjamin R. Loye

DECISION AND ORDER

            This proceeding arises under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Section
651-678; hereafter called the “Act”).
            At all times relevant to this action Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C. (Marcus) maintained a place
of business in Burleson, Texas, where it was engaged in providing and maintaining cable service.  Marcus
admits it is an employer engaged in a business affecting commerce and is subject to the requirements of
the Act.  Marcus is a subsidiary of Charter Cable Operating Company, L.L.C., which is owned by Charter
Communications Operating, L.L.C. , which is, in turn,  held by Charter Communications Holding
Company, L.L.C.  (Tr. Vol. II, p. 10; Exh. R-19).  The citation and complaint in this matter were originally
issued to Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter).   At the hearing, Marcus introduced testimony showing,
inter alia, that Charter owns less than 50 percent of the holding company that owns Marcus (Tr. Vol. II,
p. 9).  As a result, the Secretary and Marcus entered into a stipulation identifying Marcus as the employer
of the affected employees in this case, and requesting the substitution of Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C.
as the Respondent in this action.   The parties’ request to amend the caption in this matter is GRANTED,
and will be reflected in this Decision and Order and in any further pleadings.
            On April 5, 2002 Jurica Miskovic, fell to his death from the bucket of a Ford F-450 bucket truck. 
Following the fatality, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducted an
inspection of Miskovic’s working conditions.  As a result of that inspection, citations were issued to
Miskovic’s employer, now identified as Respondent Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C.  The citation alleges
violations of the Act together with proposed penalties.  By filing a timely notice of contest, Respondent
brought this proceeding before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission). 

            On November 14-15, 2002, a hearing was held in Dallas, Texas.  The parties have submitted briefs
on the issues and this matter is ready for disposition.
Facts
            Aaron Villareal, a system technician with Marcus (Tr. Vol. I, p. 22), testified that he had lunch with
Jurica Miskovic on April 5, 2002 (Tr. Vol. I, p. 24).  Because Mr. Miskovic was finished with his calls for
that day, he volunteered to help Villareal with the remainder of his repairs (Tr. Vol. I, p. 24).  Villareal
stated that Miskovic raised the bucket of his truck about 18 feet above the ground to work on an elevated
cable (Tr. Vol. I, p. 25).  Miskovic had been issued a full body harness and lanyard, but was not wearing
them (Tr. Vol. I, p. 26).  Villareal testified that Miskovic was a grown man, and made his own decisions. 
Villareal would not have presumed to tell him to wear his fall protection (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 51-52).  Villareal
turned away to stow a test line for Miskovic; when he turned around he saw Miskovic fall from the basket
to the ground (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 26-27).  Miskovic’s harness was found  in the tool bin of his truck after the
accident (Tr. Vol. I, p. 53).  
            Villareal testified that when he was promoted to system technician, he received on-the-job training
from more experienced technicians (Tr. Vol. I, p. 35).  Villareal rode along on service calls, and observed
the other technicians (Tr.Vol. I, pp. 35-36).  Kenneth Trujillo, a system technician with Marcus
Communications from October 2000 to August 2002 (Tr. Vol. I, p. 63), also testified that his training
consisted solely of on-the-job training received during ride-alongs (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 75-76).  Trujillo stated
that the training he received covered splicing cable, balancing cable amplifiers, etc.  He did not receive
training in the safe operation of a bucket truck (Tr. Vol. I, p. 76).  Villareal testified similarly, but stated
that he was able to operate the truck without difficulty without the benefit of any formal training (Tr. Vol.
I, pp. 35-36, 38).  He stated that the hazards associated with operating a bucket truck, i.e., energized
overhead lines and fall hazards were common knowledge among service technicians (Tr. Vol. I, p. 39).  
            Though the danger of falling was well recognized, Villareal testified, full-body harnesses and safety
lanyards were not provided to system techs until a fiber line was cut at the office, and Jerome Butler, a
technical supervisor, observed all the techs working without appropriate fall protection (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 40,
44).  After that incident, harnesses and bungee straps were issued to the techs (Tr. Vol. I, p. 40).  Villareal
could not recall the date harnesses were issued; however, Kenneth Trujillo testified that he received his
harness approximately three months prior to Miskovic’s accident (Tr. Vol. I, p. 67).  Trujillo stated that
up until that time he had to use his safety belt, which is used for climbing ladders and poles, while working
from his bucket (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 65-68).  Trujillo stated that he repeatedly asked his supervisor, Duane
Moment, for a harness, but was told that they were out of stock (Tr. Vol. I, p. 66).   
            Both Villareal and Trujillo testified that, after receiving harnesses, they were admonished at each
regular Wednesday safety meeting  to wear the fall protection (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 45-46, 68).  Trujillo,
however, testified that they were never shown how to use or inspect the body harness or body belt and strap
(Tr. Vol.1, pp. 67-68).   Moreover, both Villareal and Trujillo agreed that the technicians rarely wore fall
protection prior to Miskovic’s accident (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 50, 69, 71).  According to both techs, it took longer
to put on the harness than it did to complete most jobs, so the technicians did not bother to put on the
harnesses and lanyards unless they were worried about being caught without them (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 51, 70-71).  
            John Vallejo, who worked as a line technician for Marcus until May or June of 2002, used a bucket
truck to work on the main cable lines (Tr. Vol. I, p. 84-85).  Vallejo stated that a body harness and lanyard
were issued to his truck, but that he was never trained to inspect or to use them (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 88-89). 
Vallejo never used the body harness, which remained wadded up in his truck the entire time he worked for
Marcus (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 89-90).  Nor did Vallejo ever see the other technicians using body harnesses.   He
testified that there was not enough time for the techs to complete their routes if they took time out to put
on the fall protection (Tr. Vol. I, p. 92).
            Tony Shaw worked as a line maintenance technician for Marcus until January 2000 (Tr. Vol. I, p.
99).  Shaw testified that a body harness and lanyard were issued with his 2000 F-450 Ford bucket truck
(Tr. Vol. I, pp.102-03).  Though Shaw was not trained in the use of the body harness and lanyard, he
understood that he was supposed to use them every time he went up in the bucket (Tr. Vol. I, p. 104).


 
Shaw testified that he wore the fall protection 95% of the time, but that on 5% of his calls, he was in too
much of a hurry to get his work done to spend the time it took to don the equipment (Tr. Vol. I, p. 104). 
Shaw had, on occasion, seen other technicians working from aerial lifts without fall protection (Tr. Vol.
I, p. 106).
             Trujillo testified that no supervisory personnel ever saw him working without fall protection,
because none ever came out to his job site (Tr. Vol. I, p. 70, 72).  Villareal stated that Ervin Adams was
the only supervisor to perform spot checks in the field (Tr. Vol. I, p. 29, 49).  To his knowledge, Adams
never saw him working from his bucket without his harness and lanyard on (Tr. Vol. I, p. 49).  Mr. Vallejo,
however, was disciplined on February 21, 2002 after Ervin Adams saw him on a ladder without a safety
strap or a hard hat (Tr. Vol. I, p. 94-96; Exh. R-12).
            Ervin Adams, who was, during the relevant period, the system technical manager at Marcus (Tr.
Vol. I, p.194), confirmed that technicians received mainly on-the-job training (Tr. Vol. I, p.195).  More
experienced technicians would show the apprentice techs how to perform whatever function was called
for on a particular job (Tr. Vol .I, p. 195).  Adams testified that the purpose of the regular Wednesday
morning meetings was actually to discuss general concerns.  The safety portion of the meetings was
“thrown in” at the end of the meeting.  Safety concerns, such as bee stings, might be discussed (Tr. Vol.
I, p. 196).  According to Adams, Marcus’ safety policy required that all employees be tied off when
working from a  bucket (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 200, 207).  Adams did not know whether employees were actually
provided with a written copy of the policy (Tr. Vol. I, p. 208).  The policy was supposed to be
communicated to employees during on-the-job training, and in meetings (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 200, 208).  Adams
did not go to safety meetings himself, however.  According to Adams, that was the supervisors’ job (Tr.
Vol. I, p. 202).  Adams testified that he did check up on the technicians in the field, but stated that the
purpose of his visits was not to check on safety (Tr. Vol. I, p. 196).  Adams did occasionally stop to ask
a technician to put cones out behind his truck, and Adams recalled observing Manuel Vallejo working
without fall protection on February 21, 2002, which led to the disciplinary action against Mr. Vallejo (Tr.
Vol. I, pp. 197-98).  
            Duane Moment, Miskovic’s supervisor (Tr. Vol. I, p. 212), could not recall who provided Miskovic
with his on-the-job training (Tr. Vol. I, p. 213).  Apprentice techs were assigned to whichever more
experienced technician was working during that shift (Tr. Vol. I, p. 213).  According to Moment,
Miskovic’s training may or may not have included the proper use of a bucket truck, depending on what
jobs he rode along on.  If the work to be done was underground work, use of the bucket would not have
come up (Tr. Vol. I, p. 213).  Moment testified that the he only went out into the field when one of his
technicians would call for support (Tr. Vol. I, p. 215).  Because the technician knew when Moment was
coming, he would always be wearing the appropriate personal gear, including fall protection (Tr. Vol. I,
p. 215).  Moment was not familiar with Marcus’ safety handbook, or with any specific safety rule requiring
that safety belts be attached to the designated attachment point of the boom whenever an employee was
working aloft from aerial equipment (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 223-24).  Moment did attest that Manuel Vallejo’s
disciplinary action was discussed in the February 27, 2002 Wednesday morning meeting (Tr. Vol. I, p. 222;
Exh. R-4; see also, testimony of Ralph Varnado, Tr. Vol. I, pp. 255, 261).  The sign in sheet for that
meeting indicates that Jurica Miskovic was in attendance (Exh. R-4, p. 2).
            Ralph Varnado, a supervisor at Marcus (Tr. Vol. I, p. 249), testified regarding an e-mail he received
on Wednesday, March 27, 2002 (Tr. Vol. I, p. 251; Exh. R-3).  The e-mail consisted of a memo regarding
a Charter Communication employee who was observed by a MIOSHA inspector.  The employee was
working from a boom bucket without a harness or lanyard.  The employee had an “Aerial Platform Permit,”
and “[s]hould have known” better (Exh. R-3).  The memo suggested that “you get a strong message out
to you employees, safety meetings, additional safety training (if necessary) and Technical Supervisors QC
safety visits to the employees in the field (sic).”  (Exh. R-3).  According to Varnado, the e-mail was posted
in the meeting area at Marcus (Tr. Vol. I, p. 252).  Varnado testified that the e-mail was discussed at the
following April 3, 2002 Wednesday morning meeting (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 253, 260, 262).  Jurika Miskovic’s
signature appears on the sign in sheet for the April 3, 2002 meeting (Tr. Vol. I, p. 253; Exh. R-3, p. 3).
            Mr. Varnado testified that he made trips into the field twice a week specifically to ensure that the
men under his supervision were following safe work practices (Tr. Vol. I, p. 257).  His men were generally
aware that when he would be coming, and he never found any of them working without full-body harness
and lanyard (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 257-59).
            Technical supervisor Darrell Grubbs testified that he tried to get into the field approximately once
a week to make sure his crew was working safely, or to offer them additional instruction (Tr. Vol. I, pp.
181-82).  According to Grubbs, his men did not always know he would be coming (Tr. Vol. I, p. 182). 
Grubbs stated that he never observed any safety violations serious enough to warrant disciplinary action
(Tr. Vol. I, p. 182).  
Alleged Violations
            Serious citation 1, item 1 alleges:
29 CFR 1910.268(c):
a)        At the jobsite; Employees have not been certified to operate the bucket on the Ford F-450, model
AT200A, serial number 0300BV6056, exposing employees to the hazard of falling out of the
bucket to death.

            The cited standard provides:
 
Training.  Employers shall provide training in the various precautions and safe practices
described in this section and shall insure that employees do not engage in the activities to
which this section applies until such employees have received proper training in the various
precautions and safe practices required by this section. . . . Where training is required, it
shall consist of on-the-job training or classroom type training or a combination of both. 
The employer shall certify that employees have been trained by preparing a certification
record which includes the identity of the person trained, the signature of the employer or
the person who conducted the training, and the date the training was completed.  The
certification record shall be prepared at the completion of training and shall be maintained
on file for the duration of the employee’s employment. . . . 

Discussion
            Respondent admits that employees were not certified to operate the bucket of the Ford F-450 (Tr.
Vol. I, pp. 15-16).  Respondent stipulates that the only questions to be litigated are: 1) whether the
violation was properly classified as “serious,” and 2) whether the proposed penalty of $4,500.00 is
appropriate (Tr. Vol. I, p. 16).  Respondent argues that the mere failure to certify that an employee has been
trained, where that employee actually received training, cannot, in itself, result in serious injury or death. 

            The citation at issue charges Respondent with failure to comply with the training requirements at
§1910.268(c), as set forth above.  The cited section requires that employees be trained in safe practices
applicable to the telecommunications industry.  The citation specifically refers to precautions necessary
to prevent an employee from falling from the elevated bucket of the Ford F-450 bucket truck.   It is clear
from the evidence adduced at the hearing that Respondent’s failure to produce any records certifying that
Mr. Miskovic received any training initially led to Marcus’ citation under §1910.268.  Based on the
evidence adduced at the hearing, however, it is clear that Complainant intended to charge Marcus with
failing to adequately train its employees to use fall protection, as is required under the cited section.  The
issue of whether Jurica Miskovic was adequately trained to use a harness and lanyard when working from
the bucket truck was also fully addressed by Respondent.  As the training issue was fully tried by the
parties, it is properly before this judge.  
            The evidence shows that Marcus provided on-the-job training to new system techs, having them
work with more experienced technicians.  None of the testimony, however, establishes that training in fall
protection was included in that training.  It is clear from the record that safety training was not the main
focus when new technicians rode along with more experienced techs.  The main purpose of every trip out
was to accomplish the work assigned to the experienced technician.  Any training the apprentice technician
received was incidental to the specific job to be performed.  Thus a new technician might, or might not
receive instruction on the use of fall protection, depending on the nature of the jobs he rode along on.
            Nonetheless, the record establishes that Marcus did have a safety policy requiring the use of
harnesses and lanyards while working from a bucket, and that the policy was communicated to employees
at regular Wednesday morning meetings.  Jurica Miskovic was present for at least two meetings where the
use of fall protection was discussed.  Though uniformly eschewing the rule, the testifying employees were
aware of its existence.  The Commission has recently held that an employer’s failure to enforce compliance
with work rules on the job does not establish a failure to train. N & N Contractors, Inc. 18 BNA OSHC
2121, 2000 CCH OSHD ¶32,101 (No. 96-0606, 2000).  In this case, the record does not establish that
Marcus  failed to provide the training required under §1910.268(c), only that Marcus failed to effectively
enforce that training.  Nonetheless, as Marcus admits, Marcus was in technical violation of §1910.268 in
that it failed to certify each employee’s training.  
Penalty 
            This judge agrees that a failure to certify training that was, in fact, received by employees, is not
likely to result in either serious injury or death.  The citation, therefore, will be affirmed as an “other than
serious” violation.  It is well established that in determining an appropriate penalty, the gravity of the
offense is the principle factor to be considered.  Nacirema Operating Co., 1 BNA OSHC 1001, 1972 CCH
OSHD ¶15,032 (No. 4, 1972).  Because there is little probability that the proven violation would result in
injury  to employees, a penalty of $500.00 is deemed appropriate, and is assessed.
            Serious citation 1, item 2 alleges:
29 CFR 1910.268(e):
a)        At the jobsite; Employer did not ensure that employees are wearing safety harnesses whenever
inside the bucket of the Ford F-450, model AT200A, serial number 0300BV6056, exposing
employees to the hazard of falling out of the bucket to death.

            The cited standard provides:
 
Tools and personal protective equipment.  Personal protective equipment, protective
devices and special tools needed for the work of employees shall be provided and the
employer shall ensure that they are used by employees. . . .

Facts
            Respondent admits that the cited standard applies, that it was violated, and that Mr. Miskovic was
exposed to the hazard.  Marcus denies, however, that it had knowledge of the violation.  Marcus further
raises the affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct (Tr. Vol. I, p. 16-17). 
Discussion
            Knowledge.  In order to show employer knowledge of a violation the Secretary must show that the
employer knew, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known of a hazardous condition. 
Atlantic Battery Co., 16 BNA OSHA 2131, 2138 (No. 90-1747, 1994); Dun Par Engd. Form Co., 12 BNA
OSHC 1962, 1986-87 CCH OSHD ¶27,651 (No. 82-928, 1986).  Constructive knowledge may be
predicated on an employer's failure to establish an adequate program to promote compliance with safety
standards. New York State Elec. & Gas Corp. 88 F.3d 98, (2nd Cir. 1996).  The fact that [the employer]
may not have known of the specific instance of violative conduct at the time it occurred does not mean that
that conduct was unpreventable.  Ormet Corp., 14 BNA OSHC 2134, 2138-39, 1991-93 CCH OSHD
¶29,254, p. 39,203 (No. 85-531, 1991).  Reasonable diligence includes adequate supervision of employees
as well as the formulation and implementation of work rules and training programs designed to ensure that
employees perform their work safely.  See; Mosser Construction Co., 15 BNA OSHC 1408, 1991-93 CCH
OSHD ¶29,546 (No. 89-1027, 1991); Gary Concrete Prod., Inc., 15 BNA OSHC 1051, 1991-93 CCH
OSHD ¶29,344 (No. 86-1087, 1991).  It is clear that Marcus’ safety program was not designed to ensure
that its employees utilized fall protection unless a supervisor would actually be watching.  Rather the
evidence establishes that Marcus’ fall protection program was uniformly ignored by its employees, unless,
a  technician knew that a supervisor would be at his work site.  Unanimity of noncomplying conduct by
all employees strongly suggests ineffective enforcement  Gem Industrial, Inc. 17 BNA OSHC 1861, 1865,
1996 CCH OSHD ¶31,197 (No. 93-1122, 1996).  Marcus could easily have instituted measures designed
to discover violations of the fall protection rules, such as requiring supervisory personnel to conduct
regular surprise inspections of technicians performing aerial work  See, Pride Oil Well Serv., 15 BNA
OSHC 1809, 1991-93 CCH OSHD ¶29,807 (No. 87-692, 1992).  Supervisors made virtually no
unannounced inspections, and, consequently Marcus remained unaware that employees eschewed the use
of fall protection.  The Secretary has established that Marcus’ constructive knowledge.
            Employee Misconduct.  To prove that a violative condition resulted from unpreventable employee
misconduct, the employer must show that it had a work rule that effectively implemented the requirements
of the cited standard and that the work rule was adequately communicated and effectively enforced. Gary
Concrete Prods., 15 BNA OSHC 1051, 1055, 1991-93 CCH OSHD ¶29,344, p. 39,452 (No. 86-1087,
1991).  The defense fails here for the same reason that Marcus was found to have constructive knowledge
of the violation. See, Danis Shook, 19 BNA OSHC 1497, 2001 CCH OSHD ¶32,397 (No. 98-1192, 2001). 
Marcus had a work rule, but it did little to implement or enforce the rule. Therefore, the defense fails. 
Penalty
            Respondent stipulates that, should a violation be found, the classification and proposed penalty are
appropriate (Tr. Vol. I, p. 17).  The proposed penalty of $4,500.00 is, therefore, affirmed.

    
 
ORDER
1.         Citation 1, item 1, alleging violation of 29 CFR §1910.268(c) is AFFIRMED as an “other than
serious” violation and a penalty of $500.00 is ASSESSED.
2.         Citation 1, item 2, alleging violation of 29 CFR §1910.268(e) is AFFIRMED as a serious violation
and a penalty of $4,500.00 is ASSESSED

OPINION
JONES, District Judge.
The principal question in this case is whether under Virginia law a municipality may operate a cable television system in competition with private companies. One of the competing cable companies argues that absence additional state legislation, the City of Bristol is legally unable to enter the cable television business. After careful consideration, I agree and will prohibit the City from operating a cable system.
There are important questions that I do not decide. One question is whether cable customers in Bristol are likely to have better and cheaper cable service with additional competition from the City. Perhaps they are. Another question is whether it is fair for a taxpayer-supported entity like the City to compete with private enterprise. Perhaps it is not. Under our system of government, however, these policy questions are for the legislature to decide, and not the courts. 
I
Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C., doing business as Charter Communications (Charter), filed this action on November 18, 2002, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the City of Bristol, Virginia, doing business as Bristol Virginia Utilities Board (the City). Charter, the operator of a cable television system by virtue of a franchise from the City, alleged that the City was now preparing to offer cable television services to its residents via a fiber optic network that it has constructed. *677 Charter asserts that the operation of this cable television system by the City is unlawful, both because state law does not grant the City the legal authority to do so, and because the City failed to comply with state law in granting itself a cable franchise. Jurisdiction of this court is based on diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.[1]
After a hearing, the court granted a temporary restraining order on November 22, 2002, prohibiting the City from beginning general operation of its cable television system until a hearing and decision on Charter's request for a preliminary injunction. Thereafter, the parties agreed that their interests and that of the public required an expedited decision and that a trial on the merits could be held in lieu of a hearing on preliminary relief.[2] On December 9, 2002, the court received evidence and argument of counsel and the case was submitted for final decision.[3] 
II 
A
As required by the rules,[4] the following are my findings of fact.
1. Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C., is a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is a Delaware entity and whose principal place of business is other than in Virginia. The City of Bristol, Virginia, is a Virginia municipality located in this judicial district. The amount in controversy in this case exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of $75,000.
2. Charter operates a cable television system within the City pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise granted by the City dated November 13, 1991, to a predecessor operator. Charter currently serves approximately 5,800 subscribers located in the City. Through its affiliated companies, Charter has 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 subscribers nationwide. Since 1998, Charter has made capital expenditures of $5,000,000 to $9,000,000 for its Bristol system. While another cable television operator, Comcast Communications, operates in the City, Charter and Comcast do not compete in the same geographical areas of the City. In this regard, Bristol is typical of the cable industry in that cable providers generally do not "overbuild" the same geographical areas in smaller markets because of the large capital cost necessary to deliver cable television. The principal competitors to cable television operators are normally local television broadcasters and direct broadcast satellite services.
3. The City has for some time provided electric power, water, and sewer services to its citizens and residents of adjoining areas through its department known as Bristol Virginia Utilities. The department *678 is operated by an entity known as Bristol Virginia Utilities Board, which is not independent of the City Council. The City recently constructed a fiber optic network and made plans to provide cable television, telephone, high-speed Internet, and home-security services through this network. On June 11, 2002, the City Council approved an ordinance granting a nonexclusive franchise to Bristol Virginia Utilities Board to construct and operate a cable television system. No public hearing was held with respect to this action, and no prior notice was given to Charter, although the City's plans to provide cable television had been the subject of prior press releases and newspaper articles. Had a hearing been held before the City Council's action, Charter would have appeared and voiced its opposition.
4. The franchise that the City in effect granted to itself differs in significant ways from Charter's franchise. In particular, Charter's franchise contains a pole attachment fee and requirements that the City's franchise recites will be included in a later-negotiated agreement. Charter's franchise contains a detailed definition of gross receipts in order to determine the amount of franchise fees to be paid to the City, while the City's franchise does not contain such a definition.
5. The City initially offered cable television service to a small limited number of subscribers known as "beta testers" and planned to roll out its general cable service beginning December 2, 2002, had not this court enjoined such action. Twenty-seven Charter cable subscribers have already advised Charter that they will leave Charter in order to obtain the City's cable service. Charter has had experience in other states from municipal overbuilding and generally loses from twenty to thirty percent of its subscribers to the competing municipal operator, which loss is generally permanent. The City's own research indicates that almost three-quarters of residential and business customers surveyed in Bristol in October of 2002 expressed an interest in switching from their current cable or telephone provider to the City. 
B
The City concedes that no provision of Virginia law expressly grants it authority to engage in the cable television business. It argues, however, that it has implied authority to do so.
Virginia, like some other states, follows the so-called Dillon Rule, named after John Dillon, a judge of the Iowa Supreme Court, who first proposed it in 1868.[5] As formulated in Virginia, the Dillon Rule establishes that political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, such as cities, have only those powers expressly granted by state law or necessarily implied from express powers.[6] When doubtful, the question of whether a municipality has a particular power must be answered in the negative.[7] The Dillon Rule, in short, requires a narrow and strict interpretation of all powers conferred on local government in Virginia.
While the Virginia legislature has authorized localities to establish and operate "waterworks, sewerage, gas works (natural or manufactured), electric plants, public mass transportation systems, stormwater management systems and other public utilities,"[8] I agree with the most recent *679 opinion of the Attorney General of Virginia that these words do not necessarily imply the operation of a cable television system since such systems have not "historically been provided by Virginia local government, and ... are clearly not within the common meaning of the term `public utility.'"[9] That is clearly the weight of authority in other Dillon Rule states.[10] As noted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, such services cannot be included within the definition of a public utility because "the value and necessity of cable television is [not] so self-evident that this court should declare that a cable television system provides an essential service."[11] Nor does the federal Cable Act grant any express power to localities to operate a cable system.[12] While the City's charter from the legislature authorizes it to operate a "utility,"[13] I reject the argument by the City that any broader scope of power is implied by that word as compared to the words "public utility."
There is an additional statute of general application that provides localities the authority to exercise functions "necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare."[14] This statute is limited, however, to those powers granted by state law.[15] Otherwise, there would be no limit to the powers of a municipality. If the City's argument based on this statute were correct, it could legally operate grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, pet-grooming businesses, and more, since all of these enterprises doubtless provide "desirable" services.
In 2002 the Virginia legislature adopted a statute allowing localities to offer "qualifying communications services" subject to the approval of the State Corporation Commission.[16] The City does not rely on this statute and has not sought approval by the Commission for its proposed cable services. Nevertheless, it points to the statute's legislative history showing that an earlier version not enacted contained language expressly excluding cable television from the definition of "qualifying communications services." Relying on a declaration by William C. Wampler, Jr., a Virginia state senator whose district includes Bristol and who was the sponsor of the legislation, the City argues that the removal of the exclusion language shows a recognition by the legislature that municipalities have the existing power to offer cable services. Charter in turn has filed a declaration by an industry lobbyist disputing such intent.
*680 State legislative history is often of low reliability in statutory construction because of the absence of verbatim reports of debates and floor statements.[17] While the statements of a principal sponsor as to the meaning of legislation may be helpful, it is those statements made to the legislature before adoption of the legislation that are relevant, since such remarks may illuminate the legislature's intent in passing the bill.[18] Under the circumstances, I cannot find any unambiguous meaning in the legislature's exclusion of the language in question.[19]
The City also cites another new provision of state law authorizing localities that operate electrical distribution systems (as the City does) to offer "telecommunications services" after obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the State Corporation Commission.[20] The Commission is empowered to grant such a certificate to a locality that "propos[es] to furnish local exchange telephone service in the Commonwealth."[21] The new statute also provides that "[n]o locality providing such services shall acquire by eminent domain the facilities or other property of any telecommunications service provider to offer cable, telephone, data transmission or other information or online programming services."[22] The parties dispute the meaning of this language and I cannot find that it clearly indicates a recognition that Virginia law permits localities to offer cable services. 
C
In summary, I find that the Dillon Rule prohibits the City from operating a cable television system.[23] It can doubtless be argued that localities in Virginia ought to be freed from the restrictions of this nineteenth century legal formulation and the citizens of Bristol allowed to decide if they want their local government to engage in cable television services. However I might feel personally about the wisdom of existing legal rules, I am bound to apply them. Nevertheless, the City has a direct if uncertain remedy  it can ask Virginia's General Assembly and Governor to adopt legislation that plainly authorizes it to operate a cable television system. 
D
For the foregoing reasons, I reach the following conclusions of law.
1. The court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this case and of the parties;
2. An actual controversy exists as to the City's legal authority to operate a television cable system under Virginia law;
3. Charter is likely to suffer actual and substantial harm in the event the City *681 operates a television cable system in competition with Charter;
4. The City does not have the legal authority to operate a television cable system because such authority is not expressly granted by Virginia law or necessarily implied from such express powers so granted; and
5. Charter is entitled to a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the City from operating a cable television system.
A separate judgment in accord with this opinion will be entered herewith.
NOTES
[1]  See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332(a) (West 1993 & Supp.2002).
[2]  The City initially argued that Charter had no standing under state law to contest the City's authority to grant a franchise to a competing cable system. However, the City has now expressly waived any such argument. I have the duty to ascertain sua sponte the standing of a party under the Constitution's grant of power to the federal courts to resolve "cases" and "controversies." U.S. Const. art. III. Since it is clear that Charter will likely suffer actual injury traceable to the City's action and that this injury will be redressed by the court's decision, constitutional standing is present. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000).
[3]  The City has not filed a formal answer to the Complaint, but in the interest of time the parties stipulated that no such answer would be required and that the defendant was deemed to have denied the substantive allegations of the Complaint.
[4]  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).
[5]  See Merriam v. Moody's Ex'rs, 25 Iowa 163, 170 (1868).

[9]  1995 Va. Op. Att'y Gen. 93, 1995 WL 370732, at *1 (1995) (Attorney General James S. Gilmore, III).
[10]  See Steven C. Carlson, A Historical, Economic, and Legal Analysis of Municipal Ownership of the Information Highway, 25 Rutgers Computer & Tech. L.J. 1, 54-55 (1999) (discussing cases). My opinion in City of Bristol v. Earley, 145 F. Supp. 2d 741 (W.D.Va.2001), is not to the contrary. In that case, the issue was whether the state legislature could expressly prohibit a locality from providing telecommunications services in the face of federal legislation to the contrary. I found that the City had the power to sue to enforce its federal right because it was expressly authorized by state law to provide telephone services. Id. at 745. No issue involving the power to provide cable television under the Dillon Rule was presented in that case.
[11]  Sheppard v. City of Orangeburg, 314 S.C. 240, 442 S.E.2d 601, 603 (1994).
[12]  See Warner Cable Communications, Inc. v. Borough of Schuylkill Haven, 784 F. Supp. 203, 213-14 (E.D.Pa. 1992).
[13]  1990 Va. Acts ch. 542 § 2.04(8).
[14]  Va.Code Ann. § 15.2-1102 (Michie 1997).
[15]  Id.
[16]  Va.Code Ann. § 56-484.7:1 (Michie Supp. 2002).
[17]  See William N. Eskridge, Jr., et al., Legislation and Statutory Interpretation 297 (2000).
[18]  See United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO-CLC v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 241, 99 S. Ct. 2721, 61 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).
[19]  See Eskridge, supra note 17, at 305 (discussing authority that rejected-proposal evidence is unpersuasive if "the reasons for rejection were unclear.").
[20]  Va.Code Ann. § 15.2-2160 (Michie Supp. 2002).
[21]  Va.Code Ann. § 56-265.4:4 (Michie Supp. 2002).
[22]  Va.Code Ann. § 15.2-2160(E) (Michie Supp.2002).
[23]  Since I find that the City is not authorized to operate a cable television system, it is unnecessary for me to determine the other grounds asserted as to the invalidity of the City's action.

OPINION
JONES, District Judge.
The principal question in this case is whether under Virginia law a municipality may operate a cable television system in competition with private companies. One of the competing cable companies argues that absence additional state legislation, the City of Bristol is legally unable to enter the cable television business. After careful consideration, I agree and will prohibit the City from operating a cable system.
There are important questions that I do not decide. One question is whether cable customers in Bristol are likely to have better and cheaper cable service with additional competition from the City. Perhaps they are. Another question is whether it is fair for a taxpayer-supported entity like the City to compete with private enterprise. Perhaps it is not. Under our system of government, however, these policy questions are for the legislature to decide, and not the courts.

I
Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C., doing business as Charter Communications (Charter), filed this action on November 18, 2002, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the City of Bristol, Virginia, doing business as Bristol Virginia Utilities Board (the City). Charter, the operator of a cable television system by virtue of a franchise from the City, alleged that the City was now preparing to offer cable television services to its residents via a fiber optic network that it has constructed. *677 Charter asserts that the operation of this cable television system by the City is unlawful, both because state law does not grant the City the legal authority to do so, and because the City failed to comply with state law in granting itself a cable franchise. Jurisdiction of this court is based on diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.[1]
After a hearing, the court granted a temporary restraining order on November 22, 2002, prohibiting the City from beginning general operation of its cable television system until a hearing and decision on Charter's request for a preliminary injunction. Thereafter, the parties agreed that their interests and that of the public required an expedited decision and that a trial on the merits could be held in lieu of a hearing on preliminary relief.[2] On December 9, 2002, the court received evidence and argument of counsel and the case was submitted for final decision.[3]

II

A
As required by the rules,[4] the following are my findings of fact.
1. Marcus Cable Associates, L.L.C., is a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is a Delaware entity and whose principal place of business is other than in Virginia. The City of Bristol, Virginia, is a Virginia municipality located in this judicial district. The amount in controversy in this case exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of $75,000.
2. Charter operates a cable television system within the City pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise granted by the City dated November 13, 1991, to a predecessor operator. Charter currently serves approximately 5,800 subscribers located in the City. Through its affiliated companies, Charter has 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 subscribers nationwide. Since 1998, Charter has made capital expenditures of $5,000,000 to $9,000,000 for its Bristol system. While another cable television operator, Comcast Communications, operates in the City, Charter and Comcast do not compete in the same geographical areas of the City. In this regard, Bristol is typical of the cable industry in that cable providers generally do not "overbuild" the same geographical areas in smaller markets because of the large capital cost necessary to deliver cable television. The principal competitors to cable television operators are normally local television broadcasters and direct broadcast satellite services.
3. The City has for some time provided electric power, water, and sewer services to its citizens and residents of adjoining areas through its department known as Bristol Virginia Utilities. The department *678 is operated by an entity known as Bristol Virginia Utilities Board, which is not independent of the City Council. The City recently constructed a fiber optic network and made plans to provide cable television, telephone, high-speed Internet, and home-security services through this network. On June 11, 2002, the City Council approved an ordinance granting a nonexclusive franchise to Bristol Virginia Utilities Board to construct and operate a cable television system. No public hearing was held with respect to this action, and no prior notice was given to Charter, although the City's plans to provide cable television had been the subject of prior press releases and newspaper articles. Had a hearing been held before the City Council's action, Charter would have appeared and voiced its opposition.
4. The franchise that the City in effect granted to itself differs in significant ways from Charter's franchise. In particular, Charter's franchise contains a pole attachment fee and requirements that the City's franchise recites will be included in a later-negotiated agreement. Charter's franchise contains a detailed definition of gross receipts in order to determine the amount of franchise fees to be paid to the City, while the City's franchise does not contain such a definition.
5. The City initially offered cable television service to a small limited number of subscribers known as "beta testers" and planned to roll out its general cable service beginning December 2, 2002, had not this court enjoined such action. Twenty-seven Charter cable subscribers have already advised Charter that they will leave Charter in order to obtain the City's cable service. Charter has had experience in other states from municipal overbuilding and generally loses from twenty to thirty percent of its subscribers to the competing municipal operator, which loss is generally permanent. The City's own research indicates that almost three-quarters of residential and business customers surveyed in Bristol in October of 2002 expressed an interest in switching from their current cable or telephone provider to the City.

B
The City concedes that no provision of Virginia law expressly grants it authority to engage in the cable television business. It argues, however, that it has implied authority to do so.
Virginia, like some other states, follows the so-called Dillon Rule, named after John Dillon, a judge of the Iowa Supreme Court, who first proposed it in 1868.[5] As formulated in Virginia, the Dillon Rule establishes that political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, such as cities, have only those powers expressly granted by state law or necessarily implied from express powers.[6] When doubtful, the question of whether a municipality has a particular power must be answered in the negative.[7] The Dillon Rule, in short, requires a narrow and strict interpretation of all powers conferred on local government in Virginia.
While the Virginia legislature has authorized localities to establish and operate "waterworks, sewerage, gas works (natural or manufactured), electric plants, public mass transportation systems, stormwater management systems and other public utilities,"[8] I agree with the most recent *679 opinion of the Attorney General of Virginia that these words do not necessarily imply the operation of a cable television system since such systems have not "historically been provided by Virginia local government, and ... are clearly not within the common meaning of the term `public utility.'"[9] That is clearly the weight of authority in other Dillon Rule states.[10] As noted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, such services cannot be included within the definition of a public utility because "the value and necessity of cable television is [not] so self-evident that this court should declare that a cable television system provides an essential service."[11] Nor does the federal Cable Act grant any express power to localities to operate a cable system.[12] While the City's charter from the legislature authorizes it to operate a "utility,"[13] I reject the argument by the City that any broader scope of power is implied by that word as compared to the words "public utility."
There is an additional statute of general application that provides localities the authority to exercise functions "necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare."[14] This statute is limited, however, to those powers granted by state law.[15] Otherwise, there would be no limit to the powers of a municipality. If the City's argument based on this statute were correct, it could legally operate grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, pet-grooming businesses, and more, since all of these enterprises doubtless provide "desirable" services.
In 2002 the Virginia legislature adopted a statute allowing localities to offer "qualifying communications services" subject to the approval of the State Corporation Commission.[16] The City does not rely on this statute and has not sought approval by the Commission for its proposed cable services. Nevertheless, it points to the statute's legislative history showing that an earlier version not enacted contained language expressly excluding cable television from the definition of "qualifying communications services." Relying on a declaration by William C. Wampler, Jr., a Virginia state senator whose district includes Bristol and who was the sponsor of the legislation, the City argues that the removal of the exclusion language shows a recognition by the legislature that municipalities have the existing power to offer cable services. Charter in turn has filed a declaration by an industry lobbyist disputing such intent.
*680 State legislative history is often of low reliability in statutory construction because of the absence of verbatim reports of debates and floor statements.[17] While the statements of a principal sponsor as to the meaning of legislation may be helpful, it is those statements made to the legislature before adoption of the legislation that are relevant, since such remarks may illuminate the legislature's intent in passing the bill.[18] Under the circumstances, I cannot find any unambiguous meaning in the legislature's exclusion of the language in question.[19]
The City also cites another new provision of state law authorizing localities that operate electrical distribution systems (as the City does) to offer "telecommunications services" after obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the State Corporation Commission.[20] The Commission is empowered to grant such a certificate to a locality that "propos[es] to furnish local exchange telephone service in the Commonwealth."[21] The new statute also provides that "[n]o locality providing such services shall acquire by eminent domain the facilities or other property of any telecommunications service provider to offer cable, telephone, data transmission or other information or online programming services."[22] The parties dispute the meaning of this language and I cannot find that it clearly indicates a recognition that Virginia law permits localities to offer cable services.

C
In summary, I find that the Dillon Rule prohibits the City from operating a cable television system.[23] It can doubtless be argued that localities in Virginia ought to be freed from the restrictions of this nineteenth century legal formulation and the citizens of Bristol allowed to decide if they want their local government to engage in cable television services. However I might feel personally about the wisdom of existing legal rules, I am bound to apply them. Nevertheless, the City has a direct if uncertain remedy  it can ask Virginia's General Assembly and Governor to adopt legislation that plainly authorizes it to operate a cable television system.

D
For the foregoing reasons, I reach the following conclusions of law.
1. The court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this case and of the parties;
2. An actual controversy exists as to the City's legal authority to operate a television cable system under Virginia law;
3. Charter is likely to suffer actual and substantial harm in the event the City *681 operates a television cable system in competition with Charter;
4. The City does not have the legal authority to operate a television cable system because such authority is not expressly granted by Virginia law or necessarily implied from such express powers so granted; and
5. Charter is entitled to a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the City from operating a cable television system.
A separate judgment in accord with this opinion will be entered herewith.
NOTES
[1]  See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1332(a) (West 1993 & Supp.2002).
[2]  The City initially argued that Charter had no standing under state law to contest the City's authority to grant a franchise to a competing cable system. However, the City has now expressly waived any such argument. I have the duty to ascertain sua sponte the standing of a party under the Constitution's grant of power to the federal courts to resolve "cases" and "controversies." U.S. Const. art. III. Since it is clear that Charter will likely suffer actual injury traceable to the City's action and that this injury will be redressed by the court's decision, constitutional standing is present. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000).
[3]  The City has not filed a formal answer to the Complaint, but in the interest of time the parties stipulated that no such answer would be required and that the defendant was deemed to have denied the substantive allegations of the Complaint.

[10]  See Steven C. Carlson, A Historical, Economic, and Legal Analysis of Municipal Ownership of the Information Highway, 25 Rutgers Computer & Tech. L.J. 1, 54-55 (1999) (discussing cases). My opinion in City of Bristol v. Earley, 145 F. Supp. 2d 741 (W.D.Va.2001), is not to the contrary. In that case, the issue was whether the state legislature could expressly prohibit a locality from providing telecommunications services in the face of federal legislation to the contrary. I found that the City had the power to sue to enforce its federal right because it was expressly authorized by state law to provide telephone services. Id. at 745. No issue involving the power to provide cable television under the Dillon Rule was presented in that case.

[19]  See Eskridge, supra note 17, at 305 (discussing authority that rejected-proposal evidence is unpersuasive if "the reasons for rejection were unclear.").
[20]  Va.Code Ann. § 15.2-2160 (Michie Supp. 2002).
[21]  Va.Code Ann. § 56-265.4:4 (Michie Supp. 2002).
[22]  Va.Code Ann. § 15.2-2160(E) (Michie Supp.2002).
[23]  Since I find that the City is not authorized to operate a cable television system, it is unnecessary for me to determine the other grounds asserted as to the invalidity of the City's action.
