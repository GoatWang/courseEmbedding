ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen,

As of
June 1, 2016


Introduction to Portfolio Overview

 

We are
pleased to present ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund
Fourteen, L.P.’s (the “Fund”) Portfolio Overview
for quarter ended March 31, 2016. References to “we,”
“us,” and “our” are references to the Fund,
references to the “General Partner” are references to
the general partner of the Fund, ICON GP 14, LLC, and references to
the “Investment Manager” are references to the
investment manager of the Fund, ICON Capital, LLC.

 

The Fund
makes investments in companies that utilize equipment and other
corporate infrastructure (collectively, “Capital
Assets”) to operate their businesses. These investments are
primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings (such as
loans and leases) that are collateralized by Capital
Assets.

 

The Fund
raised $257,646,987 commencing with its initial offering on May 18,
2009 through the closing of the offering on May 18, 2011. The Fund
entered into its liquidation period on May 19, 2016. During the
liquidation period, the Fund began the orderly termination of its
operations and has began, and will continue, to gradually dispose
of its assets and/or allow its investments to mature in the
ordinary course of business. If our Investment Manager believes it
would benefit our partners to reinvest the proceeds received from
sold or matured investments in additional investments during the
liquidation period, our Investment Manager may do so. Our
Investment Manager is not paid acquisition fees or management fees
for additional investments initiated during the liquidation
period.

Portfolio Overview (Continued)

 

(1)
Net
carrying value of our investment in note receivable is the sum of
the remaining principal outstanding and the unamortized initial
direct costs, less deferred fees.

(2)
Leased
equipment at cost is the cost of the equipment and initial direct
costs, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization.
Net carrying value of our investment in leased equipment at cost is
leased equipment at cost less any outstanding indebtedness
associated with the investment.

(3)
Investment
in finance lease is the sum of the remaining minimum lease payments
receivable, the estimated residual value of the asset and the
unamortized initial direct costs, less unearned income. Net
carrying value is our investment in finance lease less any
outstanding indebtedness associated with the investment.

(4)
This
investment is through a joint venture that we consolidated and
presented on our consolidated balance sheets as leased equipment at
cost. Leased equipment at cost is the cost of the equipment and
initial direct costs, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
amortization. Net carrying value represents our proportionate share
of the investment, less any outstanding indebtedness associated
with the investment and includes the recognition of an investment
by noncontrolling interests for the share of such investment held
by the joint venture’s noncontrolling interest
holders.

(5)
Net
carrying value of our investment in joint ventures is calculated as
follows: investment at cost plus/less our share of the cumulative
net income/loss of the joint venture and less distributions
received since the date of our initial investment.

(6)
This
investment is through a joint venture that we consolidated and
presented on our consolidated balance sheets as investment in note
receivable. Investment in note receivable is the sum of the
remaining principal outstanding and the unamortized initial direct
costs, less deferred fees. Net carrying value represents our
proportionate share of the investment and includes the recognition
of an investment by noncontrolling interests for the share of such
investment held by the joint venture’s noncontrolling
interest holders.

 


 


 


Discussion

 

Jurong
Aromatics Corporation Pte. Ltd.

Jurong
Aromatics Corporation Pte. Ltd. (“Jurong”) is a newly
constructed $2 billion state-of-the art aromatics plant. We
participated in a subordinated equipment loan in April 2011
alongside Standard Chartered Bank and BP Singapore Pte. Ltd., that
was part of the $2 billion financing package that included over
$500 million in equity from strategic investors. While the plant
was completed on time, a combination of industry headwinds,
downturn in commodities and the Chinese economic slowdown forced
Jurong into receivership, as the company does not have the
liquidity to commence operations. As part of the receivership, we
are hoping that there will be a consensual restructuring with the
senior lenders, shareholders and trade creditors. Given the current
distressed situation, we have taken a credit reserve that values
the asset at 11% of original cost. Our Investment Manager believes
that a restructuring is the best option and, given the cyclical
nature of the industry that Jurong participates in, and the fact
that this a state-of-the-art plant, if margins follow historical
patterns, there is a chance the investment may recover some or all
of its value.

 

Geden
Holdings Limited

Geden
Lines (“Geden”) is an international shipping company
based in Turkey.  We entered into a sale-leaseback with Geden
for one tanker, the Center, and two dry bulkers, the Amazing and
Fantastic. While the tanker market has recovered and the outlook is
stable, there are extreme headwinds facing the dry bulk market,
mostly as a result of the slowdown in the Chinese economy, which
for years was driven by heavy investment that fueled ton mile
demand for steel, coal and iron ore.  As China moves towards a
consumer-driven economy, demand for these commodities has slowed
significantly. In April 2016, we were informed by Geden that it
intends to return the three vessels to us prior to lease expiration
and that it will not be fulfilling its purchase obligations with
respect to the three vessels. As a result, we determined to record
credit losses of $4,804,077, $4,641,478 and $396,762 related to the
Amazing, the Fantastic and the Center, respectively, during the
three months ended March 31, 2016 based primarily on the current
fair market value of the vessels. In anticipation of Geden
returning the three vessels to us prior to lease expiration, we
recently signed a term sheet for a proposed charter with respect to
the Amazing and the Fantastic that will provide us revenue sharing
in the charterer's proprietary book of cargo and we are engaging
Stena Bulk AB to operate the Center in the Stena Sonangol Suezmax
Pool. We have also signed term sheets to restructure the debt on
these vessels.  Since the vessels are young and these sectors
have historically been highly cyclical, we believe these vessels
could still recover in value.
