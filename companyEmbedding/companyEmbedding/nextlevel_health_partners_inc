AppExchange Partners (ISVs) participating in nextlevel Partner Finder should complete the submission form in the left hand nav of the nextlevel for Partners Group, and create a unique submission for each application currently under contract in the AppExchange Partner Program. 



Q: As an eligible partner, how do I submit information for my nextlevel Partner Finder listing? 


A: If you are a Consulting partner, your listing will be created automatically once you’ve earned a specialization or cloud master designation. If you are an AppExchange Partner (ISV) and have been invited to participate in the nextlevel program, fill out the nextlevel partner finder submission form in the left hand nav of the nextlevel for Partners Group. Once complete, submit it to the nextlevel team to ensure you have a listing for each application currently under contract.  




Q: How do I update my information if something has changed since my initial submission? 


A: If you are a Consulting partner, the only changes that will require notification are changes to business contacts for a specific region or industry. If this is the case, please send those updates to nextlevel@salesforce.com. If you are an AppExchange Partner (ISV), you can resubmit the submission form found in the left hand nav of the  nextlevel for Partners Group make changes to your nextlevel Partner Finder listing.




Q: Who can I contact if I'm not eligible but I have questions about the program?


A: Contact the nextlevel team.




Q: What is the best way to stay up-to-date on nextlevel and be informed of any changes or enhancements to the initiative? 


A: Join the  nextlevel for Partners Group for regular updates on new listing information, enhancements, and updated metrics on the program.
