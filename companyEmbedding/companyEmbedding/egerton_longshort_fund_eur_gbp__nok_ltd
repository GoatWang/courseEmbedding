ObjectiveTo provide capital growth through direct investment, or indirectly through the use of financial derivative instruments and collective investment schemes, in equity and equity related securities globally including emerging markets.
In order to achieve the objective the Investment Manager will invest in a select portfolio of assets, which it believes offer the best potential for future growth. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in open ended collective investment schemes. The Fund may also, as an ancillary matter, invest in non-equity related collective investment schemes, fixed interest securities, and liquidities. At times where it is considered appropriate, prudent levels of liquidities will be maintained, which may be substantial or even represent (exceptionally) 100% of the Fund assets. The Fund may be exposed to currencies other than the Euro.More ▼FT Lexicon{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{2}For more information, visit the FT LexiconLexicon on this pageExplore our toolsAlertsData archivePortfolioWorld marketsEquities screenerFunds overview
