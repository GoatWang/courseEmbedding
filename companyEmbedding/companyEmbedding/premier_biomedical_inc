Blood Sepsis and Viremia








Blood Sepsis and Viremia
 

About the Disease

Blood Sepsis, also known as Blood Poisoning, is an infection of the blood stream. Sepsis is caused when toxin releasing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, enter the blood. Blood Sepsis is a particularly devastating disease due to the domino-effect of organ shutdown which causes multiple organ failure. Blood Sepsis causes a whole body inflammatory state called Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).
Blood Sepsis first results in the shutdown of kidneys; thus patients require standard dialysis immediately to prevent death. As the disease progresses, vital signs collapse—the foremost of these being blood pressure. Subsequently, symptoms of Sepsis include elevated temperature, elevated heart rate, respiratory collapse, further organ failures, altered mental status and cardiac failure.
Septicemia is a major cause of death in the United States and puts people in the intensive care unit at a very high rate. Only about 1-2% of all hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to Septicemia, though Septicemia accounts for as much as 25% of bed-utilization in intensive-care units.



Conventional Method of Treatment

The traditional therapy of Blood Sepsis relies on intravenous treatment using multiple antibiotics. However, in intensive care units, even with today’s treatment, approximately 35% of patients with severe sepsis and 60% of patients with septic shock die within 30 days.
Septicemia is of particular concern because of the exceedingly high cost of treatment for Septicemia patients. A typical stay in the intensive care unit costs $10,000 per day with testing. Consequently, the treatment of Blood Sepsis is one of the most costly expenditures for hospitals in America.



The Premier Biomedical, Inc. Solution

We hope to conquer Blood Sepsis and Viremia by using our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique method. If proven successful, this technique would dialyze the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood by using antibodies; thus saving countless lives while also providing significant cost savings to hospitals around the country. The method will utilize designer antibodies to physically remove the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood. The designer antibodies will attach to the toxin producing bacteria, and then the antibody-antigen compound will be efficaciously dialyzed out of the blood extracorporeally. We hope to demonstrate this methodology in future lab and animal experiments.

Fibromyalgia








Fibromyalgia
 

About the Disease

Fibromyalgia is a common illness affecting approximately 2% of the general population, most common amongst women 20 to 50 years of age. Approximately five million Americans suffer from the debilitating illness. The cause of Fibromyalgia is officially unknown and diagnosis of Fibromyalgia is a ‘diagnosis of exclusion’—meaning that Fibromyalgia is diagnosed as an illness after Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus have been ruled out with a blood test.
Patients with Fibromyalgia suffer from debilitating fatigue, numbness, headaches, and chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain with multiple tender points. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition lasting 6 months to many years. Patients commonly complain of chronic aching, pain, stiffness, sleep difficulty, headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome. Consequently, approximately 25% of patients with Fibromyalgia are work disabled. The direct and indirect costs of Fibromyalgia are, on average, $5,945 per patient1.

http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm




Conventional Method of Treatment

There are currently only three medications approved by the FDA for treatment of Fibromyalgia: Lyrica® (Pregabalin); Cymbalta® (duloxetine hydrochloride); and Savella® (milnacipran HCI). However, these medications oftentimes have side effects of dizziness, drowsiness and dry mouth. Rarely, these medications can cause suicidal ideation and severe agitation.



The Premier Biomedical, Inc. Solution

Our Feldetrex® candidate drug is designed to compete with currently existing treatments of Fibromyalgia.

   PREMIER BIOMEDICAL, INC (BIEI)  http://www.premierbiomedical.com/  AND    PREMIER BIOMEDICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS https://painreliefmeds.com/    CBD for Relieving Your Pain  What's In Your CBD Matters  Consumers have numerous choices for their pain relief needs, so why should they buy from us?  We manufacture our CBD topical patch to the highest Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. We use only the highest quality natural, organic, certified non-GMO ingredients to produce the highest quality pain relief product. Our proprietary blend of essential oils, and natural enhancers, combined with the highest levels of Cannabidiol (CBD) available anywhere, deliver unprecedented long-lasting relief.  CBD is a natural hemp extract which has been found to contain important medicinal properties. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests CBD possesses a strong OPIOID-FREE medical potential for natural relief from:  Knee Pain  Shoulder Pain  Joint Pain  Pain from Arthritis  Muscle Soreness and Tenderness  Headaches  Migraines  Doctors and patients are finding natural CBD to be an effective analgesic for treating mild to moderately severe pain.  Our pain patch delivers up to 96 hours (4 days) of pain relief. Our patent-pending reservoir patch design features a unique barrier between the foam adhesive and the pain relieving ingredients to ensure that the adhesive is not transmitted and absorbed through the skin, as with many competitive patches. Our formulations contain NO PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENTS, and therefore, will have no effect on drug test results. Our roll-on product consists of the same primary ingredients as contained in our reservoir patch, but in a convenient pocket-size applicator. Our natural enhancers ensure rapid absorption to not only deliver quicker relief, but also reduce the greasy feel.  Additional pain relief products including creams, sprays, gel-pens, and capsules (Pain-ExTM) will follow later in the year.  All of our pain relief products are OPIOID-FREE, and 50-STATE LEGAL.  CURRENT DISTRIBUTORS http://www.premierbiomedical.com/pain-relief-product-distribution-agreements-announced/     PREMIER BIOMEDICAL INC  Premier Biomedical, Inc. has acquired exclusive licenses for patent-pending medications/medical procedures to develop cures for a significant number of the most debilitating and often fatal illnesses affecting mankind: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Clinical Depression, Alzheimer's Disease, Blood Sepsis, Atherosclerosis and Cancer. We have developed an aggressive timetable to advance the development of these breakthrough technologies through laboratory, hospital, and clinical trials. We have initiated the development of potential patient trial application lists. We have a management team with extensive experience and contacts in the medical/pharmaceutical fields as well as a demonstrated track record of launching new business ventures in a competitive environment. Our extensive contacts in the medical/pharmaceutical industries will ensure that new developments will achieve maximum visibility and exposure to the market.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether you�re looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
