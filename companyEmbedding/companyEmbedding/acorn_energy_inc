                            About Us


Acorn Energy, Inc. is a holding company with two portfolio companies: OminiMetrix and DSIT Solutions Ltd. 
OmniMetrix (http://www.omnimetrix.net)- provides systems that offer wireless remote monitoring and control for standby generators, pipelines and other critical equipment. Residential and industrial standby generators as well as turbines, compressors, pumps, pumpjacks, light towers and other industrial equipment are critical infrastructure that’s increasingly becoming monitored in Internet of Things applications. Given that OmniMetrix monitors all major brands of equipment, management believes it is well-positioned to be a competitive participant in this fast growing market. Acorn owns an 80% equity stake in OmniMetrix and consolidates its results of operations
DSIT Solutions Ltd. (www.dsit.co.il) - develops and produces sonar applications for the defense, HLS, energy and commercial markets. The company employs a world-class multi- disciplinary team of professionals that are skilled in the latest sonar and real-time technologies. DSIT products include: The Shield family of Diver Detection Sonars, Anti- Submarine Warfare and Hull Mounted Sonar systems, Portable Acoustic Ranges, Underwater Acoustic Signal Analysis applications and sonar simulators and trainers. Acorn has a 41.2% equity stake in DSIT, and beginning in the second quarter of 2016 no longer consolidates DSIT's results of operations, but instead accounts for its investment in DSIT under the equity method.

Acorn Energy Announces Third Quarter and Nine Month 2015 ResultsBack to ACFN News

Share Story5:25PM ET 11/16/2015 PRNewswire



WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Acorn Energy, Inc. (OTCQB: ACFN), today announced the results for the third quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015.

For the third quarter ended September 30, 2015, revenues were $4.8 million compared to $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2014.  The net loss for the third quarter of 2015 was $2.8 million or $0.10 per share vs. $3.8 million or $0.17 per share in the comparable 2014 period.  Third quarter 2015 loss includes a non-cash impairment charge of $712,000 ($0.03 per share) .
For the nine-month 2015 period, revenues were $14.2 million compared to $14.3 million in the 2014 nine-month period.  The net loss was $8.7 million or $0.33 per share in 2015 vs. $13.7 million or $0.62 per share in 2014.  Nine month 2015 losses include a non-cash impairment charge of $1,562,000 ($0.06 per share). Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $25.2 million.
John Moore, CEO of Acorn Energy said, "Our DSIT business grew revenue and gross profit and continued its second straight quarter of profitability.  DSIT has been very busy around the world conducting demonstrations of its products.  New customer awards have been slowed by the low price of oil that has been punishing our customers that are primarily national oil companies.
In the third quarter GridSense management has made substantial progress in solving operational issues with both our TIQ products and LIQ products in major domestic and international deployments. These repairs cost us substantial cash and had a significant negative impact on our operating results.  In each case we now have referenceable customers and expect follow-on orders in 2016.
OmniMetrix invested heavily in the sales development of our corrosion protection product line and has expanded our customer list.  One of our directors invested $500,000 for a 10% interest in OmniMetrix. This $5 million pre-money valuation for one of our assets is a contrast to the $8 million total enterprise value of Acorn.  The cash from this investment was used as working capital at OmniMetrix and to partially pay down Acorn's loan balance to OmniMetrix.
Both GridSense and OmniMetrix built their sales pipeline which I believe will be the basis of a very strong 2016.
Our liquidity is very tight and we are working to reduce costs and raise additional working capital through additional sales of minority strategic interests in our operating businesses."
DSIT
DSIT, headquartered in Israel, is a leading developer of underwater sonar detection systems to protect harbors, ships and waterside installations, as well as off-shore multi-million dollar oil and gas rigs.  As of September 30, 2015 backlog was $22.7 million.
DSIT revenue for the third quarter increased 8% to $3,616,000 versus the prior year period.  Revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 was up 12% to $10,068,000 compared to the nine month period of the prior year.  Gross profit margins were 38% for the three month period ending September 30, 2015 vs. 34% in 2014.  Gross profit margins were 35% in the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 vs. 28% for the comparable nine months of 2014.
GridSense®
GridSense develops and markets remote monitoring systems for electric utilities worldwide.  The company's focus is on fault detection on powerlines and transformers and the prevention of power outages.
GridSense revenue for the third quarter 2015 was $374,000 as compared to the second quarter 2015 revenue of $702,000.  Nine month revenue in 2015 was $1,984,000 compared to $3,362,000 in the nine months of 2014.  The quarterly and nine-month decreases were a result of reduced backlog entering 2015 combined with a reduced sales force in place in early 2015.  In addition its gross margins decreased to a negative 6% from a positive 28% for the comparable nine month periods.  Gross margins were negatively impacted due to unexpected costs of field repairs of units sold in earlier large deployments, without which, GridSense's margins would have been 35%.
GridSense's management has realigned sales and engineering to focus on those products with the most marketplace traction such as Transformer IQ, the Line IQ and GridInSite.
OmniMetrix®
OmniMetrix has developed the most advanced systems for wirelessly and remotely monitoring back-up generators and devices for monitoring and control of corrosion protection systems on gas pipelines for gas utilities and pipeline companies.  The company generates recurring monitoring revenue from its in-field equipment.  Monitoring revenue represented  68% of 2015 revenue.
Revenue for the nine months was $2,149,000 compared to $2,001,000 in the nine months of 2014.  Third quarter 2015 revenue was $786,000 up 14% compared to $690,000 for second quarter of 2015.
OmniMetrix is in partnership discussions with companies which are marketing to military and government agencies for protecting critical installations with emergency and backup power.  There is an increasing need because of potential attacks, natural disasters and cybersecurity threats.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
