   Hedge Funds-News  Quotient Ltd (QTNT): Bihua Chen’s New Fund, Cormorant Asset Management, Triples Stake    Published on December 5, 2014 at 3:13 pm by  
                                Javier Hasse
                                  in Hedge Funds,News                 Bihua Chen’s Cormorant Asset Management disclosed, last Thursday, that it had tripled its exposure to Quotient Ltd (NASDAQ:QTNT), from 500,000 shares held by the end of the third quarter of 2014, to 1.5 million shares, as of December 4. This position accounts for 8.94% of the company’s shares outstanding. Cormorant Asset Management is a Boston-based healthcare hedge fund founded in 2013. Bihua Chen holds a BS in Genetics and Genetic Engineering, and an MS in Molecular Biology. Prior to founding Cormorant, Ms. Chen served as a Venture Partner at Beacon Bioventures and at Fidelity Biosciences. Before this, she worked for Israel Englander’s Millennium Management. Cormorant had an equity portfolio worth more than $486 million at the end of September 30, 2014.  Quotient Ltd (NASDAQ:QTNT) is a $186.90 million market cap commercial-stage diagnostics company reducing healthcare cost and improving patient care through the development and commercialization of tests for blood grouping and serological disease screening. According to Cormorant’s most recent 13G filing, the firm holds 1.5 million shares of Common Stock. This position, which represents 8.94% of the company’s shares outstanding, is comprised by 1.1 million ordinary shares, and warrants exercisable for 400,000 ordinary shares. Another major institutional investor betting on Quotient Ltd (NASDAQ:QTNT) is Jacob Gottlieb’s Visium Asset Management. The fund had initiated a position in the company, with 745,671 shares, in late-June. Despite having trimmed its wager to half (327,613 shares by the end of the third quarter), Visium is still amongst the largest institutional investors in the company. A few days ago, Quotient Ltd (NASDAQ:QTNT) announced that it had entered into agreements to issue to certain subscribers 2 million ordinary shares for $9.50 per share; and 850,000 pre-funded warrants for $9.49 per warrant, exercisable for up to 850,000 ordinary shares at $0.01 per ordinary share. Gross proceeds for this private placement should be around $27 million, and will be used for general corporate purposes, like funding the development of MosaiQ(TM). A few weeks earlier, the company had reported its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, ended September 30, 2014. Highlights include: total revenue of $4.5 million, almost flat in relation to the same quarter in 2013, and gross profit of $1.8 million, down from $2.2 million in 2013. Despite these relatively poor results, analysts and investors were pleasantly surprised, sending the stock price up. Since earnings were reported, the stock gained about 20%.

 April Fools			 March 15, 2017/0 Comments/in Fun Facts /by Bihua ChenApril 1st one of the most well-known and popular days on the calendar. We all know the day as April Fool’s Day but it has been called All Fools’ Day as well. It is this day that everyone questions what they are told and constantly checked behind, in front and even to their sides for tricksters because let’s face it getting someone in an April Fools’ joke is fun and thrilling, except for the victim of course.
Some pranks can be harmless and fun for example taking Oreo cookies and scrapping the icing out just to replace it with toothpaste before serving to your friend. Now, that is hilarious, and what makes it better is the face you have to witness as they take that bite expecting a sugary sweet filling only to be met with a minty fresh toothpaste.
This fun filled trickery laden day has been popular since the 19th century but even though it’s a widely celebrated day no country has claimed this day as an actual holiday. If you have ever read The Canterbury Tales written by Geoffrey Chaucer back in 1392 you would see that was the first recorded association between the day April 1 and foolishness. It’s crazy to think this day filled with jokes and trickery can be followed so far back in history. Here’s yet another fun fact for your arsenal of fun facts…April Fools’ Day was celebrated as a Roman festival known as Hilaria…can you spot the similarity? Hilaria….hilarious…jokes…pranks…Get it?
Depending on your location in the world you might celebrate this day differently, take a look at the UK for example. They celebrate the day only until midday. If the prankster is playing a joke after midday in the UK they actually become the April fool themselves and you could say the joke is on them, so if you are in the UK best get up early and start your pranking so you can be finished by midday.
Most of the places who take part in the debauchery that is April Fool’s pranks use the phrase “April Fool!” to show their victim has been pranked on this day. Ireland’s traditional April Fool’s Day consists of a person entrusted to deliver an “important letter” to someone. Once the letter is delivered and the recipient reads it they find out they should “send the fool further,” this would lead to another letter being sent to someone else and would continue until the victim realized what was going on or was informed of the prank.
The media are even taking part in this prank day, by publishing at least one article on this day that is fake. They will reveal the prank either in tiny print at the bottom of the article or wait to reveal the truth the next day.
It’s hard to get away from pranks on April Fool’s Day unless you stay in your home, keeping your doors locked and phone turned off. But why fight it, get out and have fun with it some cultures makes a game of it to see who can create the best prank. Life’s too short to be serious all the time so get out there on April 1st and have some fun.

Bihua Chen2017-03-15 18:37:052017-03-10 18:39:44April Fools How to Prep Your Garden for Spring			 March 12, 2017/0 Comments/in Springtime /by Bihua ChenWhat comes to your mind when you hear of spring? Yes, you are right! The very first thing that comes to our mind is flowers, vegetables, fruits, and aromas etc. The arrival of springtime is evident in a garden when a most vigorous and colorful appearance is seen. One truth is that preparing your garden for spring can be a wonderful weekly activity, from planting until they bloom, as well as being a pleasant way to welcome the spring without spending a fortune. This activity is not only loved by the ones who are garden lovers but it takes a heck lot of interest for those too, who plant seeds and wait for them to emerge out. In addition, the children love this activity the most.  “There is a series of simple activities that can be used to prepare your garden for spring,” says Bihua Chen, a gardening devotee.
Measures to prep your garden for spring:
Deep cleaning of the garden is very essential, though it is a delicate task in which it is necessary first to free the plants from the dry leaves, and the damaged parts that hinder the natural growth to make them look beautiful. The hedges and shrubs also need pruning in which old, broken or damaged wood and wilted flowers should be removed. As for the grass, the main care is required. Make sure to leave the grass very short so that it grows stronger and homogeneously. Also, it is very important to fertilize the lawn so that it has the necessary nutrients and irrigate it with greater intensity so that it stays healthy.
However, apart from this, the following are the things that need to be taken care of. These points are mentioned by Bihua Chen. Follow these steps and prepare your garden for spring and that too for sure!

Plant seeds:

It is best to plant the seeds as soon as the spring arrives. Use the seeds of past season, be it of flowers and vegetables that grew in the garden. Make sure that the seeds are dry. As soon as the spring draws near, plant the seeds in seedbeds and keep them under the sunlight. However, you can also buy good quality seeds from the market.

Plant the cuttings:

Ask for the cuttings from a friend, or a neighbor, plant these cutting too. Botanic gardens almost and always prune on roses and other plants in the middle of winter or early spring.

Wait until the frost season is over:

Once the probability of frost is zero, take the seedlings out and continue to water them. Do it for one or two weeks so that they can adapt from the internal to the external environment. Make sure you water the plants in time.
Also, take care of the plants that are weak so that they sustain. When you are done with all this, it means this is the time when your garden is in reality prepared, with all the blooming colors of flowers, with the vegetables and fruits grown at your own end, in your own garden. Happy gardening!

Bihua Chen2017-03-12 18:33:112017-03-10 18:37:00How to Prep Your Garden for Spring Whats Upcoming For Apple			 March 10, 2017/5 Comments/in Fun Facts, Tech News /by Bihua ChenApple a company which was originally an idea that one man had, Steve Jobs has been one of the most talked about and admired men for years, probably since he created the corporation known as Apple. The company produces everything from phones, tablets, computers, and software and brought in more than 230 billion dollars in 2015 alone. The company keeps coming out with bigger and better products and ideas so it’s no shock to see what they are coming up with for the current 2017 year.
Each year the company teeters on the edge of new technology and each year they shock consumers with the amazing things put out this year should be no different. Thanks to the launch of the large screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014 Apple has become the most profitable company in the world!
So, without further adieu let’s take a look at some of the rumors going around about what Apple is going to be coming out with this year, in 2017.

First, Apple is radically redesigning their iPhones, if you thought the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was awesome just wait til you see what’s coming out this year! It’s been said that Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be water resistant and sport much better quality cameras. Consumers were thrilled when the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus came out with all their perks and features but this new design will leave consumers speechless.
Apple is also redesigning some of their more popular pieces of electronics such as their Apple Watch and iPads. The new designs will offer more features and smaller sizes. For those of you are tech savvy and want the newest gadgets, Apple is said be releasing their new technology…Apple Glasses. These smart glasses would connect wirelessly to your iPhone and would display images for the wearer to see right there in their glasses. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, right?
How would you react if your iPhone or iPad didn’t have the signature home buttons? You would have a larger screen face compared to older models of the products.
Control your home while away from home, how nice would that be. Apple is said to be releasing a Smart Home Tech that would allow users to control things at home like smart locks and lights right from their iPhone or Apple Watch. This could be highly beneficial to those on vacation, say goodbye to old fashioned timers and hello to remote controls.

It’s no shock that Apple has an almost endless list of upgrades, add ons and new products they are considering for release this year, after all they didn’t become the biggest technology company in the world by sitting on the side lines and playing it safe. Keep your eyes open for all the new and wonderful releases that will be coming from the Apple Company here in 2017.

Bihua Chen2017-03-10 18:31:402017-03-10 18:32:57Whats Upcoming For Apple Oddities for March			 March 10, 2017/1 Comment/in Fun Facts, Springtime /by Bihua ChenMarch, a month that emphasizes, meteorologically speaking is very variable. The third month of the year stands out for leaving the winter behind and starting the spring. In addition, we will also have to change the time, so we can take advantage of more hours of light during the afternoon. So are you looking forward to what happens in March, follow us and we tell you in detail everything you should know about the month of March?

Unpredictable weather in March:

March is usually a very changing month, with very rainy and cold days and other sunny and spring days. As for temperatures, the average maximums exceed 15 degrees in most of the regions.

World Meteorological Day:

Since 1961 the World Meteorological Day commemorates the entry into force, on March 23, 1950, of the Convention Establishing the World Meteorological Organization. Every March 23 is used to warn about the effects of pollution on the climate.

March, a windy month:

The month of March is one of the windiest, especially in the northern half.

Early spring:

Bihua Chen mentions that on March 20, the spring will officially begin, so it is the best time for planting seeds. Also, he mentioned that it will last until the 20 of June which is the beginning of the summer. This means that the spring is on the move.

Daylight saving time changes:

On March 27 at 2:00 in the morning, the clock will be changed at 3:00 in the morning. This way, we will have more hours of light in the afternoons, whereas in the morning it will dawn later. The time change occurs twice a year and its goal is to save energy. In addition, one fact is that on the first day of spring, sunrise and sunset occur 12 hours apart.

March, a month of tomatoes, strawberries, chard, sole or suckling pig:

Being a transition month between winter and spring, we have seasonal fruits and vegetables like chard, tomatoes, strawberries, artichokes or green beans. The fish and shellfish are at their best are the scampi and sole, while meat, suckling pig or rabbit are highly desirable.

First flowers that arrive in March:

Indeed the month of March refers to colorful flowers and honey bees roaming over them, but there are certain flowers like daffodils, lilies, tulips, irises, and lilacs that appear in spring primarily, depicts Bihua Chen, a garden enthusiastic.

Spring fever:

Are you going through it? If yes then this means that the spring fever is not just an expression. The experts say that our body feels changes due to the difference in temperature, hormones, and diet.

The growth of boys:

You may probably not know about this fact that the boys grow more in spring than at other times of the year. This happens because, during the spring, children tend to spend more time outdoors, doing physical activity and exposed to more sunlight, which helps to accelerate the growth process.

Baby animals are born:

Surprising yet a truth, that many animals give birth like cows, birds, and ducks. This is because animals need to have their offspring when the weather allows them access to more food and warmer temperatures.

 Career History



Managing Member & Chief Executive Officer

                                    2013 - Current                


Cormorant Asset Management LLC


                  Cormorant Asset Management manages a hedge fund and a private equity fund that focus on investments in the healthcare sector. The firm employs a fundamental, research intensive approach that focuses on primary research to identify investment opportunities.The objective of the hedge fund is to generate superior risk-adjusted returns with low market correlation. Cormorant seeks to accomplish this objective primarily through a combination of long investment positions and short selling to achieve capital appreciation while attempting to preserve capital and mitigate risk through hedging activities. The firm invests substantially, but not solely, in publicly traded equity securities in the healthcare and life science industries.The private equity fund’s investment objective is to generate significant long-term capital appreciation by creating or investing in market innovative companies in the biotechnology and life sciences marketplace. Cormorant expects to achieve this objective by primarily investing in “crossover” (or mezzanine) round or pre-IPO portfolio companies in the biotech, medical device, diagnostics, generics, pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and life science research tool sectors.

North Tide Capital LLC


                  North Tide Capital's objective in managing the North Tide Funds is to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns without consideration to generating current income. The funds seek to meet this objective by investing substantially, but not solely, in the publicly-traded common stock of companies in the healthcare industry. North Tide performs in-depth analysis to determine a fair intrinsic value for various stocks within the healthcare universe, and as market prices fluctuate around thatintrinsic value, they look for opportunities to profit.North Tide employs a rigorous investment process that relies on primary research and detailed financial modeling to develop and test differentiated, contrarian views that focus on a longer-term investment horizon. The firm believes that this approach provide the funds opportunities to capitalize on both the inherent investment opportunities in the healthcare sector, as well as opportunistically profit from short-term market dislocations.North Tide invests in healthcare companies with market-cap greater than $1 billion, which they believe are subject to significant market and knowledge inefficiencies and are generally relatively liquid investment opportunities. They also invest in companies with market-cap less than $1 billion. North Tide believes companies with lower market-caps, though less liquid, generally have fewer analysts and investors following them, which often results in greater market and knowledge inefficiencies, allowing for a more favorable risk-return than larger companies.As part of their strategy and to maximize returns, the funds may employ leverage as deemed prudent by North Tide. The funds generally employ leverage in an amount equal to approximately 200% of their assets, however they may employ greater amounts of leverage in the sole discretion of North Tide or if opportunities or market conditions present favorable opportunities. If North Tide is unable to identify favorable investments with an asymmetric risk-reward, they may significantly reduce the use of leverage, or employ no leverage at all. North Tide may also employ an investment strategy with a fairly concentrated portfolio, provided, any single position doesn't represent more than 20% of a fund’s exposure at any time, with the exception of ETFs, synthetic “basket” short positions, or other hedging instruments, which may exceed such amount.^
