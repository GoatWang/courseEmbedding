“Wonderful! ”


Reviewed May 19, 2017



via mobile




I've been an owner for several years. Great company that offers a great product. Properties are beautiful and the staff are great. So far, I've visited the properties in So Lake Tahoe, Napa, San Luis Obispo, Steamboat, Las Vegas, Sedona, and exchanged a stay in Palm Desert and Hawaii. It's a different way to make reservations. If you're ready to make a long-term commitment to vacationing then it's the nicer way to go. Just like any other timeshare or vacation ownership, they offer free gifts to get people to come in and sit with an agent. If you're not ready then don't accept the free gift. If you accept the free gift then don't be surprised if they ask you to buy. I've met with a number of agents. Some are good and some are not so good. Overall, I've had a good experience.




Stayed May 2017, traveled with family

“Big, Big Mistake”


Reviewed May 8, 2017



via mobile




We have been in timeshare for over 30 years, had "weeks" in 5 places, never had a problem, have traded weeks successfully and enjoyed many vacations. Our weeks at Powhatan Plantation in Williamsburg, VA, were bought out by Diamond Resorts. Two years ago we were convinced by DR representatives that we should convert to points. Although we were reluctant we were persuaded.... it was the more modern way, gave more options, etc. We compared it to moving from a land line to a smart phone. All I can say is this... we have paid over $18,000 in two years to DR and have 15,000 unused points to show for it. The times we tried to use points we got nowhere. We thought our Powhatan weeks were now points. Oh no! They are still weeks, but we can convert them to points for a fee. Biggest, biggest mistake of OUR lives. We should have stayed with what we had because it had always worked. We know points works for some people, but we have paid a LOT of money for something that is not working for us. Think twice!!

“timeshare presentation experience”


Reviewed February 2, 2017




We were recruited for the timeshare presentation while walking through the Stratosphere. They gave a great pitch and offered us comped meal, gambling money, show tix, etc. We had to show our IDs and credit card, and we were taken on a shuttle to Polo Suites for the presentation. My husband and I did our research on their strategies on our way there, so we were prepared to turn down their offer. From the start there were snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. We had our own vacation consultant that we met with initially, and then we went through an energetic presentation for the group. At the end, we met with our consultant again for a tour of the place. Of the areas we did see, it looked nice. Think critically and do your research before you go so that you don't get sucked in. We were offered several different deals by several different people, but finally we got our gifts. We considered the whole presentation experience to be a fun adventure, but your mileage may vary. We were also given a "free vacation" to be used 6 months in the future, but there was so much fine print that I doubt we'll be using it.

“Terrible!!!!!!”


Reviewed December 5, 2016



via mobile




So far we are not impressed. If I could give zero stars I would. We had a three night voucher and was booked for the Stratosphere. It stated we were going to be in a well appointed room. I made reservations for 2 additional nights with a strip view. When I checked in I asked if it would be possible to stay in the same room for the entire stay. They said the room through Diamond resorts was a standard room with a limited view and I would need to pay the upgrade charge of $15 a night. With some deliberation we went ahead and upgraded to the strip view and paid the $45. Already a little irritated we went to our room. Once we arrived I was absolutely disgusted!!!!!!! Nothing about our room said well appointed. No fridge, no coffee maker, the room was tiny. We were tripping over each other just to walk around the room. The channel line up was pathetic. No fan in the bathroom. And the beds were terrible. At 5'9" my feet hung off the end and I woke up with a backache after tossing and turning all night. On future visits we will definitely not be staying at the stratosphere. And at the presentation that we are required to attend on Tuesday morning they are going to get a mouthful of how pathetic their sales pitch is so far.

“we wanted free show and dinner tickets in vegas”


Reviewed November 21, 2016




Worst experience of my life. We were approached in the Stratosphere. We agreed to see their property and here the pitch. It was only supposed to last 1 1/2 hrs. We got there at 830 and we were there until 100. They tried showing us pictures of there dead family members. They wouldn't take no for an answer. The property did not look nice to me. They said it was no pressure but I walked out wanting to cry. After we get through saying no to one agent. We have to go through the process again and again. We went through four different agents. All I wanted was facts so I could make up my mind. They never gave me any facts. The last offer was tempting 29 a month and test it out and if you don't like it you could get your money back or use it as a deposit and upgrade later if you like it. We passed because I didn't feel comfortable with the pressure. I was about to have a panic attack. After reading an article online about the program when I got home, I was so relieved that I didn't say yes. Apparently they are being sued because they don't like giving people their money back when not happy. That and they didn't mention how hard it is to get out of the program. Four different agents. Sadly we didn't even use the dinner and show tickets because the presentation upset us that much. I will never have anything to do with diamond resorts.

“0% chance of staying with DRI”


Reviewed November 9, 2016




Here's the story. Traveled to kauai in 2015 for vacation. Booked a tour, apparently through DRI. Tour was fine...until they told my the tour came with a free vacation. Since that time, I have received no less that hundreds of calls from the robo number, 866.877.3868. On my landline, on my cell phone, on my wife's cell phone, trying to get us to book our "free" vacation. Despite numerous pleas for them to stop calling, it is incessant. I work from home, and 3x per day, the phones will ring. I cannot travel for health reasons. I have told no less than a few dozen reps that info. If I ever do get to travel again, I can assure you, it will not be to any destination that has anyting to do with Diamond Resorts Intl. 0% chance.

“Beware of the sales hype and freebies to view the property”


Reviewed May 22, 2017




Went to Richmond VA and was conned into paying $149 to get a free stay in Las Vegas to consider purchasing a time share. They put us up in a dump for our free stay. The $100 Restaurant card turned out to be a card for coupons to only one restaurant in LasVegas and none in my area. I can do better on Groupon. The $50 bank gift card never worked from day one. If this is how they treat prospective customers, I'm surprised that even the high pressure sales people who keep you at the presentation well over the aloted time make any sales. I felt conned. Very untrustworthy organization. We travel a lot and will never stay in any place associated with this company

“Wonderful! ”


Reviewed May 19, 2017



via mobile




I've been an owner for several years. Great company that offers a great product. Properties are beautiful and the staff are great. So far, I've visited the properties in So Lake Tahoe, Napa, San Luis Obispo, Steamboat, Las Vegas, Sedona, and exchanged a stay in Palm Desert and Hawaii. It's a different way to make reservations. If you're ready to make a long-term commitment to vacationing then it's the nicer way to go. Just like any other timeshare or vacation ownership, they offer free gifts to get people to come in and sit with an agent. If you're not ready then don't accept the free gift. If you accept the free gift then don't be surprised if they ask you to buy. I've met with a number of agents. Some are good and some are not so good. Overall, I've had a good experience.

“Big mistake”


Reviewed June 8, 2017




As others have said BIG MISTAKE, we had a week in Virginia beach and were talked into points, which we now have 15000 but unless we want to go to Williamsburg Va or Orlando we go nowhere. We live in Virginia so Williamsburg is not a place we want to go all the time. And then once all was said and done we realize we still have to pay a fee on our week!!! Now we are stuck, trying to find a way out and not lose all. So sorry we had a weak moment

“Beware of the sales hype and freebies to view the property”


Reviewed May 22, 2017




Went to Richmond VA and was conned into paying $149 to get a free stay in Las Vegas to consider purchasing a time share. They put us up in a dump for our free stay. The $100 Restaurant card turned out to be a card for coupons to only one restaurant in LasVegas and none in my area. I can do better on Groupon. The $50 bank gift card never worked from day one. If this is how they treat prospective customers, I'm surprised that even the high pressure sales people who keep you at the presentation well over the aloted time make any sales. I felt conned. Very untrustworthy organization. We travel a lot and will never stay in any place associated with this company

“Wonderful! ”


Reviewed May 19, 2017



via mobile




I've been an owner for several years. Great company that offers a great product. Properties are beautiful and the staff are great. So far, I've visited the properties in So Lake Tahoe, Napa, San Luis Obispo, Steamboat, Las Vegas, Sedona, and exchanged a stay in Palm Desert and Hawaii. It's a different way to make reservations. If you're ready to make a long-term commitment to vacationing then it's the nicer way to go. Just like any other timeshare or vacation ownership, they offer free gifts to get people to come in and sit with an agent. If you're not ready then don't accept the free gift. If you accept the free gift then don't be surprised if they ask you to buy. I've met with a number of agents. Some are good and some are not so good. Overall, I've had a good experience.

“Big, Big Mistake”


Reviewed May 8, 2017



via mobile




We have been in timeshare for over 30 years, had "weeks" in 5 places, never had a problem, have traded weeks successfully and enjoyed many vacations. Our weeks at Powhatan Plantation in Williamsburg, VA, were bought out by Diamond Resorts. Two years ago we were convinced by DR representatives that we should convert to points. Although we were reluctant we were persuaded.... it was the more modern way, gave more options, etc. We compared it to moving from a land line to a smart phone. All I can say is this... we have paid over $18,000 in two years to DR and have 15,000 unused points to show for it. The times we tried to use points we got nowhere. We thought our Powhatan weeks were now points. Oh no! They are still weeks, but we can convert them to points for a fee. Biggest, biggest mistake of OUR lives. We should have stayed with what we had because it had always worked. We know points works for some people, but we have paid a LOT of money for something that is not working for us. Think twice!!

“timeshare presentation experience”


Reviewed February 2, 2017




We were recruited for the timeshare presentation while walking through the Stratosphere. They gave a great pitch and offered us comped meal, gambling money, show tix, etc. We had to show our IDs and credit card, and we were taken on a shuttle to Polo Suites for the presentation. My husband and I did our research on their strategies on our way there, so we were prepared to turn down their offer. From the start there were snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. We had our own vacation consultant that we met with initially, and then we went through an energetic presentation for the group. At the end, we met with our consultant again for a tour of the place. Of the areas we did see, it looked nice. Think critically and do your research before you go so that you don't get sucked in. We were offered several different deals by several different people, but finally we got our gifts. We considered the whole presentation experience to be a fun adventure, but your mileage may vary. We were also given a "free vacation" to be used 6 months in the future, but there was so much fine print that I doubt we'll be using it.

“Terrible!!!!!!”


Reviewed December 5, 2016



via mobile




So far we are not impressed. If I could give zero stars I would. We had a three night voucher and was booked for the Stratosphere. It stated we were going to be in a well appointed room. I made reservations for 2 additional nights with a strip view. When I checked in I asked if it would be possible to stay in the same room for the entire stay. They said the room through Diamond resorts was a standard room with a limited view and I would need to pay the upgrade charge of $15 a night. With some deliberation we went ahead and upgraded to the strip view and paid the $45. Already a little irritated we went to our room. Once we arrived I was absolutely disgusted!!!!!!! Nothing about our room said well appointed. No fridge, no coffee maker, the room was tiny. We were tripping over each other just to walk around the room. The channel line up was pathetic. No fan in the bathroom. And the beds were terrible. At 5'9" my feet hung off the end and I woke up with a backache after tossing and turning all night. On future visits we will definitely not be staying at the stratosphere. And at the presentation that we are required to attend on Tuesday morning they are going to get a mouthful of how pathetic their sales pitch is so far.

Vacant space is money lost to the association. We develop and implement resort rental programs and utilize wholesale contracts to optimize rental inventory and ensure expanded revenues, room utilization and cash flow. We will help you forecast six-month occupancy trends to assure rental inventory is available and sales are maximized. Our proprietary reporting mechanisms for owner occupancy, exchanges and delinquent weeks allow you to make optimum use of all available units for rent.
Reservation Services and Front Desk Support
You never have a second chance to make a first impression. That is why knowing your guests will be presented with a professional and welcoming experience is vitally important. We can provide you with a turnkey solution for all of your owner-contact operations from reservations–supported by our proprietary, state-of-the-art software, and a world-class customer service center–to fully trained, 24-hour front desk staffing, back-of-the-house accounting and night audit reconciliation services.
Risk Management
Provide your owners, guests, visitors and employees with optimum protection for your resort and association. Our expert staff assists with assessing property damage, negotiating insurance adjustments and providing assistance and planning in the reduction of insurance claims. We partner with your resort manager to handle guest claims, complaints and personal injury issues. Due to our global footprint, umbrella policies for property/casualty, general liability, workers compensation, auto, crime and board Duties and Obligations combine premium savings with peace-of-mind coverage.
Sales and Marketing
Generating millions of dollars annually through lead generation, advertising campaigns and customer contact mechanisms, our sales and marketing team provides owners with a resort tour and presentation about THE Club® at Diamond Resorts International®. These tour guests arrive from many lead sources and marketing efforts including rental and space management effort and return visits. The Diamond Resorts International® national customer care center serves as a central contact point for all potential customers, database management, and do-not-call oversight and owner referral reward campaigns.
Technology Services
Access to timely information is a powerful tool, whether you manage five or 500 rooms or serve a few hundred or thousands of owners, however building or obtaining the technology infrastructure to have this information at your fingertips is costly. Our comprehensive technology system includes proprietary software modules tailored for the unique needs of the vacation ownership industry and can be customized for your resort and ownership base. We have built a state-of-the-art data center that facilitates management reporting and business intelligence. Our team of hospitality technology professionals provides proven, tested solutions for a full range of your information needs.
THE Club® at 
Diamond Resorts International®
