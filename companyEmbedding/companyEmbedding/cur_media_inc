C�R Media Releases Initial Beta Version of Its C�R Music 
iPhone App  



Company incorporates new features and functionality as it 
continues to progress toward a 2015 product launch

GLASTONBURY, CT--(April 28, 2015) - C�R Media, Inc. (OTCQB:CURM) 
(OTCBB:CURM) announced today that it has released the initial Beta version 
of its C�R Music iPhone App for testing. C�R Music is the Company's next 
generation social music streaming application expected to launch later this year 
on mobile and web. 

C�R Media's initial release of its Beta version for iPhone is part of a three 
step Beta testing period for C�R Music, as the Company continues to progress 
toward a planned launch in the coming months. The new Beta version of the C�R 
Music iPhone App includes new social features and improvements to the user 
interface and user experience. During this Beta phase the Company will test the 
overall social experience of the App's new features and functionality 
incorporated during its three month Alpha testing period, as well as the speed 
and reliability of the entire platform. C�R Media’s web product is currently in 
Alpha and progressing towards Beta. C�R Media expects to roll out its Android 
App in Beta within the next 60 days. 

Tom Brophy, Founder and CEO of C�R Media, commented, "We are excited to move 
into the final testing phase of our C�R Music iPhone App as we are now one step 
closer toward our goal of a full scale launch in the coming months. We have 
incorporated a tremendous amount of feedback from our Alpha testers and focus 
groups into this Beta release, and we are confident this final testing and 
refinement phase will help place C�R Music on the forefront of the music 
streaming industry upon its anticipated launch later this year."

About C�R Media
C�R Media is creating a next generation social music experience through the 
planned launch of C�R Music, a social mobile and web streaming music application 
that is being designed to enable its users to go beyond the limitations of 
traditional music streaming services. Upon its release, C�R Music will unlock 
the true expressive nature of an individual's connection with their music by 
fostering personalization, sharing and creativity. With C�R Music it's not just 
about streaming, it's about what the music means to you and how you want to 
express that to the world. For more information please visit www.curmusic.com

(the "Company") (OTCBB:CURM) (OTCQB:CURM)  announced today that it has rolled out the alpha version of its CUR Music iPhone App and website for testing.  CUR Music is the Company's next generation social music streaming application and web streaming experience.  
CUR Media released its Alpha version for iPhone and web to over 100 individuals representing a cross section of its target demographic to test CUR Music's features, functionality and unique social components.  The Company has also conducted a series of focus groups to help determine necessary refinements as well as the future course of development as it progresses toward Beta and eventual product launch, anticipated to take place in mid-2015. CUR Media further anticipates an Alpha version of CUR Music for Android to be available for testing in the next several weeks as it continues to advance the entire CUR Music platform.
Tom Brophy, Founder and CEO of CUR Media, commented, "We are excited to analyze and act on the feedback from Alpha testers who are in our target demographic market.  We have done extensive research, planning and design work to develop a product that we believe bridges the gap between the desires of the consumer and the needs of the music industry.  The alpha testing effort is providing valuable insights which are being incorporated to further improve the CUR Music application and website experience while we advance towards a Beta release and make preparations for the full product launch expected later this year."

 INTRODUCING CÜR MUSIC  Start with a library of over 10 million tracks as a blend of internet radio and on-demand streaming. Add a super cool interface with a universe of sharing, curating and social tools built in. And you can try it for Free!  WHO WE ARE We threw 10 million songs in a tank with a giant octopus — and the result was CÜR Music. CÜR Music, a division of CÜR Media, Inc., is led by Tom Brophy, digital media entrepreneur. Other members of the CÜR Crew have spent time at RCA Records, Nokia, SiriusXM, NBA, Deutsche Bank, Harman Kardon, BET, and Sony — and now, we’ve banded together to create something new for you. CÜR plans to be the premiere social music app for today’s music & social media lover combining music streaming with a new level of social sharing. With CÜR, you can share songs with photos or personal video messages, curate your own streaming radio station, and customize your music experience! We're launching soon. Get ready!      http://www.curmusic.com/  - Home http://ir.curmusic.com/ - Investor Page http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CURM/profile - OTC Info    Company Profile CÜR Media, Inc. is developing a new streaming music experience that intersects Pandora and Spotify for listening on the web and mobile devices. Headquartered  in South Glastonbury, Connecticut, ?CÜR Media, Inc. is the parent company of CÜR, a social music streaming app geared for today’s listener. Scheduled to launch in the Fall of 2015, CÜR is led by Tom Brophy, a successful digital media entrepreneur, Bob Jamieson (former Chairman/CEO of RCA Records) and Sanjan Dhody (Managing Director and Client Advisor at Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, Inc.?). CÜR Music began testing in early 2012 as Raditaz, a DMCA compliant Internet radio product, and has developed iPhone and Android applications that in beta had over 150,000 monthly unique users. The Company plans to launch its enhanced product offering later this year with a multi-million dollar marketing campaign. The market for streaming music access is massive. The $6.7B US recorded music market is shifting from CDs and downloads to streaming music (access models). 275 million people over the age of 6 still listen to the radio and spend 15 hours per week listening, and more than 120 million people use some form of Internet radio in the US every month.
