VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS (SM)
 A DIVISION OF VAN KAMPEN FUNDS INC.
 INSURED INCOME TRUST, SERIES 92

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 invests in a  
portfolio of long-term bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7.

                                       -------------            ------------
    Estimated Current Return:           6.03%                    6.07%
    Estimated Long Term Return:         6.01%                    6.05%
       CUSIP:                           92114K-50-1 92114K-51-9

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.   

 PROSPECTUS PART I
 MAY 1, 2002

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.

 YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of
the Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus.     

Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per unit when you redeem them or when your trust terminates.    

(2)  After the first settlement date (May 6, 2002), you will pay accrued        
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(3)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance       
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.  

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
   Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) During the first year the Trustee
    will reduce its fee by approximately $.19 per Unit (which is the estimated
   interest to be earned prior to the expected delivery dates for the "when,
    as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed
  this amount, the Trustee will reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After
the first year, the Trustee's fee will be the amount indicated above. 
    Estimated interest income will increase to $62.62. Estimated expenses will
    increase to $2.32 and $1.92 under the monthly and semi-annual distribution

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from January 23, 2002
to April 30, 2002.                                                      

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

         COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
       SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
      ---------------      ---------------
$    8,832,176        $     77,778

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate   
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the   
   corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked
  by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and
if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins  
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of     
delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the 
first settlement date.                                                  

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an   
  original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part
II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is     
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

UNDERWRITING. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the
following amounts from the Sponsor. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" in Prospectus Part II.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7):                                           

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7) as of May 1, 2002. The statement of        
condition and portfolio are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on such financial statements based on   
our audit.                                                                      

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase bonds by correspondence with the Trustee. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement      
presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios    
Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series 7) as of May 1, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, J.J. Kenny & Co., Inc., as Evaluator, Van Kampen Investment Advisory   
Corp., as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.                     

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to   
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the    
aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of     
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash     
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial          
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to   
the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that 
holds primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I,
is referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily      
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are     
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust         
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the     
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by    
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.                    

OBJECTIVE AND BOND SELECTION. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally     
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an 
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by     
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of        
intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will    
achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with   
greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.        

 In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was 
not less than "BBB-", or the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating 
of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional or conditional     
ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit characteristics  
sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing bonds    
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of         
comparable quality and maturity, (c) the diversification of bonds as to purpose 
of issue and location of issuer and (d) with respect to the Insured Trusts, the 
availability and cost of insurance. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease 
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the   
Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but  
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct 
the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during 
the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

   Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".                            

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancellable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

RISK FACTORS. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if   
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                        

    Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  

  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become  
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or 
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

   MORE ABOUT THE BONDS. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

    Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

   Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds
do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are   
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

     NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

   In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The minimum purchase in the primary and   
secondary market is one Unit. In connection with fully disclosed transactions   
with the Sponsor, the minimum purchase is the number of Units stated in the     
contract between the Sponsor and the related broker or agent.                   

The sales charge applicable to quantity purchases during the initial  
offering period is reduced as follows:

cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

     The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life of your Trust's portfolio:

   For purposes of computation of the estimated long-term return life, bonds
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the bonds
have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call 
date, in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date; or   
(b) the bonds are subject to a "mandatory tender", in which case the mandatory  
tender will be deemed to be the maturity date. The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   
Expressed as a percent of the Public Offering Price, the sales charge on a Trust
consisting entirely of bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 4.80%.          

    Any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling Underwriter,
broker, dealer or agent. The Sponsor will, however, increase the concession or  
agency commission for quantity purchases.                                       

The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases, during the initial   
offering period table above will apply on all purchases by the same person from 
any one Underwriter or dealer of units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
which are being offered in the initial offering period (a) on any one day (the  
"Initial Purchase Date") or (b) on any day subsequent to the Initial Purchase   
Date, if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust purchased on the    
Initial Purchase Date. In the event units of more than one trust are purchased  
on the Initial Purchase Date, the aggregate dollar amount of such purchases will
be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a reduced sales charge.
Such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public offering price per   
unit (on the day preceding the date of purchase) of each respective trust       
purchased to determine the total number of units which such amount could have   
purchased of each individual trust. Purchasers must then consult the applicable 
trust's prospectus to determine whether the total number of units which could   
have been purchased of a specific trust would have qualified for a reduced sales
charge and, if so qualified, the amount of such reduction. Assuming a purchaser 
qualifies for a sales charge reduction or reductions, to determine the          
applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it is necessary to accumulate   
all purchases made on the Initial Purchase Date and all purchases made in       
accordance with (b) above. Units purchased in the name of the spouse of a       
purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser ("immediate family        
members") will be deemed for the purposes of calculating the applicable sales   
charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges   
will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for one
or more trust, estate or fiduciary accounts. If you purchased Units on more than
one day to achieve the discounts described in this paragraph, the discount      
allowed on any single day will apply only to Units purchased on that day (a     
retroactive discount is not given on all prior purchases).                      

     For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases
in the table above, purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a    
specified amount of Units of any Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series unit investment trust   
during the initial offering period by executing and delivering a letter of      
intent to the Sponsor, which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to   
the Sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months, will be       
eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the tables above based  
on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of     
intent. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees that the first  
purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at   
least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in   
the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the establishment of the    
letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units representing 5% of the total 
amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the Trustee pending  
completion of these purchases. All distributions on Units held in escrow will be
credited to the Unitholder's account. If total purchases prior to the expiration
of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a        
Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in escrow will be transferred to  
the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who purchases Units during the letter of 
intent period in excess of the number of Units specified in a Unitholder's      
letter of intent, the amount of which would cause the Unitholder to be eligible 
to receive an additional sales charge reduction, will be allowed such additional
sales charge reduction on the purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to  
reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of Units during 
the letter of intent period. If the total purchases are less than the amount    
specified, the Unitholder involved must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the  
difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which   
would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder
will, however, be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching
any lower breakpoint level. If the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount
within 20 days after written request by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's         
securities representative, the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to redeem an   
appropriate number of the escrowed Units to meet the required payment. By       
establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder irrevocably appoints the Sponsor  
as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the Unitholder's       
escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in the premises. A Unitholder or
his securities representative must notify the Sponsor whenever the Unitholder   
makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended     
amount.                                                                         

During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any Van 
Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit     
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust at a reduced sales charge. The reduced     
sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public 
Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and will be equal to the lesser of
$25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for an Intermediate Term     
Trust.                                                                          

Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children, 
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, 
sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for   
the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as "related        
purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and Underwriters and  
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the       
applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer concession in  
the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors    
(including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates and vendors      
providing services to the Sponsor may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable dealer concession.                                    

    Purchasers of units of any two consecutive series of a Trust may aggregate
purchases of units of such series for purposes of the sales charge reduction for
quantity purchases, provided that at the time of the initial purchase of units  
such purchaser submitted a purchase order for at least 100 units that was       
partially unfulfilled due to a lack of units of such Trust series available for 
sale at such time. The sales charge reduction shall be applied to the subsequent
purchase of units such that the aggregate sales charge reduction applicable to  
both purchases will equal the amount described in the initial offering period   
sales charge table above.                                                       

   A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of  
the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section   
called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases. Units may  
be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering Price    
(for purchases which do not qualify for a sales charge reduction for quantity   
purchases) less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and      
dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units through registered    
investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers 
who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial  
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such     
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments        
investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment     
authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar        
capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director
or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors or their 
immediate family members (as described above) and (4) officers and directors of 
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through            
subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in    
this prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm employees and bank
holding company officers and directors who purchase Units through this program  
will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases.                

OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the 
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of 
Units on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales      
charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the 
number of Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of  
an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial        
offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on
days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public
Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering Price will be         
effective for all orders received at or prior to the Evaluation Time on each    
such day. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock   
Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by  
the Trustee, Sponsor or any Underwriter for purchases, sales or redemptions     
after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be
held until the next determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the   
applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of  
Units outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made 
by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is    
tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be    
expected to average approximately 0.35-1% more than the bid price.              

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices
or offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

    A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

     ACCRUED INTEREST. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
shown in the following tables.

 Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an
aggregate of 250 or more Units directly from the Sponsor during the initial     
offering period will receive a net concession equal to the net concession       
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. For individual transactions of less than 250 Units, the Sponsor will     
offer a rebate per Unit equal to the Volume Concession Rebate described in the  
tables above so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate
net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the 
end of the initial offering period.                                             

    Included in the concessions and agency commissions described in the tables
are volume concessions or agency commissions of an additional $5.00 per Unit for
any broker/dealer or agent (other than Underwriters) who purchases from the     
Sponsor at least 250 Units of a Trust during the initial offering period. These 
additional concessions will be allowed at the time of purchase, provided,       
however, the additional concession applicable to initial purchases totaling less
than 250 Units will be paid retroactively at the end of the initial offering    
period. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a  
dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be   
applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The breakpoints
will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued.                                                                

 For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other
unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to      
purchase Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a        
Long-Term Trust and $17.50 per Unit for an Intermediate Term Trust.             

In addition to the concession or agency commission and the volume     
concession rebate set forth in the tables above, all broker-dealers and other   
selling firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a 
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.                                                               

   Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers
on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the   
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the concession or agency commission   
will amount to 70% of the applicable sales charge. The Sponsor reserves the     
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to
change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others  
from time to time.                                                              

SPONSOR AND UNDERWRITER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will sell Units to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten for Intermediate-Term Trusts and $35 per
Unit underwritten for Long-Term Trusts. The net concession earned by            
Underwriters after giving effect to sales charge discounts will equal the       
amounts shown in the tables below. For a list of the Underwriters that have     
purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession. The amounts of these rebates are shown in the table     
above. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for a Trust, the 
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on 
all Units of a Trust distributed during the initial offering period and         
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions   
described under "Unit Distribution."                                            

Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in a Trust will  
receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each Unit it      
underwrites. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar     
basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied  
on whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

    In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

Underwriters and broker-dealers, banks and/or others are eligible to  
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under    
which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards
for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such  
firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units.
Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of the 
assets of any Trust. These programs will not change the price Unitholders pay   
for their Units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the Units sold.  
Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business seminar which  
is open to Underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors. The Sponsor pays 
substantially all costs associated with the seminar, excluding Underwriter      
travel costs. Each Underwriter is invited to send a certain number of           
representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during 
a designated time period.                                                       

    MARKET FOR UNITS. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Units may be available for purchase in connection with "wrap fee" accounts
and other similar accounts. You should consult your financial professional to   
determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these purchases you  
generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is retained by your     
Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult the "Public
Offering--General" section for specific information on this and other sales     
charge discounts.                                                               

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

  Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

  Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

   REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc. at 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.                                                                     

After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust       
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option 
(PRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution        
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time.                                                                           

REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units
by tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay    
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public 
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on          
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

    The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

 EXCHANGE OPTION. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

UNITS. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a    
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by independent certified public accountants and the report of  
the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a         
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

    The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Because the bonds are insured by Portfolio Insurers or Preinsured Bond
Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest, when due, and on   
the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's has
assigned to the Units of an Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This     
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of       
Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such period. See      
"Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. This rating should not  
be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or
as a guarantee of the market value of an Insured Trust or of the Units.         

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of  
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The Sponsor is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect  
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor has its 
principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181-5555. As
of November 30, 2001, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.   
was $163,449,658 (unaudited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted 
a code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,      
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement  
contains additional information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot      
perform our duties under the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may
appoint a new sponsor, continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or     
terminate your Trust and distribute the liquidation proceeds.                   

 TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust  
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone     
(800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio, 
please contact the Trustee at its unit investment trust division offices or your
financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account       
information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by  
the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal      
Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional        
information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement,   
including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the   
effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and
replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                              

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

REPLACEMENT BONDS. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

 AMENDMENT OF TRUST AGREEMENT. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax      
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign
taxes. As with any investment, you should consult your own tax professional     
about your particular consequences. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service   
issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective January 1, 2001.     
Foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax       
consequences of these regulations.                                              

     ASSETS OF A TRUST. Each Trust will hold various debt obligations (the "Debt
Obligations"). All of the assets held by a Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." 
For purposes of this federal tax discussion, it is assumed that the Debt        
Obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income 
for federal income tax purposes.                                                

     TRUST STATUS. A Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata   
portion of the assets of your trust, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount, and capital gains, if any) from the Trust Assets when such income     
would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Trust       
Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically 
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from the Trust Assets 
which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced 
by amounts used to pay Trust expenses (including the deferred sales charge, if  
any).                                                                           

    YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis 
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, generally including 
sales charges, among each Trust Asset ratably according to their value on the   
date you purchase your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units (for example, in the case of
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

 If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax 
brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for 
long-term gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000, with a     
holding period of more than five years.                                         

 Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period of your Units. The tax     
rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are      
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however,  
treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.          

DISCOUNT, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PREMIUM ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS. Some Debt 
Obligations may have been sold with original issue discount. This generally     
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their   
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and       
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your   
basis of each Debt Obligation which was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.                                

 Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated          
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of 
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price a Trust pays  
for a Debt Obligation or on the price you pay for your Units. Market discount is
taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your Trust        
receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt Obligation is 
disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units. Alternatively,  
you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.       
Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis  
and the timing of certain interest expense deductions. "Stripped" U.S. Treasury 
obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules, rather than being 
treated as having market discount.                                              

     Alternatively, some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your
Trust at a premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any 
Debt Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable  
at maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize       
premium. If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received
on the Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your  
tax basis will be reduced.                                                      

    If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt Obligation.
When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of
capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.                       

 This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued with
original issue discount.                                                        

  EXCHANGES. If you elect to reinvest amounts received from a Trust into a
future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any  
gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be treated
as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange  
of your Units of your Trust for units of a future trust will generally be       
disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to
the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash    
sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.                                   

    LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust to the same    
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may, however, be required to    
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.               

 FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. Some distributions by your Trust may be
subject to foreign withholding taxes. Any interest withheld will nevertheless be
treated as income to you. However, because you are deemed to have paid directly 
your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your Trust, you   
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for U.S. tax purposes with 
respect to such taxes.                                                          

    If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen
or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you will not  
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of
the income from your Trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your Units,
provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor   
with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax 
purposes.                                                                       

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trusts for New York tax matters,
the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the   
Trusts will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the existing      
income tax laws of the State and City of New York.                              

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     SPONSOR, SUPERVISOR, EVALUATOR AND TRUSTEE. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

INSURANCE. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an 
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

RISK FACTORS

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

 TAXABLE MUNICIPAL ISSUES. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

  Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

     Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

     Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease 
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from 
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

     Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or   
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

    Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

  Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

   Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

    Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

    Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

     Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

     Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

     Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

   Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

    Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

  Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

ZERO COUPON BONDS. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon" 
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancellable and will continue in force so  
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force so long  
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in    
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of     
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the   
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the
payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the    
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy     
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with  
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of 
a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from  
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee     
would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such        
exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less
the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent        
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold
on an uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible  
for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each 
bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any  
change in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                    

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an    
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancellable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in 
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier than the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of    
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of securities      
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial guaranty insurance provides a
guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the 
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a premium to 
the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries principally insure         
asset-backed, collateralized and municipal securities. Asset-backed securities  
are generally supported by residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade        
receivables, securites or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or     
market value. Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage   
bonds and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist largely 
of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other special obligations
of state and local governments. Financial Security insures both newly issued    
securities sold in the primary market and outstanding securities sold in the    
secondary market that satisfy Financial Security's underwriting criteria.

Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed compay.  
Major shareholders of Holdings include XL Capital Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. On March 14, 2000, Holdings announced that it had       
entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Holdings would become a       
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dexia S.A., a publicly held Belgian corporation,

other closing conditions. Dexia S.A., through its bank subsidiaries, is         
primarily engaged in the business of public finance in France, Belgium and other
European countries. No shareholder of Holdings is obligated to pay any debt of

Security or to make any additional contribution to the capital of Financial     
Security. As of September 30, 2001, the total policyholders' surplus and        
contingency reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of

statutory accounting principles, approximately $1,526,197,000 (unaudited) and   
$784,712,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned   
premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated       
subsidiaries were, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty  
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security or its  
domestic or Bermuda operating insurance company subsidiaries are generally      
reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially       
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject to      
applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial Security reinsures
a portion of its liabilities under certain various quota share treaties and on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. This reinsurance is used by Financial Security
as a risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating     
agency requirements; it does not alter on limit the obligations of Financial    
Security under any financial guaranty insurance policy.                         

 Financial Security's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. Financial Security's insurer financial strength is rated
"AAA" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Standard &Poor's (Australia)    
Pty. Ltd. Financial Security's claims-paying ability is rated "AAA" by Fitch

Capital Guranty Insurance Company. On December 20, 1995, Capital Guaranty 
Corporation ("CGC") merged with a subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance

("FSA Maryland") and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Inc. On September 30, 1997, Financial Security Assurance Inc. assumed 
all of the liabilities of FSA Maryland and sold the FSA Maryland "shell company"
to American Capital Access, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Capital Access
Holdings, Incorporated.                                                         

General. Because the bonds in an Insured Trust are insured as to the timely
payment of principal and interest, when due (as more fully described above), and
on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's 
has assigned to the Units its "AAA" investment rating. Such rating will be in   
effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of Deposit and will, unless
renewed, terminate at the end of such period. The obtaining of this rating by an
Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the     
Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market value of the Insured 
Trust or of the Units.                                                          

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to  
obtain a higher yield on the Insured Trust portfolio than would be available if 
all the bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at   
the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest 
and principal, when due (as more fully described above), on the bonds. There is,
of course, no certainty that this result will be achieved.                      

    In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due (as more fully
described above), in respect of a bond, the appropriate Insurer shall make such 
payment within 30 days after it has been notified that such nonpayment has      
occurred. The appropriate Insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will     
succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof.                        

The information relating to the Insurers has been furnished by the      
respective Insurers. The financial information with respect to the Insurers     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units    
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of    
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                    

   The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

 If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio  
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

 TRUSTEE INFORMATION

of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust division offices
at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone (800) 221-7668. The  
Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent
of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal     
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                                     

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

    A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the      
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS

STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &  
Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the        
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This       
assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as     
guarantors, insurers or lessees.                                                

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

   I.   Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in
accordance with the terms of the obligation.                

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt bond
and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest.       

   AA--Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances they
differ from AAA issues only in small degree.                                    

A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,    
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          

BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay   
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection 
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit     
quality, the ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the addition of a    
plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being     
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or     
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion, 
makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of,  
such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.                                            

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. A brief description of the applicable 
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally       
stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements   
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. With the occasional    
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the safety of obligations  
of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money
market fluctuations.                                                            

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune  
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply 
in a few specific instances.                                                    

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market 
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances 
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions. During periods of   
normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa     
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific      
instances.                                                                      

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic  
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high 
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the      
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.                                                                       

  Con--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds      
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of projects
unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when facilities are 
completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition attaches.     
Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of         
construction or elimination of basis of condition.                              

 ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO UNITHOLDERS

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen American Capital Distributors, Inc.
and the Unitholders of Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 261:


We have audited the accompanying statements of condition (including the
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio of Insured Municipals Income
Trust, Series 261 as of October 31, 1995, and the related statements of
operations and changes in net assets for the three years ended October 31,
1995. These statements are the responsibility of the Trustee and the Sponsor.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on such statements based on our
audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our
procedures included confirmation of tax-exempt securities owned at October 31,
1995 by correspondence with the Trustee.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee and
the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Insured Municipals Income
Trust, Series 261 as of October 31, 1995, and the results of operations and
changes in net assets for the three years ended October 31, 1995, in

INSURED MUNICIPALS INCOME TRUST

SERIES 261





Notes to Financial Statements

October 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995



NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Security Valuation - Tax-exempt municipal securities are stated at the value
determined by the Evaluator, American Portfolio Evaluation Services (a
division of a subsidiary of the Sponsor). The Evaluator may determine the
value of the Bonds (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in Bonds comparable to
those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable Bonds,

(3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal or (4) by any
combination of the above. The Trust maintains insurance which provides for the
timely payment when due, of all principal and interest on Bonds owned by it.
Except in cases in which Bonds are in default, or significant risk of default,
this valuation does not include any value attributable to this insurance
feature since the insurance terminates as to any Bond at the time of its
disposition.


Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust was based on the determination
by Interactive Data Services, Inc. of the offering prices of the Bonds on the
date of deposit (January 23, 1991). Since the valuation is based upon the bid
prices the Trust recognized a downward adjustment of $130,924 on the date of
deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices.
This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized
appreciation reported in the financial statements for the period ended October
31, 1991.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of
being collected, (2) the Bonds in the Trust based on the value determined by
the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued expenses of the
Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax
purposes. Each Unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion
of the Trust and, accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income
taxes.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO



Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated N/R or * is
Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. Ratings marked *
are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. as these Bonds are not rated by
Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. N/R indicates that
the Bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill
Companies or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The ratings shown represent the
latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a brief description of rating
symbols and their related meanings, see "Description of Securities
Ratings" in Part Two.


Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each
issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that
year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F."
indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds.
"P.R." indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to
call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund
provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side
evaluation which represents a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds
were deposited in the Trust at a price higher than the price at which they are
redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the
original Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent that
the Bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price, this will
represent an increase in capital when compared with the original Public
Offering Price of the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the
amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to
redeemed Bonds and there will be distributed to Unitholders the principal
amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually and any premium received on such
redemption. However, should the amount available for distribution in the
Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special
distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding monthly
distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date. The
Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such redemptions.
For the Federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant
distributions, see paragraph (3) under "Federal Tax Status of the
Trusts" and "Annual Unit Income and Estimated Current Returns" in


Part Two.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)



Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on the Bonds in the Trust has been obtained by the
Trust or by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (as indicated in the Bond
name). Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the Bonds or the
value of the Units. For Bonds covered under the Trust's insurance policy the
insurance is effective only while Bonds thus insured are held in the Trust and
the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a monthly
basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various
insurance companies by the issuer of the Bond involved is payable by the
issuer. Insurance expense for the period reflects adjustments for redeemed or
sold Bonds.


An Accounting and Auditing Guide issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance
coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable value
in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or indication of the
probability of such default.  In the opinion of the Evaluator, there is no
indication of a probable default of Bonds in the portfolio as of the date of
these financial statements.

NOTE 3 - OTHER



Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of
the Bonds in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.


Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds per
Unit on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the
public offering price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering
price of the Bonds. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds per Unit on
the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to
average maturity of the Bonds in the portfolio. The sales charge ranges from
1.5% of the public offering price (1.523% of the aggregate bid price of the
Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average
maturity to 5.7% of the public offering price (6.045% of the aggregate bid
price of the Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with sixteen or more years to
average maturity.


Compensation of Evaluator - The Evaluator receives a fee for providing
portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to exceed the
aggregate cost of the Evaluator for providing such services to all applicable
Trusts). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases
under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer
Price Index.



NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS



During the years ended October 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995, 4 Units, 73 Units and
554 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

PROSPECTUS





Part Two



In the opinion of counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unitholders,
with certain exceptions, is excludable under existing law from gross income
for Federal income taxes, but may be subject to state and local taxes. Capital
gains, if any, are subject to Federal tax.


The Trust. The Trust consists of a series of National unit investment trusts
issued under the name Insured Municipals Income Trust (and including the
various series of the Discount Series, the Limited Maturity Series, the
Intermediate Series and the Short Intermediate Series) or under the name The
First National Dual Series Tax-Exempt Bond Trust. Each Trust consists of
interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of municipalities and
other governmental authorities or issued by certain United States territories
or possessions and their public authorities, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authority,
exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing law (the "Bonds"
or "Securities"). The objectives of the Trust are Federally tax-exempt
income and conservation of capital through an investment in a diversified,
insured portfolio of tax-exempt Bonds. The payment of interest and the
preservation of principal are, of course, dependent upon the continuing
ability of the issuers and/or obligors of the Bonds and of the insurers
thereof to meet their respective obligations. There is no assurance that the
Trust's objectives will be met. The Securities in the Discount Series were
acquired at prices which resulted in each Discount Series portfolio, as a
whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the aggregate par value of such
Securities. Gains based upon the difference, if any, between the value of the
Securities at maturity, redemption or sale and their purchase price at a
market discount (plus earned original issue discount) will constitute taxable
ordinary income with respect to a Unitholder.


The Trust and "AAA"Rating. Insurance guaranteeing the payments of
principal and interest, when due, on the Securities in the portfolio of the
Trust has been obtained from a municipal bond insurance company either by the
Trust, by a prior owner of the Bonds, by the issuer of the Bonds involved or
by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of the Bonds in the Trust. All issues of
the Trust are insured under one or more insurance policies obtained by the
Trust, if any, except for certain issues of certain Trusts for which insurance
has been obtained by the issuer of the Bonds involved, by a prior owner of the
Bonds or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of such Bonds in the Trust.
Insurance obtained by the Trust, if any, applies only while Bonds are retained
in the Trust while insurance obtained by a Bond issuer is effective so long as
such Bonds are outstanding. The Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond insured under
an insurance policy obtained by the Trust, has a right to obtain from the
insurer involved permanent insurance for such Bond upon the payment of a
single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from
the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Insurance relates only to the Bonds in
the Trust and not to the Units offered hereby or to the market value thereof.
As a result of such insurance, the Units of the Trust received a rating of
"AAA"by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group on the date the Trust was
created. Standard & Poor's Ratings Group has indicated that this rating is not
a recommendation to buy, hold or sell Units nor does it take into account the
extent to which expenses of the Trust or sales by the Trust of Bonds for less
than the purchase price paid by the Trust will reduce payment to Unitholders
of the interest and principal required to be paid on such Bonds. See "
Insurance on the Bonds"on page 5. No representation is made as to any
insurer's ability to meet its commitments.


Public Offering Price. The secondary market Public Offering Price will be
equal to the aggregate bid price of the Securities in the Trust and cash, if
any, in the Principal Account held or owned by the Trust plus the sales charge
referred to under "Public Offering". In addition, for Insured
Municipals Income Trust 152nd Insured Multi-Series and subsequent series and
Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust,
Multi-Series 213 and subsequent series, the Public Offering Price will include
Purchased Interest and accrued interest, if any. If the Bonds in the Trust
were available for direct purchase by investors, the purchase price of the
Bonds would not include the sales charge included in the Public Offering Price
of the Units.

Van Kampen American Capital




THE TRUST



Each series of Insured Municipals Income Trust and The First National Dual
Series Tax-Exempt Bond Trust (Insured Series) (the "Trust") was
created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Agreement
(the "Trust Agreement"), between Van Kampen American Capital
Distributors, Inc., as Sponsor, American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a
division of Van Kampen American Capital Investment Advisory Corp., as
Evaluator, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, or their respective
predecessors.


The Trust consists of a portfolio of interest-bearing obligations issued by or
on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion
of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross
income for Federal income tax under existing law, but may be subject to state
and local taxes. Unless otherwise terminated as provided therein, the Trust
Agreement for all series except the Limited Maturity, Intermediate and Short
Intermediate Series will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to
the fiftieth anniversary of its execution, while the Trust Agreement for the
Limited Maturity, Intermediate and Short Intermediate Series will terminate at
the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its
execution.


The portfolio of certain Trusts (including the Discount Series) may consist of
bonds that were purchased at a "market"discount from par value at
maturity. The coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they
were purchased and deposited in such Trust were lower than the current market
interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If such
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount
of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for
newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously
issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should also
note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in
value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates
decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased
at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market
premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher
yielding, premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding,
discount bonds will be reduced. A bond purchased at a market discount and held
to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of
taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest
income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See "
Tax Status."Market discount attributable to interest changes does not
indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue. Neither the Sponsor nor the
Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the Bonds.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust are "zero coupon"bonds. Zero coupon
bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the
right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not
receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount
bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon
bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but
also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such obligation.
This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of
being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as
the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates
the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this
reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price
fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are
securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently. See note (6) in
"Notes to Portfolio"in Part One of this Prospectus.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust
represented by each unredeemed Unit will increase, although the actual
interest in the Trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the Trustee by
Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor or the Underwriters, or until the
termination of the Trust Agreement. Units of the Trusts are not insured by the
FDIC, are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any
depository institution or any government agency and are subject to investment
risk, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.






OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION



The objectives of the Trust are income exempt from Federal income taxation and
conservation of capital through an investment in a diversified, insured
portfolio of Federal tax-exempt obligations. There is, of course, no guarantee
that the Trust will achieve its objective. The Trust may be an appropriate
investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of
tax-exempt fixed income securities with greater diversification than they
might be able to acquire individually. In addition, securities of the type
deposited in the Trust are often not available in small amounts.


Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the Bonds in the Trust has been obtained by the Trust from either
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity"), Financial Guaranty
Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") or a combination thereof
(collectively, the "Portfolio Insurers") or by the issuer of such
Bonds, by a prior owner of such Bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit
of such Bonds in the Trust from (1) AMBAC Indemnity or one of its
subsidiaries, American Municipal Bond Assurance Corporation ("AMBAC")
or MGIC Indemnity Corporation ("MGIC Indemnity"), (2) Financial
Guaranty, (3) Municipal Bond Insurance Association ("MBIA"), (4) Bond
Investors Guaranty Insurance Company ("BIG"), (5) National Union Fire
Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA. ("National Union"), (6) Capital
Guarantee Insurance Company ("Capital Guaranty"), (7) Capital Market
Assurance Corporation ("CapMAC") and/or (8) Financial Security
Assurance Inc. ("Financial Security"or "FSA") (collectively,
the "Preinsured Bond Insurers") (see "Insurance on the Bonds"
). Insurance obtained by the Trust is effective only while the Bonds thus
insured are held in the Trust. The Trustee has the right to acquire permanent
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer with respect to each Bond insured by the
respective Portfolio Insurer under a Trust portfolio insurance policy.
Insurance relating to Bonds insured by the issuer, by a prior owner of such
Bonds or by the Sponsor is effective so long as such Bonds are outstanding.
Bonds insured under a policy of insurance obtained by the issuer, by a prior
owner, or by the Sponsor from one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (the "
Preinsured Bonds") are not additionally insured by the Trust. No
representation is made as to any insurer's ability to meet its commitments.


Neither the Public Offering Price nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of
repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance
obtained by the Trust, if any, unless Bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. See "Public
Offering Price". On the other hand, the value, if any, of Preinsured Bond
insurance is reflected and included in the market value of such Bonds.


In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's
Ratings Group rating of "BBB"or at least the Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. rating of "Baa", which in brief represent the lowest
ratings for securities of investment grade (see "Description of Bond
Ratings"). Insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an
issuer, but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security
therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a non-cancellable policy for
the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds, when due, is issued
by the insurer. Any premium or premiums relating to Preinsured Bond insurance
is paid by the issuer, by a prior owner of such Bonds or by the Sponsor, and a
monthly premium is paid by an Insured Trust for the portfolio insurance, if
any, obtained by such Trust. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a Bond
insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Insurer by the
Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the
proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in the Trust is
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by the Portfolio
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers received a "AAA"rating by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group on the date such bonds were deposited in the
Trust. See "Insurance on the Bonds".


In selecting Bonds for the Trust, the following facts, among others, were
considered by the Sponsor: (a) either the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group
rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "BBB-"or the Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "
Baa"including provisional or conditional ratings, respectively, or, if
not rated, the Bonds had, in the opinion of the Sponsor, credit
characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of
interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations that were so rated as to be acceptable
for acquisition by the Trust (see "Description of Bond Ratings"), (b)
the prices of the Bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and
maturity, (c) the diversification of Bonds as to purpose of issue and location
of issuer, and (d) the availability and cost of insurance for the prompt
payment of principal and interest, when due, on the Bonds. Subsequent to the
Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced
below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires
elimination of such Bond from the portfolio but may be considered in the
Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose
of the Bond (see "Trust Administration Portfolio Administration").


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there was no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any Securities which might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Fund or any of the Trusts.
At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a
variety of grounds with respect to Securities in the Fund. Such litigation,
as, for example, suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue
bonds under environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such
Securities or the tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome
of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted, the Fund has
received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities
of each Security on the date of issuance to the effect that such Securities
have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from Federal
income tax. In addition, other factors may arise from time to time which
potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken
with respect to the Securities.



TRUST PORTFOLIO



Portfolio Concentrations. Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be general
obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of
such entity. In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such
an investment may entail. All other Bonds in the Trust are revenue bonds
payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not
supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are
secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the
payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are
payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of
facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or
other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the
security of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a particular
classification and between classifications, depending on numerous factors. See
"General"for each Trust.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations which derive their
payment from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured
or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of
acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages
on residences located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of
low or moderate income. In view of this an investment in the Trust should be
made with an understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the
risks which such an investment may entail. Mortgage loans are generally
partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of
events such as sale of the mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or
casualty loss. Because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory
redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a
substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their
scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates. Extraordinary
mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the
originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient
amounts within a specified time period. Additionally, unusually high rates of
default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the
payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. These
bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal Revenue Code, which

Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of
such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its tax-exempt
status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with
applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion
that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under
existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have
considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated
first redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with the housing Bonds
held by the Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit was not aware that any
of the respective issuers of such Bonds were actively considering the
redemption of such Bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be health care revenue bonds. In view of
this an investment in the Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such an investment may
entail. Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt may
service be affected by future events and conditions including, among other
things, demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the
services required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management
capabilities, competition with other health care facilities, efforts by
insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar
third party payor programs, government regulation and the termination or
restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated
with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. Pursuant
to recent Federal legislation, Medicare reimbursements are currently
calculated on a prospective basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of
rates. Prior to such legislation Medicare reimbursements were based on the
actual costs incurred by the health facility. The current legislation may
adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services
provided under the Medicare program. Such adverse changes also may adversely
affect the ratings of the Securities held in the portfolio of the Trust;
however, because of the insurance obtained by the Trust, the "AAA"
rating of the Units of the Trust would not be affected.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations of public utility
issuers, including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas.
In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such
an investment may entail. General problems of such issuers would include the
difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period,
the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to
environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital market in
absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices
and the effect of energy conservation. All of such issuers have been
experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees. In addition,
Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time
review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect
the ability of the issuers of certain of the Bonds in the portfolio to make
payments of principal and/or interest on such Bonds.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues
are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. In view of this
an investment in the Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such an investment may
entail. Such bonds are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such
issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases,
population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of
financing large construction programs, the limitations on operations and
increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the
increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water,
the effect of conservation programs and the impact of "no-growth"
zoning ordinances. All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these
problems in varying degrees.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be industrial revenue bonds ("
IRBs"). In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such
an investment may entail. IRBs have generally been issued under bond
resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the
arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and
pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may
have been granted as security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure,
payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate
operator of the project or corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or
guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on
the credit quality of the particular company or industry. These include
cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and environmental
restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or environmentally-caused
illnesses, extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a
corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buy-out, takeover or
otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project
becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's creditworthiness
which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or market value
of such Bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may have an
adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such Bonds,
even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or
effected.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations that are secured by lease
payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of
participation. In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which
such an investment may entail. Although the lease obligations do not
constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the
municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation lease is ordinarily
backed by the municipality's covenant to budget for, appropriate and make the
payments due under the lease obligation. However, certain lease obligations
contain "non-appropriation"clauses which provide that the
municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless
money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A governmental
entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future
governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take
such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets
and to make the appropriations therefor.A governmental entity's failure to
appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result
in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured
thereby. Although "non-appropriation"lease obligations are secured by
the leased property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure
might prove difficult.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations of issuers which are, or
which govern the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose
revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education
systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. In view of
this an investment in the Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such an investment may
entail. General problems relating to school bonds include litigation
contesting the State constitutionality of financing public education in part
from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a disparity in educational funds
available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or
legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the
payment of school bonds in the Trust. General problems relating to college and
university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the
population consisting of "college"age individuals, possible inability
to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs,
the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding, and
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues
or costs of such issuers. All of such issuers have been experiencing certain
of these problems in varying degrees.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations which are payable from
and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities
such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and
arenas. In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such
an investment may entail. The major portion of an airport's gross operating
income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines
pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases,
occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income
may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their
obligations under the use agreements. The air transport industry is
experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased
competition, excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic
constraints and other factors, and several airlines are experiencing severe
financial difficulties. The Sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry
conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the
financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport
facility. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other facilities is dependent
on revenues from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on
turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be
adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased
cost of maintenance, decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative
modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be obligations which are payable from
and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery
facilities. In view of this an investment in the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of such issuers and the risks which such
an investment may entail. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process
solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource
recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon
the occurrence of certain circumstances, including but not limited to:

destruction or condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project
becoming void, unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic
availability of raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for
the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes
adversely affecting the operation of a project; administrative or judicial
actions which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive
liabilities. The Sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the
redemption of resource recovery bonds in such a Trust prior to the stated
maturity of the Bonds.


Bond Redemptions. Because certain of the Bonds in the Trust may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in
accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be
distributed to Unitholders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can be
given that the Trust will retain for any length of time its present size and
composition. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way
for any default, failure or defect in any Bond.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trust may be subject to redemption prior to their
stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for
retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to
redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A
refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before
maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call
provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is
at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of
redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the proceeds of the
called Bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution
of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent
interest distributions and it may also offset the current return on Units of
the Trust. The portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call
provisions, if any, with respect to each of the debt obligations.
Extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the
happening of certain events. Generally, events that may permit the
extraordinary optional redemption of Bonds or may require the mandatory
redemption of Bonds include, among others: a final determination that the
interest on the Bonds is taxable; the substantial damage or destruction by
fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the Bonds were
used; an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of its power
of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which
the proceeds of the Bonds were used; changes in the economic availability of
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities or technological or other
changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of
the Bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or
judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the
proceeds of the Bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or
which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities,
such as taxes, not imposed on the date the Bonds are issued on the issuer of
the Bonds or the user of the proceeds of the Bonds; an administrative or
judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the
operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the Bonds; an
overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of
the Bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the Bonds which may be applied to
redeem Bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the Bonds
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem Bonds. The issuer of
certain Bonds in a Trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell, upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion of its
rights to call Bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of
such Bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the
Bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A
third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions
with respect to a Bond at a time when the issuer of the Bond might not have
called a Bond for redemption had it not sold such rights. The Sponsor is
unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption
of an issue of Bonds. See "Trust Portfolio"and note (3) in "Notes
to Portfolio"in Part One of this Prospectus. See also the discussion of
single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more
information on the call provisions of such bonds.



ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURNS AND ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RETURNS



As of the opening of business on the date indicated therein, the Estimated
Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns for each Trust under the
monthly and semi-annual distribution plans were as set forth under "Per
Unit Information"for the applicable Trust in Part One of this Prospectus.
Estimated Current Returns are calculated by dividing the Estimated Net Annual
Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The Estimated Net
Annual Interest Income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of
the Trustee and the Evaluator and with the principal prepayment, redemption,
maturity, exchange or sale of Securities while the Public Offering Price will
vary with changes in the offering price of the underlying Securities and with
changes in Purchased Interest for those series which contain Purchased
Interest; therefore, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current
Returns will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Returns are
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of
discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the Securities in the Trust and

(2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each
Trust Unit. Since the market values and estimated retirements of the
Securities and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance
that the present Estimated Long-Term Returns will be realized in the future.
Estimated Current Returns and Estimated Long-Term Returns are expected to
differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Returns reflects the
estimated date and amount of principal returned while Estimated Current
Returns calculations include only Net Annual Interest Income and Public
Offering Price.



TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES



Compensation of Sponsor and Evaluator. The Sponsor will not receive any fees
in connection with its activities relating to the Trust. However, in
connection with certain series of the Trust, American Portfolio Evaluation
Services, a division of Van Kampen American Capital Investment Advisory
Corp.,which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sponsor (the "
Evaluator"), will receive an annual supervisory fee, which is not to
exceed the amount set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information"in Part One of this Prospectus, for providing portfolio
supervisory services for such series. Such fee (which is based on the number
of Units outstanding in the Trust on January 1 of each year) may exceed the
actual costs of providing such supervisory services for such series, but at no
time will the total amount received for portfolio supervisory services
rendered to all series of Insured Municipals Income Trust in any calendar year
exceed the aggregate cost to the Evaluator of supplying such services in such
year. In addition, the Evaluator shall receive an annual evaluation fee in the
amount set forth in "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
(which is based on the outstanding principal amount of Securities on January 1
of each year) for regularly evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both of the
foregoing fees may be increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts
not exceeding proportionate increases under the category "All Services
Less Rent of Shelter"in the Consumer Price Index published by the United
States Department of Labor or, if such category is no longer published, in a
comparable category. The Sponsor and the dealers will receive sales
commissions and may realize other profits (or losses) in connection with the
sale of Units as described under "Public Offering".


Trustee's Fee. For its services, the Trustee will receive a fee from the Trust
based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Securities in the Trust
as of the opening of business on January 2 and July 2 of each year as set
forth under "Per Unit Information"for the applicable Trust in Part
One of this Prospectus. Such fee will be computed at the amounts set forth in
Part One to this Prospectus for that portion of the Trust under the
semi-annual distribution plan and for those portions of the Trust representing
monthly and quarterly distribution plans. The Trustee's fees are payable
monthly on or before the fifteenth day of each month from the Interest Account
to the extent funds are available and then from the Principal Account. Such
fees may be increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not
exceeding proportionate increases under the category "All Services Less
Rent of Shelter"in the Consumer Price Index published by the United
States Department of Labor or, if such category is no longer published, in a
comparable category. Since the Trustee has the use of the funds being held in
the Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of
expenses and redemptions and since such Accounts are non-interest bearing to
Unitholders, the Trustee benefits thereby. Part of the Trustee's compensation
for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of these
funds. For a discussion of the services rendered by the Trustee pursuant to
its obligations under the Trust Agreement, see "Rights of Unitholders
Reports Provided"and "Trust Administration".


Insurance Premiums. The cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the Trust,
if any, is the amount shown in "Summary of Essential Financial
Information"in Part One of this Prospectus. The premium is payable each
year that the Trust retains the Bonds. Premiums, if any, which are Trust
obligations, are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As
Bonds in the portfolio are redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by
the Trustee, the amount of the premium will be reduced in respect of those
Bonds no longer owned by and held in the Trust. If the Trustee exercises the
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related
Bonds. The premiums for such permanent insurance with respect to each Bond
will decline over the life of the Bond. The Trust does not incur any expense
for insurance which has been obtained by an issuer of a Bond, since the
premium or premiums for such insurance have been paid by the respective
issuers of such bonds. Bonds for which insurance has been obtained by the
issuer from one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers are not additionally insured
by the Trust. See "Objectives and Securities Selection".


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trust: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trust
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any Bonds in a
Trust and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination
of the Trust.


The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trust. When such
fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are secured by a
lien on the portfolio of the Trust. If the balances in the Interest and
Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts payable by the
Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell Securities to pay such amounts.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS



Insurance has been obtained by the Trust or by the issuer of such Bonds, or by
a prior owner of such Bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of such
Bonds in the Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal, when
due, in respect of the Bonds in the Trust. See "Objectives and Securities
Selection". An insurance policy obtained by the Trust, if any, is
non-cancellable and will continue in force so long as the Trust is in
existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still in business and the Bonds
described in such policy continue to be held by the Trust. Any portfolio
insurance premium for the Trust, which is an obligation of the Trust, is paid
by the Trust on a monthly basis. Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained
by the Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force
the insurer to take action against the Trustee to recover premium payments due
it. The Trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from the
Trust. Premium rates for each issue of Bonds protected by a policy obtained by
the Trust, if any, are fixed for the life of the Trust. The premium for any
Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid by such issuer, by a prior owner of
such Bonds or the Sponsor and any such policy or policies are non-cancellable
and will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding and
the respective Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. If the provider of
an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under
such policy or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability of any such
insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers have no obligation to insure any
issue adversely affected by either of the above described events.


The aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by the Trust, if any,
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the Bonds as they
fall due. For the purposes of insurance obtained by the Trust, "when
due"generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal
and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a Bond defaults in the
payment of principal or interest on such Bond, (b) such issuer enters into a
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such Bond is accelerated, the
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option, in its sole discretion, after
receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default, bankruptcy
proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such
Bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the
Bond from the Trust prior to such Bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the Bonds or the value of the Units.
Insurance obtained by the Trust, if any, is only effective as to Bonds owned
by and held in the Trust. In the event of a sale of any such Bond by the
Trustee, such insurance terminates as to such Bond on the date of sale.


Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a Bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by
the Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such
Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the Bonds regardless of the indemnity of
the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a
single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from
the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in the Trust is
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise
the Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond proceeds less the insurance
premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) from
such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds were sold on an
uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to each Bond eligible for
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each
Bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any
change in creditworthiness of each Bond.


The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an advantage
to the Trust in that each Bond insured by a Trust insurance policy may be sold
out of the Trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto. Thus,
the value of the insurance, if any, at the time of sale, can be realized in
the market value of the Bond so sold (which is not the case in connection with
any value attributable to an Insured Trust's portfolio insurance). See "
Public Offering Price". Because any such insurance value may be realized
in the market value of the Bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the
Permanent Insurance option, the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event the
Trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of Bonds in default or
significant risk of default, it is much less likely that the Trust would need
at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the
Trust were to have no such option and (b) at the time of termination of the
Trust, if the Trust were holding defaulted Bonds or Bonds in significant risk
of default the Trust would not need to hold such Bonds until their respective
maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Trust's portfolio
insurance.


Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by the Trust, if any, has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention
of the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right
to obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or
redemption value of Units if the Bonds covered by such insurance are in
default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such
default. The value of the insurance will be the difference between (i) the
market value of a Bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest
or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to
obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses
attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value
of such Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. It is also the present
intention of the Trustee not to sell such Bonds to effect redemptions or for
any other reason but rather to retain them in the portfolio because value
attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon sale. See "Public
Offering Price"herein for a more complete description of the Trust's
method of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a significant risk of
default. Insurance obtained by the issuer of a Bond is effective so long as
such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance may be considered to
represent an element of market value in regard to the Bonds thus insured, but
the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on such market value cannot be
predicted.


The portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by the Trust, if any, with
respect to the Bonds in the Trust were issued by one or more of the Portfolio
Insurers. Any other Preinsured Bond insurance policy (or commitment therefor)
was issued by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers. See "Objectives and
Securities Selection".

licensed in 48 states in addition to the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territory of Guam. CapMAC insures
structured asset-backed, corporate and other financial obligations in the
domestic and foreign capital markets. CapMAC may also provide financial
guarantee reinsurance for structured asset-backed, corporate and municipal
obligations written by other major insurance companies.


CapMAC's claims-paying ability is rated "Aaa"by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), "AAA"by Standard & Poor's, and
"AAA"by Duff & Phelps, Inc. ("Duff & Phelps"). Such ratings
reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies, are not

that is owned by a group of institutional and other investors, including
CapMAC's management and employees. CapMAC commenced operations on December 24,
1987 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Citibank (New York State), a

under any surety bond issued by CapMAC or any debts of CapMAC or to make
additional capital contributions.


CapMAC is regulated by the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New
York. In addition, CapMAC is subject to regulation by the insurance
departments of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. CapMAC is
subject to periodic regulatory examinations by the same regulatory
authorities.


CapMAC is bound by insurance laws and regulations regarding capital transfers,
limitations upon dividends, investment of assets, changes in control,
transactions with affiliates and consolidations and acquisitions. The amount
of exposure per risk that CapMAC may retain, after giving effect to
reinsurance, collateral or other security, is also regulated. Statutory and
regulatory accounting practices may prescribe appropriate rates at which
premiums are earned and the levels of reserves required. In addition, various
insurance laws restrict the incurrence of debt, regulate permissible
investments of reserves, capital and surplus, and govern the form of surety
bonds.


CapMAC's obligations under the Surety Bond(s) may be reinsured. Such
reinsurance does not relieve CapMAC of any of its obligations under the Surety
Bond(s).



THE POLICY IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE SECURITY FUND
SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 76 OF THE NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW.



As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, CapMAC had statutory capital (which consists
of policyholders' surplus and contingency reserve) of approximately $168
million and $163 million, respectively, and had not incurred any debt
obligations. Article 69 of the New York State Insurance Law requires that
CapMAC establishes and maintains the contingency reserve.


In addition to its qualified statutory capital and other reinsurance available
to pay claims under its policies, CapMAC has entered into a Stop Loss
Reinsurance Agreement (the "Stop Loss Agreement") with Winterthur
Swiss Insurance Company (the "Reinsurer"), which is rated AAA by
Standard & Poor's and Aaa by Moody's, pursuant to which the Reinsurer will be
required to pay any losses incurred by CapMAC during the term of the Stop Loss
Agreement on the surety bonds covered under the Stop Loss Agreement in excess
of a specified amount of losses incurred by CapMAC under such surety bonds
(such specified amount initially being $100 million and increasing annually by
an amount equal to 66-2/3% of the increase in CapMAC's statutory capital and
surplus) up to an aggregate limit payable under the Stop Loss Agreement of $50
million. The Stop Loss Agreement has an initial term of seven years, is
extendable for one-year periods and is subject to early termination upon the
occurrence of certain events.


CapMAC also has available a $100,000,000 standby corporate liquidity facility
(the "Liquidity Facility") provided by a syndicate of banks rated A1+
/P1 by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The Liquidity Facility is
currently scheduled to expire in June 1997 and may be extended from time to
time. Under the Liquidity Facility CapMAC will be able, subject to satisfying
certain conditions, to borrow funds from time to time in order to enable it to
fund any claim payments or payments made in settlement or mitigation of claims
payments under its surety bonds, including the Policy.


Copies of CapMAC's financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory
accounting standards, which differ from generally accepted accounting
principles, and filed with the Insurance Department of the State of New York
are available upon request. CapMAC is located at 885 Third Avenue, New York,
New York 10022, and its telephone number is (212) 755-1155.


In order to be in the Trust, Bonds must be insured by one of the Preinsured
Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by the Trust. In
determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured Bond Insurers; AMBAC
Indemnity and Financial Guaranty, have applied their own standards which
correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the
insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily
the criteria used in the selection of Bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the
standards of the Preinsured Bond Insurers; AMBAC Indemnity and Financial
Guaranty, are more restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously
stated Trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the Bonds.
This decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not
eligible for insurance are not deposited in the Trust. Thus, all Bonds in the
portfolio are insured either by the Trust or by the issuer of the Bonds, by a
prior owner of such Bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of such
Bonds in the Trust.


Because the Bonds are insured by one of the Portfolio Insurers or one of the
Preinsured Bond Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest,
when due, and on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect,
Standard & Poor's has assigned to the Units of the Trust its "AAA"
investment rating. See "Description of Bond Ratings". The obtaining of
this rating by the Trust should not be construed as an approval of the
offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market
value of the Trust or of the Units.


The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return on an
identical portfolio without the insurance obtained by the Trust would have
been higher than the Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term
Return on the Securities in the Trust after payment of the insurance premium.
An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by the Trust is to obtain a
higher yield on the Trust portfolio than would be available if all the
Securities in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA"rating and
yet at the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of
interest and principal, when due, on the Bonds. There is, of course, no
certainty that this result will be achieved. Preinsured bonds in the Trust
which have been insured by the issuer (all of which are rated "AAA"by
Standard & Poor's) may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds
rated "AAA"by Standard & Poor's. In selecting such Bonds for the
portfolio, the Sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of a
Bond, AMBAC Indemnity shall make such payment not later than 30 days and
Financial Guaranty shall make such payment within one business day after the
respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is
threatened (but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer,
as regards any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee
in respect thereof. All policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the
Preinsured Bond Insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to
the Trust are concerned.


The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable
from Federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the
municipal obligations. Holders of Units in the Trust should discuss with their
tax advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter
ruling. However, Chapman and Cutler, counsel for the Sponsor, has given an
opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from
Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as, such interest would have
been so excludable if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations. See
"Tax Status".


Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance
in each state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform
on its contracts of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder
at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no claims
have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio
Insurers which would materially impair the ability of such company to meet its
commitments pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance.


The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates
thereof.



TAX STATUS



At the time of the closing for each Trust, Chapman and Cutler, counsel for the
Sponsor, rendered an opinion substantially to the effect that:


(1)Each Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for Federal
income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on Bonds
which is excludable from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code") will retain its status when distributed to Unitholders,
except to the extent such interest is subject to the alternative minimum tax,
an additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental
tax (the "Superfund Tax"), as noted below;


(2)Each Unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the
respective Trust under subpart E, subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and
will have a taxable event when such Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the
Unitholder redeems or sells his Units. Unitholders must reduce the tax basis
of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective
Trust, if any, on Bonds delivered after the Unitholders pay for their Units to
the extent that such interest accrued on such Bonds during the period from the
Unitholder's settlement date to the date such Bonds are delivered to the
respective Trust and, consequently, such Unitholders may have an increase in
taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units.
Gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the Units. If
the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on maturity,
redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the Unitholder. The
amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unitholder's pro
rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the Unitholder's
basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of. In the case
of a Unitholder who purchases Units, such basis (before adjustment for earned
original issue discount and amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by
apportioning the cost of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably
according to value as of the date of acquisition of the Units. The tax cost
reduction requirements of the Code relating to amortization of bond premium
may, under some circumstances, result in the Unitholder realizing a taxable
gain when his Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to his original
cost;


(3)Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy or policies dated the Date of
Deposit, issued to an Insured Trust by AMBAC Indemnity, Financial Guaranty or
a combination thereof with respect to the Bonds which represent maturing
interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be excludable from
Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as, such interest would have
been so excludable if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations provided
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the obligations, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the obligations; and


(4)Any proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of Bonds
which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee
will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as,
such interest would have been excludable if paid in the normal course by the
issuer of the defaulted obligations provided that, at the time such policies
are purchased, the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary
and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the
obligations, rather than the insurer, will pay debt service on the
obligations.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules governing
the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide that original
issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest
rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending on the date the Bond was
issued. In addition, special rules apply if the purchase price of a Bond
exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount
which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price (its "
adjusted issue price") to prior owners. The application of these rules
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unitholder
acquires his Units and the price the Unitholder pays for his Units. Investors
with questions regarding these Code sections should consult with their tax
advisers.


"The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993"(the "Tax Act")
subjects tax-exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective
for bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an
investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference, if any,
is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued), subject to a
statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on the price a
Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unitholder pays for his or her Units.
Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income;
under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain. Market
discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond would be recognized as
ordinary income by the Unitholders when principal payments are received on the
Bond, upon sale or at redemption (including early redemption), or upon the
sale or redemption of his or her Units, unless a Unitholder elects to include
market discount in taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are
complex and Unitholders should consult their tax advisers regarding these
rules and their application.


In the case of certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the
Superfund Tax for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depends upon
the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income, which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the adjustment
items used in computing the alternative minimum taxable income and the
Superfund Tax of a corporation (other than an S Corporation, Regulated
Investment Company, Real Estate Investment Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal
to 75% of the excess of such corporation's "adjusted current earnings"
over an amount equal to its alternative minimum taxable income (before such
adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction). "
Adjusted current earnings"includes all tax exempt interest, including
interest on all of the Bonds in the Fund. Unitholders are urged to consult
their tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them
including the corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the
branch profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the Code,
interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units of a
Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax purposes. The Internal Revenue
Service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly
traceable to the purchase or carrying of Units (however, these rules generally
do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve
a personal residence). Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial
institutions that acquire Units would generally not be able to deduct any of
the interest expense attributable to ownership of such Units. Investors with
questions regarding this issue should consult with their tax advisers.


In the case of certain of the Bonds in the Fund, the opinions of bond counsel
indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial user"
of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds, or persons
related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by such a user or
related person, will not be excludible from Federal gross income, although
interest on such Bonds received by others would be excludible from Federal
gross income. "Substantial user"and "related person"are
defined under U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any person who believes that he or
she may be a "substantial user"or a "related person"as so
defined should contact his or her tax adviser.


In the opinion of special counsel to the Fund for New York tax matters, under
existing law, the Fund and each Trust are not associations taxable as
corporations and the income of each Trust will be treated as the income of the
Unitholders under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York.


All statements of law in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income
for Federal, state or other tax purposes are the opinions of counsel and are
to be so construed.


At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the
validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from Federal gross
income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities.
Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis
for such opinions.


In the case of corporations, the alternative tax rate applicable to long-term
capital gains is 35%, effective for long-term capital gains realized in
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1993. For taxpayers other than
corporations, net capital gains are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax
rate of 28%. However, it should be noted that legislative proposals are
introduced from time to time that affect tax rates and could affect relative
differences at which ordinary income and capital gains are taxed. Under the
Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service the amount of
tax-exempt interest earned during the year.


Section 86 of the Code, in general, provides that 50% of Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of "
modified adjusted gross income"plus 50% of the Social Security benefits
received exceeds a "base amount". The base amount is $25,000 for
unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and
zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the
taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted gross income is
adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable
deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including tax-exempt
interest. To the extent that Social Security benefits are includible in gross
income, they will be treated as any other item of gross income.


In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31,
1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible in gross income to
the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross income"plus 50%
of Social Security benefits received exceeds an "adjusted base amount."
The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for
married taxpayers filing a joint return, and zero for married taxpayers who do
not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate
returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income
solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of Social Security
benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt interest, including
that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax. A taxpayer whose adjusted
gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must
include 50% or 85%, respectively, of his Social Security benefits in gross
income whether or not he receives any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose
modified adjusted gross income (after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does
not exceed the base amount need not include any Social Security benefits in
gross income.


For a discussion of the state tax status of income earned on Units of a Trust,
see "Tax Status"for the applicable Trust. Except as noted therein,
the exemption of interest on state and local obligations for Federal income
tax purposes discussed above does not necessarily result in exemption under
the income or other tax laws of any State or City. The laws of the several
States vary with respect to the taxation of such obligations.



PUBLIC OFFERING



General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. In the secondary
market the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate bid price of the
Securities in the Trust and includes a sales charge determined in accordance
with the table set forth below, which is based upon the dollar weighted
average maturity of each Trust. In addition, for Insured Municipals Income
Trust, 152nd Insured Multi-Series and subsequent series and Insured Municipals
Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 213 and
subsequent series, the Public Offering Price will include Purchased Interest.
For purposes of this computation, Bonds will be deemed to mature on their
expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the Bonds have been called for redemption
or funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier
call date, in which case such call date will be deemed to be the date upon
which they mature; or (b) such Bonds are subject to a "mandatory
tender", in which case such mandatory tender will be deemed to be the date
upon which they mature.


The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different
sales charge rates will be applied to each Trust based upon the dollar
weighted average maturity of such Trust's Portfolio, in accordance with the
following schedule:








Years To Maturity    Sales Charge    Years To Maturity                Sales Charge
1 ..................          1.523% 9...............................          4.712%
2 ..................           2.041 10..............................           4.932
3 ..................           2.564 11..............................           4.932
4 ..................           3.199 12..............................           4.932
5 ..................           3.842 13..............................           5.374
6 ..................           4.058 14..............................           5.374
7 ..................           4.275 15..............................           5.374
8 ..................           4.493 16 to 30 . . . . . . . . . . ...           6.045








The sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the
aggregate bid prices of the securities in the Trust. Expressed as a percent of
the Public Offering Price (excluding Purchased Interest for those Trusts which
contain Purchased Interest), the sales charge on a Trust consisting entirely
of a portfolio of Bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 5.10%.


THE FOLLOWING SECTION "ACCRUED INTEREST (ACCRUED INTEREST TO CARRY),"
APPLIES TO INSURED MUNICIPALS INCOME TRUST, 151st INSURED MULTI-SERIES AND ALL
PRIOR SERIES, AND TO INSURED MUNICIPALS INCOME TRUST AND INVESTORS' QUALITY
TAX-EXEMPT TRUST, MULTI-SERIES 212 AND ALL PRIOR SERIES ONLY.


Accrued Interest (Accrued Interest To Carry). Accrued interest to carry
consists of two elements. The first element arises as a result of accrued
interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last
day on which interest thereon was paid. Interest on Securities in each Trust
is actually paid either monthly, quarterly, if applicable, or semi-annually to
such Trust. However, interest on the Securities in each Trust is accounted for
daily on an accrual basis. Because of this, each Trust always has an amount of
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee because of coupons that
are not yet due. For this reason, the Public Offering Price will have added to
it the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest to the date
of settlement.


The second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the
structure of the Interest Account. The Trustee has no cash for distribution to
Unitholders of a Trust until it receives interest payments on the Securities
in such Trust. The Trustee is obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in
order to advance interest distributions. The Trustee will recover these
advancements when such interest is received. Interest Account balances are
established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the
Trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest
distributions. The Interest Account balances are also structured so that there
will generally be positive cash balances and since the funds held by the
Trustee may be used by it to earn interest thereon, it benefits thereby. If a
Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units or if the Bonds in a
Trust are sold or otherwise removed or if a Trust is liquidated, he will
receive at that time his proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry
computed to the settlement date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the
date of tender in the case of redemption.



THE FOLLOWING SECTION "PURCHASED AND ACCRUED INTEREST,"APPLIES TO


INSURED MUNICIPALS INCOME TRUST, 152nd INSURED MULTI-SERIES AND ALL SUBSEQUENT
SERIES, AND TO INSURED MUNICIPALS INCOME TRUST AND INVESTORS' QUALITY
TAX-EXEMPT TRUST, MULTI-SERIES 213 AND ALL SUBSEQUENT SERIES ONLY.



Purchased and Accrued Interest



Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a portion of the unpaid interest
that has accrued on the Securities from the later of the last payment date on
the Securities or the date of issuance thereof through the First Settlement
Date and is included in the calculation of the Public Offering Price.
Purchased Interest will be distributed to Unitholders as Units are redeemed or
Securities mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Financial
Information"in Part One of this Prospectus for the amount of Purchased
Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of the
price Unitholders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of
Units prior to the termination of a Trust.


Accrued Interest. Accrued Interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although a Trust accrues
such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of interest
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reasons, the Public
Offering Price of Units will have added to it the proportionate share of
accrued interest to the date of settlement. Unitholders will receive on the
next distribution date of a Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid
on their Units.


As indicated in "Purchased Interest", accrued interest as of the First
Settlement Date includes Purchased Interest. In an effort to reduce the amount
of Purchased Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by Unitholders,
the Trustee may advance a portion of such accrued interest to the Sponsor as
the Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the
amount of accrued interest to be added to the Public Offering Price of Units
will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date to the date
of settlement (other than the Purchased Interest already included therein),
less any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the First
Settlement Date. See "DistributionsDistribution of Interest and
Principal."


Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Securities, accrued
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest
actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders. If a Unitholder
sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be entitled to receive
his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest and accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units. Since the Trustee has the use of the funds
(including Purchased Interest) held in the Interest Account for distributions
to Unitholders and since such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unitholders,
the Trustee benefits thereby.


Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of the Units will vary from the
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"in
Part One of this Prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of
the underlying Securities in the Trust. The price of the Units as of the
opening of business on the date of Part One of this Prospectus was determined
by adding to the determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds the
amount of the sales charge expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid
price of the Securities plus Purchased Interest for those Trusts which contain
Purchased Interest, and dividing the sum so obtained by the number of Units
outstanding. This computation produced a gross profit equal to the sales
charge expressed as a percentage of the Public Offering Price (excluding
Purchased Interest). For secondary market purposes an appraisal and adjustment
with respect to the Trust will be made by the Evaluator as of 4:00 P.M.
Eastern time on days on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for each day
on which any Unit of the Trust is tendered for redemption, and it shall
determine the aggregate value of the Trust as of 4:00 P.M. Eastern time on
such other days as may be necessary.


The aggregate price of the Securities in the Trust has been and will be
determined on the basis of bid prices: (a) on the basis of current market
prices for the Securities obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily
deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust; (b) if such prices are
not available for any particular Securities, on the basis of current market
prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the Securities to be
determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting or
appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market
prices of the Securities will generally fluctuate with changes in market
interest rates. Unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or
interest or in significant risk of such default, the Evaluator will not
attribute any value to the insurance obtained by the Trust.


The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are in default in
payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of the
insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value of the
insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of
Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent
Insurance (less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to
the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such
Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the Evaluator
will consider the ability of the affected Portfolio Insurer to meet its
commitments under any Trust insurance policy, including the commitments to
issue Permanent Insurance. It is the position of the Sponsor that this is a
fair method of valuing the Bonds and the insurance obtained by the Trust and
reflects a proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.


Although payment is normally made five business days following the order for
purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. However, delivery of certificates
representing Units so ordered will be made five business days following such
order or shortly thereafter. A person will become the owner of Units on the
date of settlement provided payment has been received. Cash, if any, made
available to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of
Units may be used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit
to the Sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. See "Rights of Unitholders-Redemption of Units"for information
regarding the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.


Unit Distribution. Units repurchased in the secondary market, if any, may be
offered by this Prospectus at the secondary Public Offering Price in the
manner described.


Broker-dealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in
connection with secondary market transactions in the amount of 70% of the
applicable sales charge as determined using the table found in "Public
Offering General". Certain commercial banks are making Units of the Trust
available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge
(equal to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted
to the banks. Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from
underwriting Trust Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does permit certain
agency transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these
particular agency transactions are not permitted under such Act. In addition,
state securities laws on this issue may differ from the interpretations of
federal law expressed herein and banks and financial institutions may be
required to register as dealers pursuant to state law. The minimum purchase in
the secondary market will be one Unit.


Broker-dealers of the Trusts and/or others may be eligible to participate in a
program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal award for each
of their registered representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of
unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under
which the sales forces of brokers, dealers, and/or others may be eligible to
win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor
will reallow to any such brokers, dealers, and/or others that sponsor sales
contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the
Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount
not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by
such persons at the public offering price during such programs. Also, the
Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria
established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokers, dealers or others
for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in
sales of Units of the Trust. Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its
own assets, and not out of the assets of the Trust. These programs will not
change the price Unitholders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trust
will receive from the Units sold.


The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for
the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission to dealers and others from time to time.


Sponsor and Dealer Profits. Dealers will receive the gross sales commission as
described under "Public Offering General"above.


As stated under "Market for Units"below, the Sponsor intends to, and
certain of the dealers may, maintain a secondary market for the Units of the
Trust. In so maintaining a market, the Sponsor or any such dealer will realize
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the price at
which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold. In
addition, the Sponsor or any such dealer will also realize profits or sustain
losses resulting from a redemption of such repurchased Units at a price above
or below the purchase price for such Units, respectively.


Market for Units. Although they are not obligated to do so, the Sponsor
intends to, and certain of the dealers may, maintain a market for the Units
offered hereby and to offer continuously to purchase such Units at prices,
subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the
Securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus Purchased Interest, if any,
plus interest accrued to the date of settlement plus any principal cash on
hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges
payable out of the Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor
and/or the dealers may either discontinue all purchases of Units or
discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is
not maintained for the Units and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser,
a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to dispose of such
Units only by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption
Price, which is based upon the aggregate bid price of the Securities in the
portfolio of such Trust, plus Purchased Interest, if any, and any accrued
interest. The aggregate bid prices of the underlying Securities in the Trust
are expected to be less than the related aggregate offering prices. See "
Rights of Unitholders  Redemption of Units."A Unitholder who wishes to
dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices
in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the
Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS



Certificates. The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units
that person who is registered as such owner on the books of the Trustee.
Ownership of Units of the Trust is evidenced by separate registered
certificates executed by the Trustee and the Sponsor. Certificates are
transferable by presentation and surrender to the Trustee properly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder
must sign exactly as his name appears on the face of the certificate with the
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program
in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the
Trustee. In certain instances the Trustee may require additional documents
such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates of death,
appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of corporate
authority.


Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, the Trustee may require a
Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each certificate reissued (other than
as a result of a change in plan of distribution) or transferred and to pay any
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with each such transfer
or interchange. Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be
replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of
ownership and payment of expenses incurred. Mutilated certificates must be
surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.


Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by the Trust,
including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of Securities which
Purchased Interest and/or represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. All distributions will be net of applicable expenses. The pro rata
share of cash in the Principal Account will be computed as of the semi-annual
record date, and distributions to the Unitholders as of such record date will
be made on or shortly after the fifteenth day of such month. For Insured
Municipals Income Trust, 152nd Insured Multi-Series and subsequent series and
for Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust,
Multi-Series 213 and subsequent series, such computation and distribution will
occur monthly. Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the Securities
after such record date and prior to the following distribution date will be
held in the Principal Account and not distributed until the next distribution
date. The Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the
Principal or Interest Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and
therefore benefits from the use of such funds) nor to make a distribution from
the Principal Account unless the amount available for distribution therein
shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


The distribution to the Unitholders as of each record date will be made on the
following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an
amount substantially equal to such portion of the Unitholders' pro rata share
of the Estimated Net Annual Unit Income in the Interest Account after
deducting estimated expenses attributable as is consistent with the
distribution plan chosen. Only monthly distributions are available for Insured
Because interest payments are not received by the Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, such interest distribution may be more or less than the
amount credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose
of minimizing fluctuation in the distributions from the Interest Account, the
Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide
interest distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee shall be
reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds in the Interest
Account on the ensuing record date. Persons who purchase Units between a
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on
the second distribution date after the purchase.


As of the first day of each month, the Trustee will deduct from the Interest
Account and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the
Principal Account, amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trust (as
determined on the basis set forth under "Trust Operating Expenses").
The Trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it
deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable
out of the Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the
Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of
such amounts to the appropriate accounts. In addition, the Trustee may
withdraw from the Interest and Principal Accounts such amounts as may be
necessary to cover redemptions of Units by the Trustee.


Distribution. Distributions of interest received by the Trust, prorated on an
annual basis, will be made semi-annually unless the Unitholder has elected to
receive them monthly or quarterly. Distributions of funds from the Principal
Account will be made on a semi-annual basis, except under the special
circumstances outlined in "Rights of Unitholders Distribution of Interest
and Principal"above. Record dates for monthly distributions will be the
first day of each month, record dates for quarterly distributions will be the
first day of March, June, September and December, and record dates for
semi-annual distributions will be the first day of June and December.
Distributions will be made on the fifteenth day of the month subsequent to the
respective record dates. Unitholders of Insured Municipals Income Trust, 152nd
Insured Multi-Series and subsequent series, and Insured Municipals Income
Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi- Series 213 and
subsequent series will receive distributions of income and principal, if any,
on a monthly basis.


Change of Distribution Option. The plan of distribution selected by a
Unitholder of Insured Municipals Income Trust, 151st Insured Multi-Series and
prior series and Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality
Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 212 and prior series; will remain in effect
until changed. Unitholders purchasing Units in the secondary market will
initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior
owner. Unitholders may change the plan of distribution in which they are
participating. For the convenience of Unitholders, the Trustee will furnish a
card for this purpose; cards may also be obtained upon request from the
Trustee. Unitholders desiring to change their plan of distribution may so
indicate on the card and return it, together with their certificate and such
other documentation that the Trustee may then require, to the Trustee.
Certificates should be sent only by registered or certified mail to minimize
the possibility of their being lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are
properly presented to the Trustee, the change will become effective for all
subsequent distributions.


Reinvestment Option. Unitholders of the Trust may elect to have each
distribution of interest income, capital gains and/or principal on their Units
automatically reinvested in shares of any of the open ended mutual funds
(except for B Shares) listed under "Trust Administration Sponsor"
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence. Such mutual funds
are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Reinvestment Funds."


Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives which differ in certain
respects from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment
Fund describes the investment policies of such fund and sets forth the
procedures to follow to commence reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a
prospectus for the respective Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen American
Capital Distributors, Inc. at One Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181. Texas residents who desire to reinvest may request that a broker-dealer
registered in Texas send the prospectus relating to the respective fund.


After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each distribution of
interest income, capital gains and/or principal on the participant's Units
will, on the applicable distribution date, automatically be applied, as
directed by such person, as of such distribution date by the Trustee to
purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at
a net asset value as computed as of the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on such date, plus a sales charge of $1.00 per $100 of reinvestment
except if the participant selects the Van Kampen Merritt Money Market Fund or
the Van Kampen Merritt Tax Free Money Market in which case no sales charge
applies. A minimum of one-half of such sales charge would be paid to Van
Kampen American Capital Distributors, Inc.


Confirmations of all reinvestments by a Unitholder into a Reinvestment Fund
will be mailed to the Unitholder by such Reinvestment Fund.


A participant may at any time prior to five days preceding the next succeeding
distribution date, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate
his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions on his or her
Units in cash. There will be no charge or other penalty for such termination.
Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and investment adviser shall have the
right to terminate at any time the reinvestment plan relating to such fund.


Reports Provided. The Trustee shall furnish Unitholders in connection with
each distribution a statement of the amount of interest and, if any, the
amount of other receipts (received since the preceding distribution) being
distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount representing the pro
rata share of each Unit outstanding. For as long as the Trustee deems it to be
in the best interests of the Unitholders, the accounts of the Trust shall be
audited, not less frequently than annually, by independent certified public
accountants and the report of such accountants shall be furnished by the
Trustee to Unitholders upon request. Within a reasonable period of time after
the end of each calendar year, the Trustee shall furnish to each person who at
any time during the calendar year was a registered Unitholder a statement (i)
as to the Interest Account: interest received (including amounts representing
interest received upon any disposition of Securities) and the percentage of
such interest by states in which the issuers of the Securities are located,
the amount of Purchased Interest, deductions for applicable taxes and for fees
and expenses of the Trust (including insurance costs), for redemptions of
Units, if any, and the balance remaining after such distributions and
deductions, expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a
dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; (ii) as to the Principal Account: the
dates of disposition of any Securities and the net proceeds received therefrom
(excluding any portion representing accrued interest), the amount paid for
redemptions of Units, if any, deductions for payment of applicable taxes and
fees and expenses of the Trustee, the amount of "when issued"interest
treated as a return of capital, if any, and the balance remaining after such
distributions and deductions expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a
dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; (iii) a list of the Securities held
and the number of Units outstanding on the last business day of such calendar
year; (iv) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the last computation
thereof made during such calendar year; and (v) amounts actually distributed
during such calendar year from the Interest and Principal Accounts, separately
stated, expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts
representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding.


In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,
Unitholders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations of the
Securities in the Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.


Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments
of transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity,
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment
of applicable governmental charges, if any. Thus, redemption of Units cannot
be effected until certificates representing such Units have been delivered to
the person seeking redemption or satisfactory indemnity provided. No
redemption fee will be charged. On the seventh calendar day following such
tender, or if the seventh calendar day is not a business day, on the first
business day prior thereto, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash
an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed
after receipt by the Trustee of such tender of Units. The "date of
tender"is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that as regards Units received after 4:00 P.M. Eastern time on
days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the next
day on which such Exchange is open for trading and such Units will be deemed
to have been tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the
redemption price computed on that day.


Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the Trustee will be
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a Unit
redemption if the Trustee has not been furnished the redeeming Unitholder's
tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations. Any
amount so withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be
recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender
Units for redemption, such Unitholder should provide a tax identification
number to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up
withholding"in the event the Trustee has not been previously provided
such number.


Purchased Interest, if applicable, and accrued interest paid on redemption
shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of the Trust or, if the balance
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be
withdrawn from the Principal Account. The Trustee is empowered to sell
underlying Securities in order to make funds available for redemption. Units
so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The Redemption Price per Unit will be determined on the basis of the bid price
of the Securities in the Trust as of 4:00 P.M. Eastern time on days of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on the date any such determination is made.
While the Trustee has the power to determine the Redemption Price per Unit
when Units are tendered for redemption, such authority has been delegated to
the Evaluator which determines the price per Unit on a daily basis. The
Redemption Price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust
determined on the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the
process of being collected, (ii) the value of the Securities in the Trust
based on the bid prices of the Securities, except for those cases in which the
value of insurance has been included, (iii) Purchased Interest for each Trust
and (iv) interest accrued thereon, less (a) amounts representing taxes or
other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. The Evaluator may determine the value of the Securities
in the Trust by employing any of the methods set forth in "Public Offering
Price". In determining the Redemption Price per Unit no value will be
assigned to the portfolio insurance maintained by the Trust on the Bonds in
the Trust unless such Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest
or in significant risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds insured under
a policy obtained by the issuer thereof are entitled to the benefits of such
insurance at all times and such benefits are reflected and included in the
market value of such Bonds. For a description of the situations in which the
Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by the Trust, see "Public
Offering Price".


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by
the Unitholder. As stated above, the Trustee may sell Securities to cover
redemptions. When Securities are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust
will be reduced. Such sales may be required at a time when Securities would
not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be
realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary
weekend and holiday closings, or during which the Securities and Exchange
Commission determines that trading on that Exchange is restricted or an
emergency exists, as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the
Securities in the Trust is not reasonably practicable, or for such other
periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit. Under
certain extreme circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an order permitting a full or partial suspension of
the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION



Sponsor Purchases of Units. The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender
of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that
time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, it may purchase such
Units by notifying the Trustee before the close of business on the second
succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the Unitholder not
later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have been redeemed by
the Trustee. Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered to the Trustee for
redemption as any other Units.


The offering price of any Units acquired by the Sponsor will be in accord with
the Public Offering Price described in the then currently effective prospectus
describing such Units. Any profit resulting from the resale of such Units will
belong to the Sponsor which likewise will bear any loss resulting from a lower
offering or redemption price subsequent to its acquisition of such Units.


Portfolio Administration. The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of
redeeming Units tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses
for which funds may not be available, such of the Bonds designated by the
Evaluator as the Trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The
Evaluator, in designating such Bonds, will consider a variety of factors,
including (a) interest rates, (b) market value and (c) marketability. To the
extent that Bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and
interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted Bonds are retained
in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection
applicable to said Bonds, the overall quality of the Bonds remaining in the
Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. Except as described below and in
certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the Trustee
to be in the best interests of the Unitholders or if there is no alternative,
the Trustee is not empowered to sell Bonds which are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in such significant risk of such default and for
which value has been attributed for the insurance obtained by the Trust.
Because of such restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances the
Sponsor may seek a full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to
redeem their Units. See "Rights of Unitholders  Redemption of Units".
The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose
of Bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.


The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by an
issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or
substitution for any Bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper
if (1) the issuer is in default with respect to such Bond or (2) in the
written opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect
to such Bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received
in exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms
and conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as Bonds originally
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in
exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the Trustee is required to give
notice thereof to each Unitholder, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the
Bonds substituted therefor. Except as stated herein, the acquisition by the
Trust of any securities other than the Bonds initially deposited is not
permitted.


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any Bond occurs and
no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to
hold such Bond within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor
of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and
not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.


Amendment or Termination. The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend
the Trust Agreement without the consent of any of the Unitholders when such an
amendment is (a) to cure an ambiguity or to correct or supplement any
provision of the Trust Agreement which may be defective or inconsistent with
any other provision contained therein or (b) to make such other provisions as
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in
good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee), provided that the Trust Agreement
may not be amended to increase the number of Units issuable thereunder or to
permit the deposit or acquisition of securities either in addition to or in
substitution for any of the Securities initially deposited in the Trust,
except for the substitution of certain refunding securities for such Bonds. In
the event of any amendment, the Trustee is obligated to notify promptly all
Unitholders of the substance of such amendment.


All Trusts other than those indicated in the next sentence may be terminated
at any time by consent of Unitholders representing 100% of the Units of the
Trust then outstanding. Each series of Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series
98 and subsequent series may be terminated at any time by consent of the
Unitholders representing 51% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding. In
addition, a Trust may be terminated by the Trustee when the value of the
Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than that indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"in Part One of this
Prospectus.


The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust shall terminate upon the
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust,
but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year indicated under
"The Trust". In the event of termination of the Trust, written notice
thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder thereof at his address
appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the Trustee.
Within a reasonable time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any Securities
then held in the Trust and shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any
accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement,
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and
any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable
taxes or other governmental charges. The sale of Securities in the Trust upon
termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if
such sale were not required at such time. For this reason, among others, the
amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than the
principal amount of Securities represented by the Units held by such
Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each Unitholder his share of
the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With such distribution the
Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount
distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall
determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it shall
make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to
Unitholders, it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained
by the Trust is applicable only while Bonds so insured are held by the Trust,
the price to be received by the Trust upon the disposition of any such Bond
which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest, will
not reflect any value based on such insurance. Therefore, in connection with
any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the Trustee to, and the Trustee
does not currently intend to, dispose of any Bond or Bonds if retention of
such Bond or Bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in the best interest of
Unitholders, including, but not limited to situations in which a Bond or Bonds
so insured are in default and situations in which a Bond or Bonds so insured
have a deteriorated market price resulting from a significant risk of default.
Since the Bonds which are insured by insurance obtained by the Bond issuer
will reflect the value of the related insurance, it is the present intention
of the Sponsor not to direct the Trustee to hold any of such Bonds after the
date of termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from
insurance on defaulted Bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will
ultimately be distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of
termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted Bond or Bonds
become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the
Trustee.


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, the Evaluator and the Trustee shall be
under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for refraining from
taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors
in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence (gross negligence in the case of the Sponsor) in the
performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless disregard of their
obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be liable for
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement.


The Trustee shall not be liable for any taxes or other governmental charges
imposed upon or in respect of the Securities or upon the interest thereon or
upon it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement or upon or in respect of the
Trust which the Trustee maybe required to pay under any present or future law
of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority having
jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary
provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee.


The Trustee, Sponsor and Unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by
the Evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
Determinations by the Evaluator under the Trust Agreement shall be made in
good faith upon the basis of the best of information available to it,
provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no liability to the
Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment. This provision shall
not protect the Evaluator in any case of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard to its obligations and duties.

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its offices at 101 Barclay
Street, New York, New York 10286 (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is
subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the
State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to
the extent permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.


In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by
the Trust to, every Unitholder of the Trust. Such books and records shall be
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may
from time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute,
rule or regulation (see "Unitholders Explanations - Public Offering -
Reports Provided"). The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or
duplicate original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for
inspection at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any
Unitholder, together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign and
be discharged of the Trust created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor
trustee promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been
appointed and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification,
the retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.


Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS*



Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. A Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("
Standard & Poor's") corporate or municipal bond rating is a current
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
debt obligation. This assessment of creditworthiness may take into
consideration obligors such as guarantors, insurers or lessees.


The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.


The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's by
the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, such information. The ratings are based, in
varying degrees, on the following considerations:


Likelihood of default capacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely
payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of
the obligation.


Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the event
of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of
bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


AAA  This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt
obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and
interest.


AA  Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances
they differ from AAA issues only in small degree.


A  Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes
in circumstances and economic conditions.


BBB Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances
are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay
principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories.


*As published by the rating companies.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit quality,
the ratings from "AA"to "BBB"may be modified by the addition
of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating
categories.


Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating "(p)"assumes the successful
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to
completion, makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon
failure of, such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own
judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk.


Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating symbols and their meanings
follows:


Aaa  Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "
gilt edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an
exceptionally stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized
are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.
With the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the
safety of obligations of this class is so absolute that their market value is
affected solely by money market fluctuation.


Aa  Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known
as high grad e bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins
of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of
oversupply in a few specific instances.


A  Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving
security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may
be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the
future. The market value of A rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by
credit circumstances during a sustained period of depressed business
conditions. During periods of normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move
in parallel with Aaa and Aa obligations, with the occasional exception of
oversupply in a few specific instances.


Baa Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;

i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well.


Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the
high end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and
the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic
rating category.


Con  Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of
projects unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when
facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting
condition attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon
completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition.


No person is authorized to give any information or to make any representation
not contained in this Prospectus; and any information or representation not
contained herein must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the
Trust, the Sponsor or the dealers. This Prospectus does not constitute an
offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any state
to any persons to whom it is not lawful to make such offer in such state.
