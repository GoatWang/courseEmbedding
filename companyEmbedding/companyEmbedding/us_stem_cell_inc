LAS VEGAS, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
Stem cell therapies are a key component of the regenerative medicine field that promises to be a revolutionary approach to treating many degenerative conditions by repairing damaged tissue and harnessing the body's ability to heal itself. Biotech companies in focus include: Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: ENDV), Pulse Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:   PLSE), Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:   PSTI), Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CYTX) and Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CAPR).








However, when looking at this great promise in terms of return on investment, let us be completely honest, most early stage stem cell investors have lost their shirts. We are now more than twenty years removed from the earliest commercial stem cell companies that were founded in the late 1980's, went public in the late 1990's and who were once seen as an exciting investment opportunity, but ended up being a huge disappointment. 
So, should investors still be interested in regenerative medicine? After all, stem cells have largely produced failures and unregulated stem cell clinics marketing unproven therapies are taking over. The answer is a resounding yes, but the dot-com like era of regenerative medicine, which led investors to pour money into anything and anyone marketing a cell therapy is over. Investors will need to look at companies solving issues with stem cells or those taking a completely new approach.
One company that is looking to address many of the issues with stem cell therapies, as well as developing another approach to regenerative medicine is Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: ENDV). On the stem cell front, ENDV is using its Time Varying Electromagnetic Fields (TVEMF) technology, originally developed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to expand and activate stem cells to produce more biologically potent cell therapies. However, more importantly, ENDV is developing a non-invasive medical device that would render many of the cell therapies currently under development obsolete. These devices, called Electroceuticals, harness the electrical signals that our cells and nerves use to control the immune and regenerative response to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases. ENDV is developing this exciting technology for treating and preventing heart failure following a heart attack, to treat chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Another small biotech company like ENDV working on electric treatments for diseases is Pulse Biosciences (NASDAQ:   PLSE), whose Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) technology uses nano second electric pulses to illicit an immune response for the treatment of cancer. PLSE recently announced the treatment of its first patient in a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its novel NPS technology for seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions. SK is one of the most common types of skin lesions, affecting more than 80 million patients in the United States. Additionally, PLSE announced that it will host its quarterly investor conference call on July 27, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. PDT / 4:30 p.m. EDT. The company will provide an update on the clinical advancement of the PulseTx[TM] System, including progress of the clinical study evaluating NPS for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis (SK), as well as the status of the 510(k) submission from earlier this year.  
Another company seeking to address past pitfalls of stem cell therapies is Pluristem Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    PSTI) is a developer of placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of multiple ischemic, inflammatory and hematologic conditions. Pluristem's products include PLX-PAD and PLX R18. The Company's PLX cells are adherent stromal cells (ASCs) that are expanded using a three dimensional (3D) process. The system utilizes a synthetic scaffold to create an artificial 3D environment where placental-derived stromal cells can grow. This process allows the cells to be expanded rapidly while remaining healthy and potent cells that can secrete therapeutic biomolecules. The Company's PLX products are administered using a standard needle and syringe. PSTI recently announced that Austria's regulatory health agency, the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), had cleared Pluristem to begin enrollment in Austria for its pivotal Phase III trial of PLX-PAD cells to treat critical limb ischemia.
In other stem cell news:
Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CYTX) recently announced that its STAR study assessing its Habeo Cell Therapy for the treatment of Scleroderma had failed to meet its primary endpoint at week 24 nor any of its secondary endpoints at week 24 or week 48. On the other hand, CYTX stated that there were 'clinically meaningful' improvements in both the primary and secondary endpoints of both hand function and scleroderma-associated functional disability compared to placebo in a subgroup of patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, a more severe form of the disease. The company has stated that it will continue it analysis of the data before determining its next steps.
Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CAPR) a biotechnology company developing biological therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other rare diseases, following news that Janssen Biotech, Inc. had decided not to exercise its option to exclusively license Capricor's lead candidate CAP-1002 for the development and commercialization in the field of cardiology, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to CAP-1002, Capricor's development candidate for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a debilitating genetic disorder characterized by progressive weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal, heart, and respiratory muscles. The Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, as well as the Orphan Drug Designation previously granted to CAP-1002 by the FDA, covers the broad treatment of DMD. Upon receiving market approval for CAP-1002 by the FDA, Capricor would be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher.

U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. Key Developments

U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. to Focus on and Expand in Clinic Therapies
Jun 19 17
U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. announced an aggressive plan to expand an additional 12 stem cell treatment centers and clinics in the US. U.S. Stem Cell has been in discussions with the FDA regarding Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) Designation for the Myocell product and at this time, the company has decided not to further invest in RMAT Designation and instead invest and focus on in-clinic therapies for patients. According to the 21st Century Cures Act, within one year of enactment, the FDA must issue draft guidance clarifying how the FDA will evaluate devices used in the recovery, isolation, or delivery of regenerative advanced therapies. Until this guidance document is published, it is unclear how this regulation will affect the MyoCell program. Until then, U.S. Stem Cell will focus on opening new clinics around the country to better serve patients in need.

Murphy, Jr., M.D. 90 Director, Chairman of the Board   Mark P. Borman  59  Director   Gregory Knutson 59 Director   Kristen Comella  37 DirectorChief Scientific Officer   Sheldon T. Anderson 63 Director                            About U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. US Stem Cell, Inc. (formerly Bioheart, Inc.) is an emerging enterprise in the regenerative medicine / cellular therapy industry. We are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of cell based therapeutics that prevent, treat or cure disease by repairing and replacing damaged or aged tissue, cells and organs and restoring their normal function. We believe that regenerative medicine / cellular therapeutics will play a large role in positively changing the natural history of diseases ultimately, we contend, lessening patient burdens as well as reducing the associated economic impact disease imposes upon modern society.    Business Strategy  Our principal objective is to become a leading regenerative medicine company that discovers, develops and commercializes novel, autologous cell therapies, and related devices, for the treatment and improved care of patients suffering from chronic and acute heart damage as well as lower limb ischemia. Our secondary objective is the discovery, development and commercialization of autologous cell therapies for the treatment of degenerative diseases.  The number of heart failure patients is expected to increase from 25 million worldwide today to over 50 million in five years. Our focus is on serving these patients. To achieve our primary objective, we plan to pursue the following strategies:  - Obtain initial regulatory approval of MyoCell and/or MyoCell SDF-1 by targeting patients with severe heart damage.  - Continue existing studies with adipose derived stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells.  - Continue to develop our pipeline of cell-based therapies and related devices for the treatment of chronic and acute heart damage.  - Develop our sales and marketing capabilities.  - Continue to refine our MyoCell and MyoCell SDF-1 cell culturing processes. - Expand and enhance our intellectual property rights.  - License, acquire and/or develop complementary products and technologies.    	               Sunrise, FL – April 10, 2017 – U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. (USRM), a Florida corporation and leader in novel regenerative medicine solutions and physician-based stem cell therapies for human and animal patients, has received reactivation status of the MARVEL phase II/III trial. Following the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act, U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. has applied to the FDA for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) Designation for the MyoCell product as part of the MARVEL trial.  Our trial had previously been placed on “Inactive Status” as patients were not actively being enrolled.  We placed a request to the FDA to reactivate the protocol and consider the therapy for RMAT designation.  We have recently heard from the FDA who has notified us that the protocol has been placed on “Reactivation Status” after reviewing details on the protocol and data collected on patients to date.  The FDA has also notified us that they are still reviewing our submission for RMAT.  Thanks to the REGROW component of the Cures Act, The FDA will grant RMAT designation for a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrates preliminary clinical evidence that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a disease.  We believe that our MyoCell product meets these requirements as we have demonstrated clinical efficacy in both preclinical and clinical studies including our most recent MARVEL trial publication (review full publication here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982657).  If RMAT designation is granted, this could expedite the approval process with the FDA. More information on the FDA’s new RMAT Designation can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm537670.htm   	               USRM - Daily Candlesticks

Neural stem cells linked to maintenance of youth ars_ab.settitle(1139073)






28 July 2017, 03:55 | Melissa Porter

There is hope that this breakthrough will pave the way for new strategies that delay or prevent diseases related to the aging process. So, while figuring out more precisely what these cells are doing, the end result from that won't be a formula for youth. The details of the findings were recently published in Nature.The hypothalamus was always known to regulate important bodily functions including growth, development, reproduction and metabolism. The research was conducted in the Bronx's Albert Einstein College of Medicine.These results are strongly suggestive that stem cells in the hypothalamus play a key role in modulating the aging process.Now, in a follow-up study, the researchers think they've pinpointed the particular cells in the hypothalamus that matter here: neural stem cells, which serve to generate replacements for dead and damaged cells.In what David Sinclair, who studies aging at Harvard Medical School and who was not involved in the work, calls a "Herculean effort", the researchers "discovered that stem cells in the hypothalamus of the mouse play a role in overall health and life span", he tells The Scientist. We need to be aware that this process in multi layered and that everything from diet to hormones going to affect our rate of aging. It was also determined the effects of the loss can be reversed.This lead to questions about whether injecting new stem cells could slow or reverse ageing, and it did.

LP (NYSE:KKR) Price Target Raised to $27.00 at Oppenheimer Holdings, Inc

Initially, they had to modify the stem cells, to initiate an anti-inflammatory pathway in the mice. "By old age - about two years of age in mice - most of those cells were gone", says Dr. Cai. This is several months ahead of the point when the typical signs of aging begin to manifest.To test the effects of the exosomes alone on aging, the researchers purified the vesicles from cultured hypothalamic neural stem cells and transplanted them into middle-aged mice, finding that the exosome-treated mice aged more slowly than vehicle-treated controls.According to him, if the stem cells are destroyed, the aging of the mice gets faster. The disruption dramatically accelerated the aging process compared to mice in the control group. Mice with ablated hypothalamic stem cells also died earlier than control mice.In the future, scientists could be capable of editing our brains to help us live longer. Both groups exhibited a slowing or complete reversal of aging measures. This is a normal aging process where the neural stem cells that produce key factors start dropping in numbers. In the hypothalamic neural stem cells, the researchers detected exosomes-secreted vesicles that can contain RNA and proteins-containing a variety of miRNAs, short RNA molecules that inhibit the expression of targeted genes.The next step was to inject hypothalamus stem cells into the brains of mice whose own supply of the cells had been destroyed, as well as "normal" old mice.To see if an opposite effect was also possible - in other words, whether stocking up on neural stem cells could produce youthful vigour and longevity - the team injected hypothalamic stem cells taken from newborn mice into the brains of two groups of mice.

MyoCell
U.S. Stem Cell’s lead product candidate is MyoCell®, a muscle stem cell therapy that is intended to improve cardiac function months or even years after a patient has suffered severe heart damage due to a heart attack. The procedure involves a physician removing a small amount of muscle from the patient’s thigh. From this muscle specimen, muscle stem cells (also called myoblasts) are then isolated, expanded using U.S. Stem Cell’s proprietary cell-culturing process, and injected directly into the scar tissue of the patient’s heart. The cells are delivered by an endoventricular needle-injection catheter during a minimally invasive procedure performed by an interventional cardiologist or vascular surgeon. The muscle stem cells populate the regions of scar tissue and are intended to improve cardiac function by helping the heart muscle beat more efficiently.
The results of our Clinical Trial Marvel Part 1 were published in the American Heart Journal, the prominent peer reviewed medical journal. When compared with placebo, myoblast therapy was associated with sustained (six months) improvements in six minute walk distance of >90 meters, a clinically meaningful improvement. For congestive heart failure patients, this translates into returning to a more active lifestyle and a better quality of life.
Proposed Use
Autologous muscle stem cell therapy for the treatment of severe heart damage in heart failure patients
Status/Phase
Phase I, Phase I/II and Phase II trials completed. Phase II/III underway












MyoCell SDF-1
MyoCell SDF-1 has received approval from the FDA to begin human clinical trials and is intended to be an improvement to MyoCell. The myoblast cells to be injected are gene-modified prior to injection by an adenovirus vector so that they will release extra quantities of stromal derived factor – 1 or SDF-1 protein. Following injury which results in inadequate blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack, the human body naturally increases the level of SDF-1 protein in the heart. By modifying the myoblasts to express SDF-1 prior to injection, the levels of SDF proteins in the heart can be increased. The presence of additional quantities of SDF-1 protein released by the myoblasts may stimulate the recruitment of the patient’s existing stem cells to the cell transplanted area and, thereafter, the recruited stem cells will assist in the tissue repair and blood vessel formation process. In preclinical studies, MyoCell SDF-1 provided a 54 percent improvement of heart function compared to 27 percent for the original MyoCell composition, while the placebo control treated animals declined by 10 percent. The preclinical studies also demonstrated that this product candidate can enhance blood vessel formation in damaged hearts.
Proposed Use
Autologous cell therapy treatment for severe chronic damage in the heart; cells modified to express angiogenic proteins.
Status/Phase
IND application approved July 2009












AdipoCell
Adipose (fat) tissue is readily available and has been shown to be rich in microvascular, myogenic and angiogenic cells. In collaboration with the Regenerative Medicine Institute in Tijuana, Mexico, congestive heart failure patients are being treated in a Phase I/II trial at Hospital Angeles Tijuana. These patients have demonstrated on average an absolute improvement of 13 percentage points in ejection fraction and an increase of 100 meters in their six minute walk distance.
U.S. Stem Cell has recently applied to the FDA to begin trials using adipose derived stem cells or AdipoCell™ in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The therapy involves the use of stem cells derived from the patient’s own fat (adipose tissue) obtained using liposuction. Transplantation of AdipoCell™ is accomplished through endocardial implantations with an injection catheter.

STEM CELL SUPPLEMENTS
Stem cells are cells with the ability to divide for indefinite periods in culture and to give rise to specialized cells. 
Stem Cell Supplements are developed based on the merits of stem cells and they are applied for degenerative diseases treatments and to stimulate the formation of all the different tissues of the body: muscle, cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone, blood,nerve, organs, etc. Stem Cell Supplements bring essential health & antiaging benefits by providing necessary elements to the body to improve cellular rejuvenation, organ regeneration and tissue healing.

HOW DOES STEM CELL THERAPY PLUS WORK?
Stem Cell Therapy Plus uses the same principle as traditional stem cell therapy but with much less cost, less risk, yet similar or more effectiveness. Stem Cell Therapy Plus starts with the selection of specific organ cells from an animal fetus (unborn young) bred specifically for this purpose. Many years of experience have shown that sheep are the best donor animals because they are vital, hardy animals with the best immune systems and natural disease resistance. Sheep proteins are particularly compatible with the human body and trigger no immune reactions. In Stem Cell Therapy Plus, these vigorous young stem cells, with their vital life force still active, are ingested into a human host via high-tech softgel bio-active Stem Cell PE Capsules. 
Since stem cells have NO antigens, they are NOT recognized as foreign by the host body. According to Dr. Niehans’ proven theory, they circulate from  the site of ingestion (small intestines) until they recognize and congregate at the human counterpart of the organ from which they were taken – pancreas cells go to the pancreas, brain cells go to the brain, nerves cells go to the nerves, cartilage cells go to the cartilages, heart cells go to the heart, etc. These young stem cells, which are functionally organ specific but not species specific, imprint their vigor upon old, tired, and degenerating cells, stimulating them to function with renewed efficiency. The organ itself then retains its vigor and vitality.
In addition to effectively stimulate the cells of specific organ systems, these new and energetic stem cells act quickly to revitalize the body immune system & defense mechanisms. When damage occurs to the cells that make up the various tissues and organs involved in the immune systems (either through the ageing process or from environmental poisons), the body becomes defenseless against both external invasion and internal degeneration. Damage to specific organs and immune system may be reversed through revitalization & regeneration with Stem Cell Therapy Plus. Anecdotal evidence shows that through the usage of Stem Cell Therapy Plus, improvements can be seen in the case of some degenerative diseases as aforementioned.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                       At Surgenex®, we’re focused on making changing tomorrow a reality. Click here to learn more about Surgenex® mission statment 


SURGENEX® Capability
SURGENEX® is the producer and distributor of the highest quality amniotic membrane tissue allograft in the industry. Amniotic Tissue is used for a wide variety of clinical applications including: 



 Orthopedics
 Sports Medicine
 Wound Care




 Podiatry
 Pain Management



SURGENEX® has developed innovative processes and safety protocols, which deliver the highest cellular tissue viability and safety standards. With these safety and quality standards, SURGENEX® will become the leader of amniotic membrane tissue allografts in the field of regenerative medicine.
The SURGENEX® proprietary Excellion® process preserves the integrity of the amnion tissue, achieving greater clinical outcomes. This unique process yields high concentrations of tissue, growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and is chorion free. Our products contain these extracellular proteins and molecules which induce soft tissue healing, reduce scar tissue, and promote tissue regeneration.
Our placenta recovery processes start where life begins. Qualified mothers donate their placenta for medical treatments and research. These donors are selected through a strict screening process which includes an extensive patient questionnaire, serological testing, and a medical staff interview to ensure donor eligibility. The Excellion® process honors these donations by meticulously collecting the amniotic membrane and carefully removing unwanted tissues such as the chorion. This highly technical process produces the highest cellular tissue viability and the best amniotic tissue allograft in the industry.







We Deliver Results
Our Company has developed innovative processes and safety protocols, which deliver the highest cellular viability and safety standards.  With these safety and quality standards, SURGENEX® is poised to become the leader of amniotic membrane allografts in the field of regenerative medicine.







Our products
SurForce® Amniotic Tissue Allograft 



Product SurForce® Goto SurForce Website 
SurForce® is a minimally manipulated, morselized flowable amniotic membrane tissue allograft designed to be the best product on the market today. It is an injectable allograft for homologous use only that allows the physician freedom to make precise applications. 
SurForce® is thoroughly tested for safety in clinical procedures. Our donor serology test panel is the most extensive in the industry, testing for several potential pathogens that could be missed by less extensive testing observed in competitive industry products. SURGENEX® conducts two simultaneous 14-day bacterial/fungal tests performed by one internal and one third party lab, to confirm our products are free of bacterial and fungal contaminants. These two safety barriers verify that SurForce® is the cleanest and safest amniotic membrane tissue allograft product on the market.

Clinical Trials on Stem-Kine
1. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells: a new approach to anti-aging medicine?
Journal of Translational Medicine 2009, 7:106. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KWH, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel A, Murphy MP, Smith L, Alexandrescu DT, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as numerous age-related conditions. The possibility of preserving or even rejuvenating endothelial function offers a potent means of preventing/treating some of the most fearful aspects of aging such as loss of mental, cardiovascular, and sexual function. Endothelial precursor cells (EPC) provide a continual source of replenishment for damaged or senescent blood vessels. In this review we discuss the biological relevance of circulating EPC in a variety of pathologies in order to build the case that these cells act as an endogenous mechanism of regeneration. Factors controlling EPC mobilization, migration, and function, as well as therapeutic interventions based on mobilization of EPC will be reviewed. We conclude by discussing several clinically-relevant approaches to EPC mobilization and provide preliminary data on a food supplement, Stem-Kine, which enhanced EPC mobilization in human subjects…

2. Nutraceutical augmentation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in human subjects
Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, Apr 8;8:34. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KW, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel AN, Murphy MP, Smith L, Ramos F, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: The medical significance of circulating endothelial or hematopoietic progenitors is becoming increasing recognized. While therapeutic augmentation of circulating progenitor cells using G-CSF has resulted in promising preclinical and early clinical data for several degenerative conditions, this approach is limited by cost and inability to perform chronic administration. Stem-Kine is a food supplement that was previously reported to augment circulating EPC in a pilot study. Here we report a trial in 18 healthy volunteers administered Stem-Kine twice daily for a 2 week period. Significant increases in circulating CD133 and CD34 cells were observed at days 1, 2, 7, and 14 subsequent to initiation of administration, which correlated with increased hematopoietic progenitors as detected by the HALO assay…

Clinical Trials on Stem-Kine
1. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells: a new approach to anti-aging medicine?
Journal of Translational Medicine 2009, 7:106. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KWH, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel A, Murphy MP, Smith L, Alexandrescu DT, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as numerous age-related conditions. The possibility of preserving or even rejuvenating endothelial function offers a potent means of preventing/treating some of the most fearful aspects of aging such as loss of mental, cardiovascular, and sexual function. Endothelial precursor cells (EPC) provide a continual source of replenishment for damaged or senescent blood vessels. In this review we discuss the biological relevance of circulating EPC in a variety of pathologies in order to build the case that these cells act as an endogenous mechanism of regeneration. Factors controlling EPC mobilization, migration, and function, as well as therapeutic interventions based on mobilization of EPC will be reviewed. We conclude by discussing several clinically-relevant approaches to EPC mobilization and provide preliminary data on a food supplement, Stem-Kine, which enhanced EPC mobilization in human subjects…

2. Nutraceutical augmentation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in human subjects
Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, Apr 8;8:34. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KW, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel AN, Murphy MP, Smith L, Ramos F, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: The medical significance of circulating endothelial or hematopoietic progenitors is becoming increasing recognized. While therapeutic augmentation of circulating progenitor cells using G-CSF has resulted in promising preclinical and early clinical data for several degenerative conditions, this approach is limited by cost and inability to perform chronic administration. Stem-Kine is a food supplement that was previously reported to augment circulating EPC in a pilot study. Here we report a trial in 18 healthy volunteers administered Stem-Kine twice daily for a 2 week period. Significant increases in circulating CD133 and CD34 cells were observed at days 1, 2, 7, and 14 subsequent to initiation of administration, which correlated with increased hematopoietic progenitors as detected by the HALO assay…

How Does it Work?
Stem-Kine’s powerful ingredients contain a proprietary, heat-treated extract of Lactobacillus Fermentum and the powerful antioxidants astragalus root, goji berry, and green tea. This cell wall extract gives Stem-Kine its “fertilizer effect” and releases stem cells into the bloodstream & protects those cells from oxidative stress. Supplemental ingredients include beta-1,3-glucan, vitamin D3, and ellagic acid to further protect stem cells from oxidative stress.*†
  Lactobacillus Fermentum
Containing patented and patent-pending fermented blends of astragalus root, goji berry, and green tea, our proprietary ingredient nourishes the bone marrow to release more stem cells into the blood stream. Once these stem cells are in circulation, they can hone to sources of injury within the body and begin the repair process.*†
  Beta 1,3 Glucan
A natural immune booster, beta glucans have been shown in multiple research studies to trigger a cascade of events that help regulate the immune system, making it stronger and more efficient. Beta glucans are also extremely important for heart health. A recent research study showed that people who ingested more beta glucans, had a significantly greater reduction of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL).*†
  Ellagic Acid
Sourced from nature’s powerful antioxidant, pomegranate, ellagic acid harbors a powerful chemoprotective effect by reducing oxidative stress. This ingredient helps to protect your stem cells from free radicals.*†
  Vitamin D3
For more than a century, scientists have recognized that Vitamin D3 is involved in bone health. Not only that, it is paramount in immune support & low levels of Vitamin D3 are linked to depression, back pain, cancer, impaired immunity, and much more.*†

Clinical Trial #1


Clinical Trial #2




Supplementation with Stem-Kine has been shown to result in a double the amount increase in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)!1*
*Results not necessarily typical.  Individual results may vary.



Stem-Kine increased the amount of CD-133 hematopoietic stem cells significantly over control levels!2*











How to take?

  Take 2-4 capsules per day as part of a healthy diet.  Can be taken with or without food.
  Loading dose = 2 servings AM/PM (4 capsules daily)
  Maintenance dose = 1 servings AM (2 capsules daily)

Overview:
We suggest taking a double dose for the first bottle (4 capsules daily) to optimize the release of stem cells over the first 2-week period of time.  Continuing with a maintenance dose of 2 capsules/day will help to nourish these stem cells and protect them from oxidative stress.  Responses to Stem-Kine may differ, and some individuals may want to continue taking 4 capsules daily to maintain optimal effects.  As with any new supplement, it is advised to consult your physician before using. If you are using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines, are unaware of your current medical condition, or have any pre-existing medical condition(s), consult with your physician before using this product. There are no known side effects from taking Stem-Kine.

Working Closely with FDA to Obtain Regenerative Advanced Therapy DesignationAccesswireMarch 30, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSUNRISE, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 30, 2017 / U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. (USCC) (USRM), a Florida corporation and leader in novel regenerative medicine solutions and physician-based stem cell therapies for human and animal patients, has applied for Regenerative Advanced Therapy (RAT) designation from the FDA.Following the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act, U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. has applied to the FDA for RAT Designation. We have recently heard from the FDA, who has requested additional information regarding the MARVEL Phase II/III trial. We have provided all requested information to the FDA and are hopeful that the FDA will continue their expeditious review of our MyoCell product. Thanks to the REGROW component of the Cures Act, the FDA will grant RAT designation for a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease and demonstrates preliminary clinical evidence that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a disease. We believe that our MyoCell product meets these requirements, as we have demonstrated clinical efficacy in both preclinical and clinical studies, including our most recent MARVEL trial publication (review full publication here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982657). If RAT designation is granted, this could expedite the approval process with the FDA.More information on the FDA's new RAT Designation can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm537670.htm.About U.S. Stem Cell, Inc.US Stem Cell, Inc. (formerly Bioheart, Inc.) is an emerging enterprise in the regenerative medicine / cellular therapy industry. We are focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of cell based therapeutics that prevent, treat, or cure disease by repairing and replacing damaged or aged tissue, cells, and organs and restoring their normal function. We believe that regenerative medicine / cellular therapeutics will play a large role in positively changing the natural history of diseases, ultimately, we contend, lessening patient burdens, as well as reducing the associated economic impact disease imposes upon modern society.Our business, which includes three operating divisions (US Stem Cell Training, Vetbiologics, and US Stem Cell Clinic), includes the development of proprietary cell therapy products, as well as revenue generating physician and patient based regenerative medicine / cell therapy training services, cell collection and cell storage services, the sale of cell collection and treatment kits for humans and animals, and the operation of a cell therapy clinic. Management maintains that revenues and their associated cash in-flows generated from our businesses will, over time, provide funds to support our clinical development activities as they do today for our general business operations. We believe the combination of our own therapeutics pipeline combined with our revenue generating capabilities provides the Company with a unique opportunity for growth and a pathway to profitability.Forward-Looking Statements: Except for historical matters contained herein, statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements.
