Today, SKUPOS Inc., a two-sided retail distribution software company, specializing in the convenience store industry, announced that they have raised $2.41M in seed funding. The funds will be used to continue product development to meet industry demand. Dynamo Fund led the round with Toba Capital. The company received investment in one previous round as well, the first in July of 2016 from industry angel investors and technology veterans in San Francisco.'Dynamo is honored and excited to support and partner with the team at SKUPOS to revolutionize the supply chain for the $700B c-store industry.' said Santosh Sankar, Director at Dynamo. 'SKUPOS is revolutionizing the industry by automating key functions and upholding supply chain transparency. It's integrated solution provides real time inventory, automated purchasing, and operational intelligence to c-store operators and their distributor partners.'The company, which currently has launched in over 200 stores, is a data driven two-sided inventory management system allowing convenience stores to automate inventory management and ordering, while providing distributors and brands with real-time inventory levels in their accounts, as well as the ability to quickly generate re-orders. Stores are currently saving over 65% of the time spent on manual processes, while distributors are boosting sales and operational efficiencies when converting to SKUPOS.'At Toba, we look for teams working on exactly these kinds of thorny, grimy, often unseen but incredibly crucial problems. That's why we're thrilled to be backing SKUPOS and the powerful, intuitive technology they've developed to modernize convenience store operations nationwide,' said Patrick Mathieson, Partner at Toba Capital.The company's patent pending technology integrates with a convenience store's existing pointof-sale system, enabling real-time inventory management, accessible from any device. The conversion of manual processes to automation has enabled distributors to save money and increase efficiencies throughout the order capture process.Jake Bolling, co-founder of SKUPOS, believes the 'convenience store industry is the cornerstone of the American retail economy, but has lacked a platform that is agnostic both to the retailer, as well as distributor. Custom, in-house solutions negate scalability across multiple retailers and distributors, creating inefficiencies. We're harnessing the data that has been locked up throughout the industry for decades, providing value to both sides of the market through a single platform.'SKUPOS is currently accepting beta customers, both convenience stores and distributors. The company was founded in April 2016 by Jake Bolling, Michael Glassman, and Linh Nguyen. It launched early fall in 2016, and is based in San Francisco.

Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.  It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.


Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.


Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ( "Notice" ) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 345 Vermont Street, San Francisco , California 94103.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.


Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ( "AAA" ), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ( "ADR Provider" ) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ( "Arbitration Rules" ) governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.


Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.  If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.


Time Limits.  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.


Authority of Arbitrator.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.


Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.


Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.


Confidentiality.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.


Severability.  If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.


Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.


Survival of Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.


Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.


Emergency Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.


Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.


Courts.  In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California, for such purpose.




Export. The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.


Disclosures.  Company is located at the address in Section 8.8. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\


Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.


Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation".  If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.

December 22, 2016SAN FRANCISCO -- SKUPOS Inc., a retail distribution software company specializing in the convenience-store industry, announced that it has raised $2.41 million in seed funding.SKUPOS automates key functions and upholds supply-chain transparency. The integrated solution provides real-time inventory, automated purchasing and operational intelligence to c-store operators and their distributor partners. It is a data-driven, two-sided inventory management system allowing c-stores to automate inventory management and ordering, while providing distributors and brands with real-time inventory levels in their accounts, as well as the ability to quickly generate reorders.The patent pending technology integrates with a c-store’s existing point-of-sale (POS) system, enabling real-time inventory management accessible from any device. The conversion of manual processes to automation has enabled distributors to save money and increase efficiencies throughout the order capture process, the company said.The company said it is accepting beta customers, both convenience stores and distributors. The funds will be used to continue product development.Dynamo Fund led the round with Toba Capital. The company also received investment in one previous round, the first in July 2016 from industry angel investors and technology veterans in San Francisco.The company said more than 200 stores have implemented the software.Jake Bolling, co-founder of SKUPOS, said he believes the “convenience-store industry is the cornerstone of the American retail economy, but has lacked a platform that is agnostic both to the retailer, as well as distributor. Custom, in-house solutions negate scalability across multiple retailers and distributors, creating inefficiencies. We’re harnessing the data that has been locked up throughout the industry for decades, providing value to both sides of the market through a single platform.”Bolling founded the San Francisco-based company in April 2016 with Michael Glassman and Linh Nguyen.

San Francisco-based Skupos, a provider of retail distribution software for the convenience store industry, has raised $2.41 million in seed funding. Dynamo Fund led the round with participation from Toba Capital.
PRESS RELEASE
San Francisco, CA: Today, SKUPOS Inc., a two-sided retail distribution software company, specializing in the convenience store industry, announced that they have raised $2.41M in seed funding. The funds will be used to continue product development to meet industry demand. Dynamo Fund led the round with Toba Capital. The company received investment in one previous round as well, the first in July of 2016 from industry angel investors and technology veterans in San Francisco.
“Dynamo is honored and excited to support and partner with the team at SKUPOS to revolutionize the supply chain for the $700B c-store industry.” said Santosh Sankar, Director at Dynamo. “SKUPOS is revolutionizing the industry by automating key functions and upholding supply chain transparency. It’s integrated solution provides real time inventory, automated purchasing, and operational intelligence to c-store operators and their distributor partners.”
The company, which currently has launched in over 200 stores, is a data driven two-sided inventory management system allowing convenience stores to automate inventory management and ordering, while providing distributors and brands with real-time inventory levels in their accounts, as well as the ability to quickly generate re-orders. Stores are currently saving over 65% of the time spent on manual processes, while distributors are boosting sales and operational efficiencies when converting to SKUPOS. 





“At Toba, we look for teams working on exactly these kinds of thorny, grimy, often unseen but incredibly crucial problems. That’s why we’re thrilled to be backing SKUPOS and the powerful, intuitive technology they’ve developed to modernize convenience store operations nationwide,” said Patrick Mathieson, Partner at Toba Capital.
The company’s patent pending technology integrates with a convenience store’s existing pointof-sale system, enabling real-time inventory management, accessible from any device. The conversion of manual processes to automation has enabled distributors to save money and increase efficiencies throughout the order capture process.
Jake Bolling, co-founder of SKUPOS, believes the “convenience store industry is the cornerstone of the American retail economy, but has lacked a platform that is agnostic both to the retailer, as well as distributor. Custom, in-house solutions negate scalability across multiple retailers and distributors, creating inefficiencies. We’re harnessing the data that has been locked up throughout the industry for decades, providing value to both sides of the market through a single platform.”
SKUPOS is currently accepting beta customers, both convenience stores and distributors. The company was founded in April 2016 by Jake Bolling, Michael Glassman, and Linh Nguyen. It launched early fall in 2016, and is based in San Francisco.

SKUPOS Scores $2.41 Million in Seed Funding

 




SAN FRANCISCO — SKUPOS Inc., a retail distribution software company specializing in the convenience-store industry, announced that it has raised $2.41 million in seed funding.
SKUPOS automates key functions and upholds supply-chain transparency. The integrated solution provides real-time inventory, automated purchasing and operational intelligence to c-store operators and their distributor partners. It is a data-driven, two-sided inventory management system allowing c-stores to automate inventory management and ordering, while providing distributors and brands with real-time inventory levels in their accounts, as well as the ability to quickly generate reorders.
The patent pending technology integrates with a c-store’s existing point-of-sale (POS) system, enabling real-time inventory management accessible from any device.
The conversion of manual processes to automation has enabled distributors to save money and increase efficiencies throughout the order capture process, the company said.
The company said it is accepting beta customers, both convenience stores and distributors. The funds will be used to continue product development.
Dynamo Fund led the round with Toba Capital. The company also received investment in one previous round, the first in July 2016 from industry angel investors and technology veterans in San Francisco.
The company said more than 200 stores have implemented the software.
Jake Bolling, co-founder of SKUPOS, said he believes the “convenience-store industry is the cornerstone of the American retail economy, but has lacked a platform that is agnostic both to the retailer, as well as distributor. Custom, in-house solutions negate scalability across multiple retailers and distributors, creating inefficiencies. We’re harnessing the data that has been locked up throughout the industry for decades, providing value to both sides of the market through a single platform.”
Bolling founded the San Francisco-based company in April 2016 with Michael Glassman and Linh Nguyen. It launched in early fall 2016.
