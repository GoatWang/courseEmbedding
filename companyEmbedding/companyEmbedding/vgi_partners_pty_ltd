About VGI Partners
VGI Partners is a high conviction global equity manager. VGI manages capital for high net worth individuals, family offices and endowment funds. VGI’s Investment Team is based in Sydney and New York.
At VGI, we focus on businesses that we understand and where we believe we possess insights not appreciated by the wider investment industry. Long term business success is achieved through operating where you have a competitive advantage. In the business of investing, competitive advantage is obtained through superior knowledge and analysis.
VGI believes that its long term investment horizon provides a competitive advantage in an investment world which is increasingly focused on the short term.
VGI invests in a relatively small number of high quality businesses. VGI believes that diversification preserves wealth, while concentration builds wealth. This is complemented with opportunistic short selling of low quality businesses that are typically structurally challenged, poorly managed and materially overvalued.
Alignment of Interests
“An example of a really responsible system is the system the Romans used when they built an arch. The guy who created the arch stood under it as the scaffolding was removed. It’s like packing your own parachute.” – Charles T. Munger, Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, 1993
Alignment of interests is a critical aspect of VGI’s business model and culture. This is achieved through the following:

VGI’s principals invest a material proportion of their net worth in VGI, the various VGI Partners Funds and/or an account managed by VGI;
VGI’s Investment Team is incentivised according to fund performance, with all staff encouraged to re-invest any discretionary bonuses into the Fund; and
VGI staff, including principals, do not purchase securities outside of the Fund. The VGI Investment Team focuses all of its time and energy on managing clients’ money.

VGI’s Investment Philosophy
Capital preservation – We place a great deal of importance on assessing downside risk. We attempt to know as much about our portfolio companies as we can and believe that this will enable us to prevent permanent loss of capital. Risk comes from not properly understanding your investments.
Superior long term compound growth – We aim to produce superior long term compound growth over time by seeking out and investing in what we believe to be some of the best businesses in the world. Great businesses purchased with a sufficient ‘margin of safety’ will provide superior long term returns.
Concentration – We aim to invest in a relatively small number of high quality stocks (with about 10 to 15 core positions at any one time). We aim to be concentrated enough in our best ideas so as not to dilute our overall returns but hold enough positions in order to provide an appropriate level of diversification. Concentrating capital in high quality businesses builds wealth.
Our strategy is to buy wonderful businesses for the long term in an effort to defer tax, minimise frictional costs and maximise our long term returns. If a business performs well, the stock price will eventually follow.
We aim to hold cash when we feel that no ‘margin of safety’ exists. We demonstrated this in 2008 by holding the majority of our capital in cash. By doing this we were able to protect our clients’ capital during one of the worst market collapses since the Great Depression.
We are often contrarian and strive to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. To have better performance than the crowd, you must do things differently to the crowd.
We aim to selectively short companies that we have identified to be structurally weak and believe are vulnerable to material price declines.
What does a great business look like?
The following are some of the qualities that we look for in a great business:

Simple and easy to understand business model. Never invest in any idea you can’t explain in relatively simple terms.
Dominant in its industry and has been through periods of recession and emerged stronger.
Superior returns on capital achieved through high margins and relatively low capital reinvestment requirements. This allows the business to distribute cashflow to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.
Sustainable competitive advantage protecting the business from competition and allowing management to increase prices above inflation without losing market share – these traits are often found in businesses that are natural monopolies or oligopolies in their industry.
Significant cashflow generation. Creates excess cash over and above the business’ annual capital requirements.
Strong balance sheet with sensible gearing levels.
High quality management with a proven track record of outstanding performance. Management should display honesty, intelligence and integrity.

J. P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc.


                  JPMorgan Investment Management's (JPMIM) investment approach is based on the premise that building an information advantage and capitalizing on it through active management is the key to investment success. The firm employs global fundamental research, quantitative valuation tools and bottom-up portfolio construction methods. Investment decisions are based on micro-valuation insights.JPMIM's investment approach focuses on identifying opportunities through in-house research that seeks to assess the fundamental value of securities. Active investment management, supported by JPMIM's research capabilities, is the driving force behind every portfolio. Research analysts evaluate the US market by sector, while globally-based portfolio managers and analysts cover the international capital markets. JPMIM integrates the skills of their research analysts with those of experienced portfolio managers and economists to leverage information and choose the most fundamentally attractive investments.Investments are managed by teams, with portfolio managers working closely with research analysts. Portfolio managers typically purchase first and second quintile stocks while underweighting third, fourth and fifth quintile stocks. Holdings are diversified with broad exposure without regard to industry sector or geographic region. JPMIM looks for the stocks and ADRs of US and non-US companies with leadership positions in specialty niches, long-life product cycles, competitive cost structures, diversified client bases and significant insider ownership.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
