Within the last five years, Mr. DeNero has served as a director of DataDirect Networks, Inc. and THQ, Inc.

 

Mr. DeNero has executive level experience in a broad range of industries, which demonstrates to our Board of Directors his ability to lead and provide strategic input on a wide range of issues. His extensive experience at McKinsey & Company, a respected consulting firm, provides our Board of Directors with valuable insights into corporate strategy and problem resolution. He has significant experience working in Japan and Europe in his positions with McKinsey & Company, which are two important geographic locations for our company. His financial skills and prior experience as a chief financial officer qualify him as an audit committee financial expert under SEC rules. We believe these experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills qualify him to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.
