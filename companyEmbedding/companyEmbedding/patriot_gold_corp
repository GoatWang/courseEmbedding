Company News
Patriot Gold Corp: Clarification and Retraction of Previously Issued Historical DisclosureOctober 7, 2015 Las Vegas, Nevada - Patriot Gold Corp. ("Patriot" or the "Company") (OTCQB:PGOL) announces that as a result of a review by the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC"), the Company is issuing this news release to retract certain historical disclosure pertaining to the Bruner Property, which, as previously filed in press releases and posted on the Company's website was not compliant with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101").  Bruner Property  On May 1, 2009 and September 12, 2012, the Company issued press releases in which a historical resource estimate pertaining to the Bruner Property did not comply with NI 43-101 as the Company did not disclose the source and date of such statement, the relevance and reliability of the historical estimate, the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to prepare the historical estimate, an explanation of the differences between the category of resource stated and current accepted categories of mineral resources and disclosure on what work needs to be done to upgrade or verify the historical estimate as a current mineral reserve or mineral resource, all as required by section 2.4 of NI 43-101.  After further review of the source information, the Company is unable to re-state the estimate in compliance with NI 43-101 requirements; consequently, the Company retracts the estimate described herein in its entirety. The Company advises and cautions readers that the retracted disclosure may continue to be found in the public domain.  Robert Coale is the Qualified Person (as defined by NI 43-101) who has reviewed and approved the technical information in this news release as it relates to the Bruner Property.   Disclaimer: This announcement may contain forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that include, among others, limited operating history, limited access to operating capital, factors detailed in the accuracy of geological and geophysical results including drilling and assay reports; the ability to close the acquisition of mineral exploration properties, and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. More information is included in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may be accessed through the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov.

About Patriot Gold
A Gold and Silver Company
Patriot Gold Corp. (Stock Symbol: PGOL) is focused on developing its precious metals projects. The Moss Mine project, in which we own a 3% royalty, has achieved pilot production and is now moving toward commercial production. The Bruner gold project, in which we own a 2% royalty, although not yet in production, has delivered outstanding drill results and had a Preliminary Economic Assessment carried out. Our wholly-owned Vernal gold project and Windy Peak project are both early stage projects.
Our focus has been to develop gold and silver projects in the Southwest USA. We have limited our focus to this part of the world in order to eliminate the jurisdictional-risks associated with mining in foreign countries. We have also chosen to focus on the Southwest USA because it lends itself to year-round accessibility, has excellent mining infrastructure, offers a world-class highly-skilled workforce, and is known for its prolific deposits.
We started exploring in 2003 and shortly thereafter acquired the Moss Mine and Bruner projects. The Moss entered pilot production in 2013, we converted our interest to a 3% royalty in 2016, and the mine is now moving toward commercial production. The Bruner project has recently had a Prelimary Economic Assessment completed and quantified a substantial resource, and we converted our interest in the project to a 2% royalty in 2017. Our shareholders have taken a long-term perspective to develop and produce our gold and silver assets, and have now met with success. If you are interested in becoming a shareholder or partnering with us, we welcome you to contact us.

Overview

Vernal Gold Project




 



Overview
Patriot Gold Corp is focused on developing its Arizona and Nevada precious metals projects and assets. We have a royalty interest in the Moss Mine, a substantial Arizona-based gold and silver project which is now moving towards commercial production. We also have a royalty interest in the Bruner gold project, which although not yet in production, has delivered impressive assays, an updated resource, and a Preliminary Economic Assessment. Our Vernal gold and Windy Peak projects are still in their early stages.
The Moss Mine is located within Arizona's Oatman District, which has produced around 2 million ounces of gold, historically. The Bruner and Vernal gold projects are both located within Nevada's Walker Lane, which hosts numerous major deposits including the Goldfield (over 5 million ounces of post production and present reserves) and the Comstock (over 8 million ounces).

Patriot Gold Corp.: Bruner Gold Project Intersects 11.1 G/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters, Visible Gold ReportedHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 3 hrs 44 minsS&P Futures2,464.25-5.25 (-0.21%)Dow Futuresundefined (0)Nasdaq Futures5,908.25-10.50 (-0.18%)Patriot Gold Corp.: Bruner Gold Project Intersects 11.1 G/Tonne Over 4.6 Meters, Visible Gold ReportedMarketwiredJuly 28, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareLAS VEGAS, NEVADA--(Marketwired - Jul 28, 2014) -  Patriot Gold Corp. (PGOL) or ("Patriot Gold") (PGOL), a gold and silver exploration and production company, today provided more results from the reverse circulation (RC) drilling program at its Bruner gold project located in Nye County, Nevada.Key Highlights:RC drill hole B-1430 is the first drill hole intersecting the plane of the Penelas Vein structure (at 15 feet grading 0.324 oz/ton of gold) at historically significant mined depths with gold visibility observed during the drilling process.   Metallic screen assays are already underway to test the accuracy of the fire assay data.   Drill holes B-1433 and B-1434 were also drilled into the Penelas Vein structure at similar depths.   Additional drilling on the vein will be determined after all data have been fully evaluated and aligned with existing access requirements.  "As drilling continues to progress at the Bruner project site, we are pleased to report signs of visible gold at another historically significant area, the old Penelas Mine Zone and specifically around the intersection of the plane at the Penelas Vein structure," said Bob Coale, CEO of Patriot Gold. "We believe the Bruner project has delivered exceptional results thus far during this ongoing drill program and remain optimistic that more good news will follow, especially as further in-depth analysis is being conducted which will determine the next critical development steps towards capturing the full long-term potential value of this project for our stakeholders."RC Drill Hole B-1430Located approximately midway between the historic resource area and the new Penelas East discovery area, the old Penelas Mine Zone is where RC drill hole B-1430 intersected 15 feet (4.6 meters) grading 0.324 oz/ton Au (11.1 g/tonne Au) with a wider zone of 65 feet (19.8 meters) grading 0.095 opt Au (3.24 g/tonne Au). Preliminary results indicate that gold was visible in the cuttings during drilling at the Penelas Vein structure and when panned from the drill cuttings reject stream. Metallic screen assays are already in progress to test the accuracy of the fire assay data reported here.RC drill hole B-1430 is the first drill hole to intersect the plane of the Penelas Vein structure at historically mined depths. The Penelas Vein structure was the focus of historic mining between 1929 and 1941, producing approximately 100,000 tons of material grading 0.34 oz/ton Au and 2.5 oz/ton Ag. This material was then processed in a small 50 ton per day agitation leach cyanidation circuit. Recent samplings taken of the remaining tailings indicate possible extractions of 95% for gold and 60% for silver for the historic production.Mineralized intercept in drill hole B-1430 are as follows:  Hole ID From-To (ft) Thickness (ft/m) oz/ton Au g/tonne Au Est. True Width                 B-1430 625-690 65/19.8 0.095 3.24 22/6.7   Incl. 660-675 15/4.6 0.324 11.10 5.1/1.6  RC Drill Holes B-1433 & B-1434Drill holes B-1433 and B-1434 were also drilled into the Penelas Vein structure at similar depths with B-1433 intersecting the vein from 720-735 feet. Samples from this intercept are currently being further analyzed. Drill hole results for B-1434 suggest that the high-grade intercept, which penetrated old workings where the vein was projected, had been previously mined.Additional drilling plans on the vein will be determined after all the data have been fully evaluated and reconciled with access requirements.Additional Drill HolesAdditional drill holes drilled in the plane of the section of RC drill hole B-1430 were significantly higher up the dip of the Penelas Vein structure. These shallower holes intersected the vein, but with much thinner intersections of 5 feet (1.5 meters) or less, and were lower in grade, similar to upper levels of the old Penelas Mine workings.Mineralized intercepts for these drill holes are reported below:  Hole ID From-To (ft) Thickness (ft/m) oz/ton Au g/tonne Au Est.

Historic production from the Bruner property included about 100,000 ounces at an average grade of 0.56 opt gold.Patriot Gold's Option To Optionee/OperatorPatriot Gold owns 100% undivided rights, title and interest in the project which is subject to certain royalties and an earn-in option agreement for 70% interest. The earn-in optionee/operator, Canamex Resources Corp. (CSQ.V) (CNMXF), has the right to earn 70% interest in the Bruner project by spending $6 million over seven years and may earn an additional 5% by completing a bankable feasibility study for a total of 75% interest in the project. Subsequent to the optionee/operator earn-in, financing of the project will be on a proportional basis.About Patriot GoldPatriot Gold Corp. is a precious metals exploration and production company with the mission to discover and develop significant gold and silver assets.
