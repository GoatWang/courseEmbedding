August 04, 2014 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brady 
      Corporation (NYSE: BRC) (“Brady”), a world leader in identification 
      solutions, today announced the appointment of J. Michael Nauman as 
      President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, effective immediately.
    


      “Michael Nauman is known and respected as a hands-on leader who thrives 
      on attacking challenges, building customer relationships and driving 
      product innovation,” said Conrad Goodkind, the Lead Independent Director 
      of Brady’s Board. “His strong operational and financial background and 
      experience in managing and growing diverse products and businesses 
      throughout the world make him the ideal person to lead our business into 
      the future.”
    

      Goodkind noted that Thomas J. Felmer, who has served as Interim 
      President and CEO since last October, will return to his previous 
      position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
    

      “On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Tom for his leadership as 
      Interim CEO. Under his watch, Brady has seen an upturn in sales from 
      continuing operations and organic sales growth, he managed the 
      divestiture of our European and Asian die-cut businesses, and we were 
      chosen by Airbus to provide flexible print-on-demand RFID integrated 
      nameplates,” said Goodkind. “We are appreciative of Tom's leadership and 
      the Board looks forward to working with Michael, Tom and others in 
      growing shareholder value.”
    

      Nauman joins Brady after 20 years in a number of senior management 
      positions at Lisle, Illinois-based Molex 
      Incorporated. For the past five years, he was Molex’s Executive Vice 
      President and President of the Global Integrated Products Division, 
      where he led six global business units in the automotive, datacom, 
      industrial, medical, military/aerospace and mobile markets. Under 
      Nauman’s leadership, the Global Integrated Products Division grew to 
      12,000 employees at 26 locations in 13 countries with $1.2 billion in 
      annual sales.
    

      “I have been a Brady customer for many years and have always been 
      impressed with the quality of Brady's products and services, as well as 
      its history of innovation. I was excited to learn about the opportunity 
      at Brady,” said Nauman. “I’ve spent the past 20 years at a family 
      controlled public company with Midwestern roots and values similar to 
      Brady. Both companies share a global perspective and footprint and take 
      great pride in their histories. I am both motivated and energized to be 
      a part of the Brady family,” he added.
    

      “Brady has a 100-year legacy of high quality, reliability and 
      innovation. I will work to reinforce that culture and build on it to 
      drive profitable growth and differentiate Brady from its competition. My 
      goal is to make Brady even stronger and increase its industry leadership 
      for the next hundred years,” said Nauman.
    

      Nauman began his career as a tax accountant and auditor for Arthur 
      Andersen and Company before serving as Controller and then President of Ohio 
      Associated Enterprises, Inc. before 
      joining Molex in 1994.
    

      Nauman earned a Bachelor of Science in Management from Case 
      Western Reserve University, is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), 
      a Chartered 
      Global Management Accountant (CGMA) and holds three U.S. patents. He 
      is a board member of the Arkansas 
      Science & Technology Authority; Arkansas 
      Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Coalition; and Museum 
      of Discovery.

      subject to risks, assumptions, and other factors, some of which are 
      beyond Brady's control, that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking 
      statements. For Brady, uncertainties arise from: Implementation of the 
      Workplace Safety strategy; the length or severity of the current 
      worldwide economic downturn or timing or strength of a subsequent 
      recovery; future financial performance of major markets Brady serves, 
      which include, without limitation, telecommunications, hard disk drive, 
      manufacturing, electrical, construction, laboratory, education, 
      governmental, public utility, computer, healthcare and transportation; 
      future competition; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and 
      components; increased price pressure from suppliers and customers; 
      Brady's ability to retain significant contracts and customers; 
      fluctuations in currency rates versus the U.S. dollar; risks associated 
      with international operations; difficulties associated with exports; 
      risks associated with obtaining governmental approvals and maintaining 
      regulatory compliance; Brady's ability to develop and successfully 
      market new products; risks associated with identifying, completing, and 
      integrating acquisitions; risks associated with divestitures and 
      businesses held for sale; risks associated with restructuring plans; 
      environmental, health and safety compliance costs and liabilities; risk 
      associated with loss of key talent; risk associated with product 
      liability claims; technology changes and potential security violations 
      to the Company's information technology systems; Brady's ability to 
      maintain compliance with its debt covenants; increase in our level of 
      debt; potential write-offs of Brady's substantial intangible assets; 
      unforeseen tax consequences; risk, associated with our ownership 
      structure; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global 
      scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive, 
      and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady's U.S. 
      Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited 
      to, those factors listed in the “Risk Factors” section within Item 1A of 
      Part I of Brady’s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2013. These 
      uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially

                Press Release
            




J. Michael Nauman Named Brady Corporation CEO
 MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 4, 2014--
      Brady
      Corporation (NYSE: BRC) (“Brady”), a world leader in identification
      solutions, today announced the appointment of J. Michael Nauman as
      President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, effective immediately.

      “Michael Nauman is known and respected as a hands-on leader who thrives
      on attacking challenges, building customer relationships and driving
      product innovation,” said Conrad Goodkind, the Lead Independent Director
      of Brady’s Board. “His strong operational and financial background and
      experience in managing and growing diverse products and businesses
      throughout the world make him the ideal person to lead our business into
      the future.”
    

      Goodkind noted that Thomas J. Felmer, who has served as Interim
      President and CEO since last October, will return to his previous
      position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
    

      “On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Tom for his leadership as
      Interim CEO. Under his watch, Brady has seen an upturn in sales from
      continuing operations and organic sales growth, he managed the
      divestiture of our European and Asian die-cut businesses, and we were
      chosen by Airbus to provide flexible print-on-demand RFID integrated
      nameplates,” said Goodkind. “We are appreciative of Tom's leadership and
      the Board looks forward to working with Michael, Tom and others in
      growing shareholder value.”
    

      Nauman joins Brady after 20 years in a number of senior management
      positions at Lisle, Illinois-based Molex
      Incorporated. For the past five years, he was Molex’s Executive Vice
      President and President of the Global Integrated Products Division,
      where he led six global business units in the automotive, datacom,
      industrial, medical, military/aerospace and mobile markets. Under
      Nauman’s leadership, the Global Integrated Products Division grew to
      12,000 employees at 26 locations in 13 countries with $1.2 billion in
      annual sales.
    

      “I have been a Brady customer for many years and have always been
      impressed with the quality of Brady's products and services, as well as
      its history of innovation. I was excited to learn about the opportunity
      at Brady,” said Nauman. “I’ve spent the past 20 years at a family
      controlled public company with Midwestern roots and values similar to
      Brady. Both companies share a global perspective and footprint and take
      great pride in their histories. I am both motivated and energized to be
      a part of the Brady family,” he added.
    

      “Brady has a 100-year legacy of high quality, reliability and
      innovation. I will work to reinforce that culture and build on it to
      drive profitable growth and differentiate Brady from its competition. My
      goal is to make Brady even stronger and increase its industry leadership
      for the next hundred years,” said Nauman.
    

      Nauman began his career as a tax accountant and auditor for Arthur
      Andersen and Company before serving as Controller and then President of Ohio
      Associated Enterprises, Inc. before
      joining Molex in 1994.
    

      Nauman earned a Bachelor of Science in Management from Case
      Western Reserve University, is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA),
      a Chartered
      Global Management Accountant (CGMA) and holds three U.S. patents. He
      is a board member of the Arkansas
      Science & Technology Authority; Arkansas
      Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Coalition; and Museum
      of Discovery.

Forward Looking Statements


      Certain information in this news release constitutes "forward-looking
      statements." These forward-looking statements relate to, among other
      things, statements concerning the consummation of the sale of the
      Die-Cut business and the Company's future financial position, business
      strategy, targets, projected sales, costs, earnings, capital
      expenditures, debt levels and cash flows, and plans and objectives of
      management for future operations, all of which are based on current
      expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and
      uncertainties. The use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,”
      “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “should,” “project” or
      “plan” or similar terminology are generally intended to identify
      forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements by their
      nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain and are
      subject to risks, assumptions, and other factors, some of which are
      beyond Brady's control, that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
      statements. For Brady, uncertainties arise from: Implementation of the
      Workplace Safety strategy; the length or severity of the current
      worldwide economic downturn or timing or strength of a subsequent
      recovery; future financial performance of major markets Brady serves,
      which include, without limitation, telecommunications, hard disk drive,
      manufacturing, electrical, construction, laboratory, education,
      governmental, public utility, computer, healthcare and transportation;
      future competition; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and
      components; increased price pressure from suppliers and customers;
      Brady's ability to retain significant contracts and customers;
      fluctuations in currency rates versus the U.S. dollar; risks associated
      with international operations; difficulties associated with exports;
      risks associated with obtaining governmental approvals and maintaining
      regulatory compliance; Brady's ability to develop and successfully
      market new products; risks associated with identifying, completing, and
      integrating acquisitions; risks associated with divestitures and
      businesses held for sale; risks associated with restructuring plans;
      environmental, health and safety compliance costs and liabilities; risk
      associated with loss of key talent; risk associated with product
      liability claims; technology changes and potential security violations
      to the Company's information technology systems; Brady's ability to
      maintain compliance with its debt covenants; increase in our level of
      debt; potential write-offs of Brady's substantial intangible assets;
      unforeseen tax consequences; risk, associated with our ownership
      structure; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global
      scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive,
      and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady's U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited
      to, those factors listed in the “Risk Factors” section within Item 1A of
      Part I of Brady’s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2013. These
      uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially
      different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Brady
      does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements except as
      required by law.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
