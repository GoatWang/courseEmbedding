Solomon, MD2700 Quarry Lake Dr Ste 200, Baltimore, MD 21209(410) 415-5815View Business DetailsServices"Fish and Chips" found in 1 dishPhysicians General PractitionersArthritisPlantar FasciitisPediatric CareOrthopaedic concerns for children are unique, due to growing and developing bones, muscles, joints and nerves. It’s no wonder that compared to an adult’s body, a child’s body responds differently to orthopaedic treatments; for both musculoskeletal abnormalities and trauma. What’s more, younger patients respond differently on an emotional level too.Primary CareWe participate with most local and many national insurance plans*. However insurance coverage is a contract between you and your insurance carrier. It is your responsibility to understand whether your insurance has limitations on; coverage, the doctors you can see, or the services you may receive. Be sure to call your carrier and ask prior to your visit if you need a referral from your primary care physician.Emergency CareNeurologistsCarpal Tunnel SyndromeRadiologistX-RaysMRIOur Sports Medicine Center of Excellence provides diagnostic testing through x-rays and MRI, as well as treatment options including medication, physical therapy, bracing and when necessary surgery. As pioneers of arthroscopic surgery in Maryland we continue to offer the newest arthroscopic and reconstructive surgical techniques.RadiologyOur electronic medical record system allows for efficiency in patient registration, radiology studies, ordering of laboratory tests, generating prescriptions and simplifies communication between the members of your care team.SurgeonsGeneral SurgeryDr. Waldman received his medical doctorate from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and completed his General Surgery internship and Orthopaedic Surgery residency training at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He completed a Surgical Arthritis Service Fellowship at the Hospital for Special Surgery, Cornell University in New York City.OrthopedicsWhiplashDr. Grant has presented at several American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation annual conferences, sharing her research on the use of metabolic measurements in determining nutritional needs in children, work-related lower back injuries and hip motion control in subjects with prior lower limb musculoskeletal injury. While a member of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia School of Medicine, DR. Grant gave a number of presentations, most notably on whiplash syndrome rehabilitation, gender variations in pain and hip replacement.ArthroscopyDr. Buchalter’s surgical practice focuses on both arthroscopic and minimally invasive reconstructions of the shoulder, knee and hip. He is one of the Mid-Atlantic region’s few orthopaedic surgeons trained to perform hip arthroscopy for labral tears and femoral acetabular impingement. Dr. Buchalter is the first and only surgeon to perform hip arthroscopy at Greater Baltimore Medical Center (GBMC), and of Dr. Buchalter’s preferred hospitals, along with Northwest Hospital and Sinai Hospital of Baltimore.Minimally Invasive SurgeryNamed one of Baltimore Magazine’s Top Doctors, Dr. David Buchalter has established himself quick as one of the region’s preeminent orthopaedic surgeons. Dr. Buchalter subspecializes in Sports Medicine and offers patients the most current minimally invasive surgery techniques, getting his patients back to into their game rapidly and safely.Ankle SurgeryDr. Weiner also nurtures his interest in foot and ankle surgery, and his love for sports, by serving as a physician to the Maryland State Athletic Commission. He has been with OrthoMaryland since 1995 and is one of only a handful of physicians in the region with foot and ankle fellowship training.Joint ReplacementIf joint replacement is an option you are considering or a procedure that has been recommended for you, look no further than OrthoMaryland. Our specialists are recognized for their expertise in the latest joint replacement techniques for knee replacements and hip replacements. We also perform joint replacements on shoulders, fingers, elbows and ankles, though these procedures are not as common.Arthritis SurgeryHand SurgerySteven Friedman, MD, is board certified in Orthopaedic Surgery and holds a Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand and Upper Extremity. The highlights of his orthopaedic education include his experience training and serving as Chief Orthopaedic Resident at the Maryland Shock Trauma Center and his fellowship in Hand Surgery at Syracuse, New York.Orthopedic SurgeryThe OrthoMaryland story began in 1925. During that year, Dr. Moses Gellman (1896-1960) completed his specialty training in orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for Special Surgery (then known as The Hospital for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled). He returned to Maryland from New York City, and opened his practice in Baltimore.BunionsArthroscopyDr. Becker went on to pioneer arthroscopic surgery in Baltimore and became one of the first surgeons in Maryland to perform the procedure. A former chairman of the Baltimore Medical Society Sports Medicine Committee, he has lectured to numerous groups and organizations throughout the State on knee disorders, sports medicine and arthroscopy procedures.Hip Replacement, a member of our outstanding team, has contributed significantly to the advancement of minimally invasive hip replacement and custom knee replacements. And, he has designed instruments that are being used for this procedure in several countries. He works closely with Peter Jay, M.D.Knee ReplacementStatistics tell us that arthritis is the most frequent reason for performing knee replacement and hip replacement. For more information on arthritis and our Comprehensive Arthritis Institute, and OrthoMaryland Center of Excellence, click here.Knee ArthroscopyReconstructive SurgeryPodiatristsAnkle SprainOn choosing to specialize in orthopedics versus other types of medicine, Dr. Moatz said, “During my orthopedics rotation in medical school I found I enjoyed working with patients who had a variety of musculoskeletal problems, such as degenerative joint disease, traumatic fractures, or spinal stenosis. Each day brought new challenges, from learning to diagnose a sprained ankle in clinic, to casting a fracture in the emergency room or assisting in total knee replacement surgery. It gave me a great sense of accomplishment and pride to contribute to restoring function and improving the quality of life in my patients”.Bunions ProblemsA Baltimore native, Dr. Weiner uses his expertise in foot and ankle disorders to treat many conditions, including bunions, hammertoes, diabetic feet, plantar fasciitis and neuromas. “I get great satisfaction working on foot and ankle problems,” he says. “I see a wide range of patients, from athletes to the elderly, all of whom have unique needs. It’s very rewarding to help them regain their strength and mobility”. Dr. Weiner was named to Baltimore Magazine’s Top Doctor list in 2015.HammertoesPlantar FasciitisPhysical TherapistsSports MedicineOrthoMaryland specializes in providing comprehensive Sports Medicine services including diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. Our Sports Medicine team specializes in disorders of the knee and shoulder and offers the most innovative solutions for sports related injuries. Ultimately, our goal is to promptly and safely return our patients to athletic participation at their pre-injury levels.Physical TherapyWe have three locations, Baltimore at Quarry Lake, Lutherville and Owings Mills.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Deniers: The World Renowned Scientists Who Stood Up Against Global Warming Hysteria, Political Persecution, And Fraud...And Those Who Are Too Fearful To Do Soby Solomon, LawrenceTells the shocking stories of more than three-dozen world-renowned scientists whose work refutes global warming hysteria and gives the lie to claims from Al Gore and co. that  the science is settled.  Author Lawrence Solomon an internationally renowned environmentalist'shows these men have faced a vicious campaign of intimidation by those who, like Al Gore, seek to pervert science and silence dissent to advance their own political agenda. Some have been intimidated into silence. Others have seen their funding denied and their labs shut down as a result of political pressure. But the testimony of their work remains too powerful to deny.Extensively footnoted including URLs to crucial scientific papers (and lively e-mails detailing the inside politics of global warming) and lavishly illustrated with charts and graphs, The Deniers will do more than spark controversy. The Deniers is destined to become the most reliable and provocative source book on the real global warming debate.Science & Technology, Environmental ScienceCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
