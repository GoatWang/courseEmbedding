The prospectus, and if available the summary prospectus, contains complete information about the investment options available through your plan.

Retirement counselors are registered representatives of Prudential Investment Management Services LLC (PIMS), Newark, NJ, a Prudential Financial company.

You get tax deferral of your investment earnings through the qualified retirement plan in which you participate. Because you already enjoy this tax deferral, your decision to invest in an Individual Retirement Account or other variable annuity should be based on the annuity's investment and insurance features, such as the ability to annuitize and the death benefit.

Annuities are longer term investments intended for retirement savings. They contain fee, exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits, and terms for keeping them in force.

The sale or liquidation of any stock, bond, IRA, certificate of deposit, mutual fund, annuity, or other asset to fund the purchase of this product may have tax consequences, early withdrawal penalties, or other costs or penalties as a result of the sale or liquidation. You or your agent may wish to solicit independent legal or financial advice before selling or liquidating any assets, and prior to the purchase of any life or annuity products being solicited, offered for sale, or sold.

Amounts withdrawn before age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty, applicable taxes, and plan restrictions. Withdrawals are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates.

The PruSecure Account is a group annuity product issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (PICA), Newark, NJ 07102. Amounts contributed to the contract are deposited in PICA's general account. Payment obligations and the fulfillment of any guarantees specified in the group annuity contract are insurance claims supported by the full faith and credit of PICA. PICA periodically resets the interest rate credited on contract balances, subject to a minimum rate specified in the group annuity contract. Past interest rates are not indicative of future rates. This product is neither a mutual fund nor a bank product. The obligations of PICA are not insured by the FDIC or any other federal governmental agency. Prudential Retirement is compensated in connection with this product when general account investment returns exceed the interest credited on contract balances. Other than such compensation, there are no additional charges imposed that reduce the interest rate credited.

Retirement
FAQs for Retirement






             Why do I have a Customer Identification Number?
          






To protect your privacy, Prudential does not use your Social Security Number (SSN) in any correspondence we send you. Instead, we create a unique Customer Identification Number (CIN) for every person with an annuity as an identifier to be used in place of your SSN in our communications to you. The CIN is a nine-digit, alpha-numeric number that starts with a letter—for example, A12345678.








             What is the "Contract" that was purchased and what kind of annuity was purchased for me under it—a group annuity or an individual annuity?
          






The “Contract” that was purchased to provide your annuity is a group annuity contract offered through the Prudential Insurance Company of America. A group annuity contract is a financial product sold by an insurance company that provides a guaranteed stream of income for members of a group at stated intervals (in this case monthly) for each recipient’s lifetime, and, in some circumstances, if applicable, for the lifetime of a joint annuitant (such as a spouse) thereafter.








             What is a Contract Number and why do I need to reference it when I contact you?
          






A Contract Number is the unique identifying number assigned to the group annuity contract that covers the annuity that was purchased for you. Whenever you contact us by phone or mail, you should reference your Contract Number. It helps us locate your records on our administrative systems and enables us to be more responsive to you.








             On My Fact Sheet there’s a box – Important Information Regarding Beneficiary Designation. Why do I need to complete your Beneficiary Designation Form?
          






If this box appears on your Fact Sheet, then your benefit has a death benefit feature that requires you to designate a beneficiary:

Prudential is required to have your valid beneficiary designation form in our records. Since your prior payer did not transfer your prior beneficiary designation form to us, we ask that you complete the form enclosed in this folder and return it to Prudential to ensure that we have your valid beneficiary form on file.
If this box is not on your Fact Sheet, your benefit does not have a death benefit feature.









             I currently receive my pension benefit through direct deposit. Will Prudential continue that?
          






If you currently receive your pension through direct deposit, your prior payer provided that information to Prudential, and we will continue direct deposit of your benefit. No action or information is required on your part for Prudential to continue your direct deposit.








             How safe is my Prudential annuity?
          






Your annuity is provided under a group annuity contract issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey life insurance company whose principal office is located in Newark, New Jersey. As a highly regulated insurance company, The Prudential Insurance Company of America is required to maintain appropriate reserves to meet its financial obligations.

             What are the contribution limits for Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs for Tax Years 2016 and 2017?
          










 


Under age 50


Age 50 or Over




2016


Lesser of $5,500 or 100% of Taxable Income


Lesser of $6,500 or 100% of Taxable Income




2017


Lesser of $5,500 or 100% of Taxable Income


Lesser of $6,500 or 100% of Taxable Income












             What is the contribution deadline for Tax Year 2016?
          






Traditional IRA and Roth IRA contributions received between January 1 and the tax filing deadline may be attributed to tax year 2016. Written instructions indicating attribution to the previous tax year must accompany the contribution, or else the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year. The federal tax filing deadline for Tax Year 2016 is April 18, 2017.

IRA checks that are received after April 18, 2017, but on or before April 22, 2017 must be accompanied with proof that the check was post-marked to the Agent/Financial Professional on or before April 18, 2017. Proof should be a copy or fax of the envelope with the post-mark, or statement of proof of delivery by the USPS or courier service (i.e. UPS or Federal Express); not the actual envelope. Otherwise the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year.

All Tax Year Contributions received after April 22, 2017 will be coded with the 2017 Tax Year.

New contracts must be issued on or before April 18, 2017 for a contribution to be attributed to the 2016 tax year, even if a contribution is made with accompanying attribution instructions prior to the tax filing deadline.

All SEP IRA contributions are coded for the current calendar year, no exceptions.








             If my contract is owned by a trust and is not subject to 72(u), why was the Form 1099-R coded with a 1 in box 7 when I'm over 59?
          






Entity owned contracts, i.e. Trusts, are not subject to 72(u) will always use Distribution code 1, as there is no date of birth for an entity, except in the case of a Grantor Trust. Distributions from a Grantor Trust are reported based on the Grantor's date of birth (DOB), and it will be coded as a 1 for an early distribution or as a 7 for normal distribution based on the Grantor's DOB.








             Why wasn't my Form 1099-R coded as a disability payment?
          






The withdrawal form did not indicate disability. You can file IRS Form 5329 and would have to prove to the IRS on your own that the disability exception applies.








             Why is my entire distribution taxable?
          






For Non-Qualified contracts there are 2 possible reasons:

The distribution was all earnings; it did not contain any return of cost basis.
The contract is aggregated.

For Qualified contracts (except for Qualified Trustee Owned Pension Plans and 457 Plans):

Since some or all of the distribution may be taxable as ordinary income for the tax year in which the distribution is made. We report all distributions as fully taxable on IRS Form 1099-R. If a portion of the distribution is not taxable, you would indicate that on your own return.

Qualified contracts are funded with pretax dollars and Prudential doesn't track Cost Basis. Non-Qualified are funded with after tax dollars, and earnings are taxable and generally come out first.








             Why is box 2b "Taxable amount not determined" checked on my 1099-R?
          







Taxable Amount Not determined is used on Non-Qualified accounts that were funded with a 1035 exchange where the prior institution did not send us the cost basis
For Roth IRA contracts we report all distributions as taxable amount not determined









             Why does my Form 1099-R show such a high taxable amount compared to my cost basis?
          






If the taxable amount seems high this contract is most likely a non-qualified annuity that is part of an aggregated group.
Section 72(e) (12) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that all annuities entered into after October 21, 1988 be aggregated and treated as a single deferred annuity contract for the purpose of determining the amount of taxable gain includible in gross income. Aggregation applies to all contracts:

Purchased by the same contract owner
From the same insurance company and its affiliates
During the same calendar year

All non-qualified annuity contracts issued to the same contract owner, by the same insurance company or affiliate, in the same calendar year they are treated as a single contract for tax gain purposes. Aggregated groups are determined by the TIN of the owner.
Aggregation rules do not apply to: Qualified Contracts, Immediate Annuities, contracts subject to 72(u) of the Internal Revenue Code and contracts issued prior to October 21, 1988.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R if I converted my IRA into a Roth IRA?
          






An IRA to Roth conversion is generally fully taxable. Taxable amounts are included in income in the year of conversion subject to ordinary income tax. 10% withholding applies unless election out. RMD if applicable should be removed before the conversion.
Amounts converted from an eligible IRA to a Roth IRA are required to be included in the customer's taxable income in the year of conversion. Generally, this includes deductible contributions made to the IRA and any earnings on those contributions and the present value of the actuarial benefit if applicable. A Form 1099-R will be issued reflecting the conversion from the traditional to the Roth IRA. The Form 1099-R will reflect a distribution code of either a 2 (under 59 ½ with an exception) or 7 (over 59 ½). In addition, a Form 5498 will be generated to reflect the amounts converted to the Roth IRA.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R when I received these funds as a Death Claim?
          






Death proceeds from an annuity contract are taxable to the extent that there is gain. Under normal circumstances a beneficiary is responsible for the income tax on the death benefit they receive. However, there are exceptions to this general rule as indicated below.

On an annuitant driven contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are payable to the beneficiary. If the annuitant is the owner, tax reporting is to the beneficiary. If the annuitant and owner are different, tax reporting is to the owner.

On an owner driven contract the proceeds become payable upon death of the owner. For single owned contracts, the proceeds are paid to and reportable to the beneficiary. For Jointly owned contracts, if the surviving owner is not the beneficiary, the surviving owner will receive the tax reporting, however, the beneficiary will receive the proceeds.

On an Entity owned contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are paid to the beneficiary. The tax reporting is to the owner.

Consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus and the summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund. Contact your financial professional for a prospectus and the summary prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.
An investment in our money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the funds seek to preserve the value of yourclients investment at Widget.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the funds.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Some mutual funds have more risk than others. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate and investor's shares when sold may be worth more or less than the original cost. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. Asset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There is no guarantee a Fund's objectives will be achieved. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. Your clients should consult with their attorney, accountant, and/or tax professional for advice concerning their particular situation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
