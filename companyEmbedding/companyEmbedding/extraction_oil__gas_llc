Where We Operate | Extraction Oil & Gas






































 
























Where We Operate








Wattenberg Field
      	Extraction Oil & Gas operates in the Greater Wattenberg Field of Colorado’s Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin, targeting development of the Codell and Niobrara formations.
The Wattenberg Field, discovered in 1970, was historically a major gas field. It produced over 4.0 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas from the J Sand, Codell, and Niobrara formations from nearly 20,000 wells.
In 2009, operators began experimenting with multi-stage horizontal completion techniques in the Niobrara Chalks. The early results were significant and the development of the field immediately began to evolve from vertical infill drilling to a horizontal resource play. Operators have now had outstanding results in the Niobrara A, B and C benches as well as the Codell Sandstone. Extraction is focused on the western portion of the field where both the Niobrara and Codell are prospective.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
