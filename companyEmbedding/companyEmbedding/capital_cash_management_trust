Wholesale Cash Management Trust


Low risk, targeting capital security for the short-term
Cash is considered the least risky of the major asset classes – generally providing investors with a moderate regular income, but little chance of capital gain.
The Wholesale Cash Management Trust was developed particularly for those investors who are seeking capital preservation or have a short-term investment timeframe. The Fund invests chiefly in Australian fixed interest, money market securities and derivative instruments, and is primarily a low risk investment product that targets capital security.

"Cash and term deposits play an important role in most investors’ portfolios. They can help you with short-term cash flow needs, and provide relative stability and certainty during times that other investments are volatile."
Ilan Dekell, Head of Macro




A fund built with these goals in mind






Provides regular incomeThe Fund aims to provide investors with a secure at-call investment with regular monthly income return and ready access to your investment and to outperform the Bloomberg AusBond Bank Bill Index.







Offers diversificationTypically, the Fund holds a portfolio of fixed interest and money market securities (fixed or floating) and derivative instruments.







Low riskThe Fund suits investors who seek a low risk product or who have short-term (one to three year) investment goals.



How does this fund fit into your portfolio?



The Fund is designed for investors seeking a low risk product or who have short-term (one to three year) investment goals. It can be used to complement existing solutions in a blended portfolio or it can be used individually.

For instance it does not detail what the size of a negative return could be or the potential for a positive return to be less than an investor may require to meet their objectives. Consequently, before choosing to invest or reinvest in the Fund, you should read the Fund's PDS and incorporated information and consider factors such as the likely investment return, the risks of investing and your investment time frame.

Global fixed income and cash
Our investment philosophy is aligned to the needs of our clients


We believe the best way to invest in fixed income is to take an active, independent, valuation-driven approach. Prices can overshoot valuations in fixed income markets due to trending behaviours, and this is where the real opportunity lies.
Investing in fixed income requires an ability and resilience to be long when assets are cheap, and short when assets are expensive.
As well as actively managing risk within a disciplined, valuation-driven framework, we believe in adopting an investment process that is transparent and repeatable. Our approach includes an innovative company credit rating system at its core. Detailed research means every decision is analysed from a global context, and benefits from the diverse perspectives of the economics, property, infrastructure and equity teams.

“The most rewarding opportunities are when momentum and valuation coalesce”
Simon Warner, Global Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income



A$58.5 billion assets under management
50+ years investing in fixed income
4 global locations


As of 31 December 2016.


What sets us apart in fixed income


             
        







Our scale provides access to unique deal sourcing opportunities
As one of Asia’s largest fixed income managers, our extensive global networks provide us with access to unique deal sourcing opportunities. Our size and reputation also allows us to negotiate favourable terms and pricing for our clients.










A robust risk management process aims to create truly defensive portfolios
We conduct thorough due diligence, and use sophisticated risk management tools and systems to run stress and scenario tests. All companies in our universe of securities are internally rated, so we don’t rely solely on external credit rating agencies.










Our repeatable process aims to generate consistent outcomes
Our global relative value approach is transparent and repeatable. It is designed to get the best deal for our investors, and aims to generate consistent outcomes.










Culture of collaboration means greater insight into opportunities and threats
Fixed income analysts work closely with equity analysts to provide additional insights across all major industry sectors: financials, property, materials and energy, technology media and telecommunications, consumer industrials, utilities and infrastructure.




Our capabilities cover the entire fixed income spectrum




We also manage a diverse range of separately managed accounts such as global financial hybrids and global infrastructure debt.


Risks


Risks specific to fixed income investments may include credit risk (including counterparty default), interest rate risk, and risks associated with sovereign default, derivatives, international investments, currency exchange rates, short selling, gearing, hybrid securities, gearing, liquidity and movements in share markets. Please refer to the relevant fund’s Information Memorandum or Product Disclosure Statement for more information.

Cash Management Trusts
A Cash Management Trust account is an investment product rather than a straightforward bank account so it has a few different characteristics when compared to a cash management account or a savings account.
It is important that investors be aware of the differences so that they can make informed investment choices when they are deciding where to put their cash investment funds. 
Basically, a Cash Management Trust (CMT) is:
a managed investment where the funds of individual unit holders are pooled
the primary investment is in cash securities
the value of each unit does not change, it always remains at $1 
a relatively low risk investment product.
Compare this to a Cash Management Account (CMA).  A CMA is:
a bank account which can only be offered by a regulated banking institution
earns money market interest on cash balances
can also include access via a cheque, credit or debit card facility. 
Investors in a Cash Management Trust will have to receive a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) when they open a trust account and it is worthwhile to read the PDS carefully. Owners of a Cash Management Account should also receive a form of terms and conditions but generally do not have to be provided with a PDS.
Wherever you decide to invest your funds, some points you may want to consider are:
Return of capital – while these investments have a low risk of capital loss, repayment of capital invested in a CMT is not guaranteed.
Withdrawals – because the CMT is a trust the manager can decide to suspend withdrawals when it considers it to be in the best interest of CMT account holders.
Market risk – return on investment is directly affected by changes to the official cash rate as determined by the RBA.
Initial deposit – some CMT and CMA accounts may request that you deposit a minimum amount upon commencement, for example Macquarie Bank’s CMT requires $5,000 initial deposit.  Ordinary savings accounts typically have no or very low minimum deposit requirements.
Minimum operating balance – some accounts require a minimum amount to remain in the account at all times.
Types of Transactions – some CMT accounts may have limitations on the types of transaction that they associate with the account.  For example, some CMT accounts do not have a cheque or debit card facility.
Fees – some CMT accounts may charge management and ongoing fees.
Interest – usually calculated daily but paid monthly.   
Interest rates – CMT accounts generally offer competitive rates of interest, usually better than a savings account. Most CMA accounts offer tiered rates of return depending on account balances.
Underlying investments – the manager of the CMT generally pools the money of individual investors and this is then invested in short dated securities such as government and semi-government securities, bills of exchange, negotiable certificates of deposit, promissory notes, call deposits and other professional money market investments.  As such, it can be a convenient vehicle for the average investor to gain access to the professional money market.
Instrument risk - ensure an understanding of the instruments held by a CMT manager.
Management - consider whether the trust's management has the appropriate skills and experience to manage the investment.
It is up to you as an individual investor to decide which type of account will best suit your needs.

PROFESSIONALCASH MANAGEMENT
At Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, understanding the client differently means serving the client differently. We offer a variety of services tailored to meet the specific needs of our clientele and delivered to meet the high standards that our clients deserve.


Cash Management - Deposit and Lending Services


Cash is the lifeblood of your company, and that is why an effective and automated cash-management program forms the backbone of the Capital Accumulation Plan. In addition to offering a basic business checking account, Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust offers cash management solutions that enable your business to either use balances to offset bank fees or to automatically sweep money into its highest yielding account. Alternatively, Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust can establish a custom-tailored, cash-management program comprised of a Cash Management Business Checking Account, which primarily serves as a transaction account (e.g. payroll, writing checks, paying bills), a Money Market Account (which earns interest income) and a revolving line of credit, which provides liquidity in times of temporary cash shortfalls. Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust can also set up your Cash Management Business Checking Account as a zero balance account (ZBA). Under this arrangement, if your Cash Management Business Checking Account has a positive balance at the end of the day, the Bank will use these "excess" funds to either automatically pay down the balance of your revolving line of credit or transfer this positive balance into your Money Market Account. If your Cash Management Business Checking Account has a negative balance at the end of the day, then the Bank will automatically sweep funds from your Money Market Account or draw down your revolving line of credit according to your previously established preferences. Establishing an automated, cash-management program is one example of how Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust can enable greater efficiency for your business' financials and can produce a more effective way to manage your business' capital.
Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trusts Cash Management Services are comprised primarily of Transactional Accounts and Lending Solutions. In constructing your Capital Accumulation Plan, you may employ as many (or as few) of these solutions as you need.
Business Transactional Accounts include:

Professional Business Checking: The Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust Professional Business Checking Account is designed for clients requiring limited activity and a limited need for tailored product flexibility.  
Cash Management Business Checking:  As Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust’s Account Analysis product, Cash Management Business Checking allows collected balances to offset service charges. However, you can also elect to simply maintain a zero balance and pay activity fees.  
Cash Management Money Market Account:  The Cash Management Money Market Account is intended to offer you the payment of interest at tiered rates. This account can be linked to the Cash Management Business Checking Account to provide automated investment sweep capability. 

Business Lending Solutions include:

General Lending To Business Clients: Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust offers a competitive array of general business lending services.  
Commercial Real Estate Lending:  Our commercial real estate lending solutions have been designed to support any number of ventures.  

For more information, please contact your Private Capital Manager. To obtain a PCM, please contact Richard Keneman, Principal Private Capital Manager, at 312.640.2350.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Fidelity Cash Management Account FAQs

















          The Fidelity Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
	
    

          The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured account at one or more Program Banks where it earns a variable rate of interest. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at www.FDIC.gov. As referenced in the FDIC Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosure Document for the Fidelity Cash Management Account, customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. All FDIC insurance coverage is in accordance with FDIC rules. See the list of eligible Program Banks.
	
    

          1. All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus®, or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to the account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, N.A. and the check card program is administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company. Those entities are not affiliated with each other or with Fidelity Investments. Visa is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association, and is used by PNC Bank pursuant to license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.
	
    

          2. The Fidelity® Cash Management Account's uninvested cash balance is swept to one or more program banks where it earns a variable rate of interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. At a minimum, there are five banks available to accept these deposits, making customers eligible for nearly $1,250,000 of FDIC insurance. If the number of available banks changes, or you elect not to use, and/or have existing assets at, one or more of the available banks, the actual amount could be higher or lower. For more information on FDIC insurance coverage, please visit www.FDIC.gov. Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance coverage in accordance with FDIC rules. Refer to the FDIC-Insured Cash (Core) Disclosure Statement and list of eligible Program Banks for details. The deposits at Program Banks are not covered by SIPC.

You're only three easy steps from moving your checking account to a Fidelity Cash Management Account.
















          The Fidelity® Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
	
    

Fidelity is not a bank and brokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured, but uninvested cash balances are eligible for FDIC insurance.


          1. All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account, at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus® or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to your Fidelity Cash Management Account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, NA and administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments. The third-party trademarks appearing herein are the property of their respective owners.
	
    

          2. The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured interest bearing account at a Program Bank. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. All assets of the account holder at the depository institution will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at FDIC.gov or call 877-ASK-FDIC.
