FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Our Growth

But Ephrata National Bank’s commitment to our local bank customers here in Lancaster County and surrounding areas has not. Since that time, we’ve been committed to providing outstanding banking services and an unrelenting commitment to our local community. We’ve received awards for our financial soundness and stability and have remained so well-capitalized that our shareholders have always received dividends, even during the Great Depression and recent Great Recession. When you bank with Ephrata National Bank, we guarantee “You’ll feel the difference”.
