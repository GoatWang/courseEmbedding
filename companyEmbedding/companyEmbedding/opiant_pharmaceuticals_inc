It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

Opiant Pharmaceuticals |   Opioid Antagonists

 investor.relations@opiant.com
 














 

















 


























Opioid Antagonists












Opioid antagonists block the binding of opioids to their target opioid receptors. When opioids or endorphins bind to these opioid receptors, they stimulate the activation of the brain’s reward circuitry. As opioid and endorphin receptors are modulators of dopamine levels, opioid antagonists can help to manage the activation of the reward circuitry.
There are 3 opioid antagonists approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): nalmefene, naltrexone, and naloxone. Development of nalmefene as a treatment for alcohol dependency was pioneered by Dr. David Sinclair using the principles of harm reduction and symptom-driven treatment. Currently, nalmefene is formulated as an oral tablet for alcohol dependency in Europe. Naltrexone is administered as an oral tablet or by depot injection to treat alcohol and substance use dependency.
Today, naloxone is used by paramedics and physicians to reverse the respiratory depression that is caused by opioid overdose. It is currently approved only as an injectable drug, which limits its availability of use. Opiant’s naloxone nasal spray allows a much larger population to administer treatment quickly and safely.

 


Treatment with opioid antagonists, blocks opioids in critical brain regions, reducing dopamine, and therefore reward

Opiant Pharmaceuticals |   Cocaine Use Disorder















































 

















 











  1-424-252-4756
 investor.relations@opiant.com
 














 

















 


























Cocaine Use Disorder












There are about 1.5 million current cocaine abusers in the U.S., as reported by The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
Cocaine blocks dopamine transporters, which increases the amount of dopamine in the brain and increases activation of the reward circuitry. Chronic cocaine use has also been shown to increase in the number of opioid receptors expressed in the reward circuitry. When opioids activate opioid receptors they initiate a dopamine release which activates the reward circuitry. Opioid antagonists can help to manage cocaine-induced activation of the reward circuitry by both blocking the activation of increased opioid receptors and limiting opioid-initiated dopamine release.
Presently, there are no medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat cocaine addiction and treatment is limited to behavioral interventions. Opiant’s opioid antagonist nasal spray could be used as a symptom-driven therapy to manage activation of the reward circuitry and help patients reduce or avoid cocaine use. Opiant is currently evaluating its opioid antagonist nasal spray for the treatment of cocaine use disorder.

He has participated in two DSM-5 research work groups, addressing topics relating to gambling, impulse control, and addiction.
Dr. Potenza’s research has focused on the neurobiology and treatment of substance and non-substance addictions and other disorders characterized by impaired impulse control and reward-related motivations. The majority of this work has focused on understanding clinical and neurobiological underpinnings of these disorders, and their co-occurrences with other mental health disorders, in order to advance prevention and treatment strategies. Dr. Potenza’s research has applied brain imaging, genetic, epidemiological and clinical trials methodologies to gain knowledge and improve prevention and treatment strategies for addictive disorders. This work has also involved identifying potential intermediary phenotypes, like facets of impulsivity, that may in part explain the high rates of co-occurrence between psychiatric conditions and might represent novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies.

Opioid Overdose Reversal












About Opioid Overdose
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that, in the U.S., there is one opioid overdose death every 19 minutes; and every day 7,000 people are treated in emergency departments for using painkillers in a manner other than as directed. The difference between an effective and fatal opioid dosage can be small and unpredictable. Both patients who are prescribed opioids and subjects who abuse opioids are at risk for overdose. This is because in addition to mediating pain relief opioids reduce the rate of respiration. During an opioid overdose the most prevalent hazard from the significant increase in activation of opioid receptors is respiratory depression, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
Currently, injectable naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose, but is only effective if administered in time. Opioid antagonists can prevent and reverse overdose through binding to opioid receptors in the brain and thus prevent exogenous opioids (such as heroin or opioid painkillers) from activating these opioid receptors.
In collaboration with its commercial partner, Adapt Pharma, Opiant has developed a naloxone nasal spray, a treatment for opioid overdoses and alternative to injection treatments. NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray has FDA approval for commercial use in the United States. As Opiant’s naloxone nasal treatment is designed to be administered by a broad population, it has the potential advantage that a trained healthcare professional is not required to administer the drug.

Opiant
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Phase I Data for OPNT002 in Development for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder 
 
Intravail® Increased the
Rate of Absorption of Intranasal Naltrexone
 
No Serious Adverse Events or Evidence of
Nasal Irritation
 
Contract Signed with Renaissance to Advance
Product Development
 
SANTA MONICA, California – July 19,
2017 – Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Opiant”) (OTCQB:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological
treatments for addictions and eating disorders, today announced results from a Phase 1 trial of OPNT002, an intranasally dosed
(IN) formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride (naltrexone), in development for the treatment of Alcohol Use
Disorder (AUD). This study was conducted under a clinical trial agreement between Opiant and the National Institute of Drug Abuse
(NIDA), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study examined the effects of Intravail®, an
absorption enhancer, on the pharmacokinetic properties of IN naltrexone in healthy volunteers. The trial also assessed the safety
of IN naltrexone, particularly with respect to nasal irritation. Opiant has also signed an agreement
 with Renaissance to initiate
work on the product development.
 
Some notable Phase 1 findings include:
 

·Intravail®, recently licensed by Opiant from Aegis
Therapeutics, increased the maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of IN naltrexone by almost three-fold compared to IN
naltrexone alone.
  

·The addition of Intravail® significantly accelerated
the time (Tmax) to reach maximum observed plasma concentrations of naltrexone, from 30 minutes to 10 minutes.
 

·No safety or tolerability concerns were
identified; there was no evidence of nasal irritation.
 


 
 

 
“Naltrexone is a well-known treatment
for AUD, and this study sheds new light on the potential clinical benefits of combining intranasally administered naltrexone with
Intravail®,” said Stephanie Samples O’Malley, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry; Director, Division of Substance
Abuse Research in Psychiatry; Deputy Chair, Clinical Research at Yale School of Medicine and consultant to Opiant Pharmaceuticals.
“Although the sample size of this study is small, these data suggest that pairing Intravail® with IN naltrexone
enhances the effect of the drug which could support the development of a new method for treating AUD.”
 
Phil Skolnick, Ph.D., D.Sc. (hon.), Chief
Scientific Officer at Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. added, “We are very excited by the observed changes in the pharmacokinetic
properties of intranasal naltrexone when combined with Intravail®, particularly the ability of Intravail®
to reduce the time needed to reach maximum plasma concentrations, which implies a more rapid onset of action. Although additional
clinical work is required, the ability to rapidly deliver an intranasal dose of naltrexone on an ‘as needed’ basis
has the potential to offer patients a much-needed innovation in the treatment of AUD.”
 
Study Design:
This study was an in-patient, open-label,
four-period, four-treatment, one-sequence, crossover design. Subjects were 14 healthy male and female volunteers ages 18 to 55
with no pre-existing nasal abnormalities. Each subject received four naltrexone treatments during the four dosing periods.
 
Summary of topline data:
When the IN naltrexone formulation included
Intravail®, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased 3-fold and the median time to reach the
maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) decreased from 30 minutes to 10 minutes. The median time to reach maximum
observed plasma concentration of IN naltrexone administered with Intravail was also more rapid than an intramuscular injection.
Absorption of naltrexone after oral administration of 50 mg was slower than either IN or IM administration at earlier time points.
 
All treatments were considered safe and
well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events (AEs) observed.
 
Opiant has signed a contract manufacturing
agreement with Renaissance (Lakewood, NJ) to begin work on optimizing an IN naltrexone formulation for Phase II studies. “Signing
this agreement represents significant progress towards advancing this pipeline,” said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive
Officer of Opiant. “We worked with Renaissance (previously DPT) for commercial manufacturing of the NARCAN Nasal Spray, so
we have a high degree of confidence in their ability to deliver.”
 


 
 

 
About Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a specialty
pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders. NIDA, a division of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), describes these disorders as chronic relapsing brain diseases which burden society at both the individual
and community levels. With its innovative opioid antagonist nasal delivery technology, Opiant is positioned to become a leader
in these treatment markets. Its first product, NARCAN® Nasal Spray, is approved for marketing in the U.S. and Canada by the
company’s partner, Adapt Pharma Limited. For more information please visit: www.opiant.com.
 
About Intravail®
 
Intravail® drug delivery technology
facilitates non-invasive delivery of a broad range of non-peptide and peptide drugs, as well as non-invasive delivery of protein
drugs that can currently only be administered by injection, via the oral, buccal, and intranasal administration routes, with high
bioavailability and increased speed of absorption.
 
About Naltrexone
 
Naltrexone is a high affinity opioid receptor antagonist. 
Initially approved by the FDA to treat opioid use disorders, subsequent clinical studies led to its approval to treat AUDs in 1994.
Both clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that that alcohol consumption triggers the release of endorphins and enkephalins,
naturally occurring opioid like peptides. By blocking the effects of these molecules at opioid receptors, naltrexone reduces craving
for alcohol as well as the amount of alcohol consumed.

About Intravail® Intravail® drug delivery technology facilitates non-invasive delivery of a broad range of non-peptide and peptide drugs, as well as non-invasive delivery of protein drugs that can currently only be administered by injection, via the oral, buccal, and intranasal administration routes, with high bioavailability and increased speed of absorption. About Naltrexone Naltrexone is a high affinity opioid receptor antagonist.  Initially approved by the FDA to treat opioid use disorders, subsequent clinical studies led to its approval to treat AUDs in 1994. Both clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that that alcohol consumption triggers the release of endorphins and enkephalins, naturally occurring opioid like peptides. By blocking the effects of these molecules at opioid receptors, naltrexone reduces craving for alcohol as well as the amount of alcohol consumed.

Intravail® Increased the Rate of Absorption of Intranasal Naltrexone No Serious Adverse Events or Evidence of Nasal Irritation Contract Signed with Renaissance to Advance Product Development SANTA MONICA, Calif., July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Opiant”) (OTCQB:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders, today announced results from a Phase 1 trial of OPNT002, an intranasally dosed (IN) formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride (naltrexone), in development for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This study was conducted under a clinical trial agreement between Opiant and the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study examined the effects of Intravail®, an absorption enhancer, on the pharmacokinetic properties of IN naltrexone in healthy volunteers. The trial also assessed the safety of IN naltrexone, particularly with respect to nasal irritation. Opiant has also signed an agreement with Renaissance to initiate work on the product development. Some notable Phase 1 findings include: Intravail®, recently licensed by Opiant from Aegis Therapeutics, increased the maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of IN naltrexone by almost three-fold compared to IN naltrexone alone. The addition of Intravail® significantly accelerated the time (Tmax) to reach maximum observed plasma concentrations of naltrexone, from 30 minutes to 10 minutes. No safety or tolerability concerns were identified; there was no evidence of nasal irritation. “Naltrexone is a well-known treatment for AUD, and this study sheds new light on the potential clinical benefits of combining intranasally administered naltrexone with Intravail®,” said Stephanie Samples O’Malley, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry; Director, Division of Substance Abuse Research in Psychiatry; Deputy Chair, Clinical Research at Yale School of Medicine and consultant to Opiant Pharmaceuticals. “Although the sample size of this study is small, these data suggest that pairing Intravail® with IN naltrexone enhances the effect of the drug which could support the development of a new method for treating AUD.” Phil Skolnick, Ph.D., D.Sc. (hon.), Chief Scientific Officer at Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  added, “We are very excited by the observed changes in the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal naltrexone when combined with Intravail®, particularly the ability of Intravail® to reduce the time needed to reach maximum plasma concentrations, which implies a more rapid onset of action. Although additional clinical work is required, the ability to rapidly deliver an intranasal dose of naltrexone on an ‘as needed’ basis has the potential to offer patients a much-needed innovation in the treatment of AUD.” Study Design:This study was an in-patient, open-label, four-period, four-treatment, one-sequence, crossover design. Subjects were 14 healthy male and female volunteers ages 18 to 55 with no pre-existing nasal abnormalities. Each subject received four naltrexone treatments during the four dosing periods. Summary of topline data:When the IN naltrexone formulation included Intravail®, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased 3-fold and the median time to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) decreased from 30 minutes to 10 minutes. The median time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration of IN naltrexone administered with Intravail was also more rapid than an intramuscular injection. Absorption of naltrexone after oral administration of 50 mg was slower than either IN or IM administration at earlier time points. All treatments were considered safe and well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events (AEs) observed. Opiant has signed a contract manufacturing agreement with Renaissance (Lakewood, NJ) to begin work on optimizing an IN naltrexone formulation for Phase II studies. “Signing this agreement represents significant progress towards advancing this pipeline,” said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Opiant.  “We worked with Renaissance (previously DPT) for commercial manufacturing of the NARCAN Nasal Spray, so we have a high degree of confidence in their ability to deliver.” About Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders. NIDA, a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), describes these disorders as chronic relapsing brain diseases which burden society at both the individual and community levels.

Its first product, NARCAN® Nasal Spray, is approved for marketing in the U.S. and Canada by the company’s partner, Adapt Pharma Limited. For more information please visit: www.opiant.com.

Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces FDA Orange Book Listing for New NARCAN® Nasal Spray Patent
Listing Bolsters IP Estate and Enhances NARCAN Product Exclusivity

SANTA MONICA, Calif., June  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Opiant”) (OTCQB:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders, today announced that its most recently issued U.S. Patent No. 9,629,965 covering the formulation and methods of use for NARCAN® Nasal Spray (“NARCAN”), is now listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. “We now have five Orange Book-listed patents for NARCAN and are encouraged by our solid intellectual property position and enhanced product exclusivity,” said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Opiant. “This latest patent also has the potential to be valuable for some of Opiant’s additional programs.”  U.S. Patent No. 9,629,965 claims intranasal formulations, devices comprising them, and methods of treatment of opioid overdose for the four-milligram dose of NARCAN. An Orange Book listing requires an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) applicant seeking FDA approval of a generic version of NARCAN to notify the Company and its partner, Adapt Pharma, before it can obtain FDA approval. This would be subject to a 30-month stay of marketing approval and potentially longer if such notification occurs and a patent infringement suit is successful. About Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders. NIDA, a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), describes these disorders as chronic relapsing brain diseases which burden society at both the individual and community levels.

Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Licenses Aegis Therapeutics' Intravail® Drug Delivery Technology






GlobeNewswire



Jun 28, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 


















































 SANTA MONICA, Calif., June 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Opiant") (OTCQB:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders, today announced a global, exclusive licensing agreement providing Opiant access to Aegis' Intravail® drug delivery technology for all of Opiant's opioid antagonist compounds. Financial terms were not disclosed. "We are fortunate to be able to access Aegis' proprietary Intravail® drug delivery technologies for applications that may benefit patients with addictions and eating disorders," said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Opiant. "Aegis' Intravail® can improve the absorption of drugs delivered nasally and has been designated generally recognized as safe (GRAS)." Edward T. Maggio, Chief Executive Officer of Aegis added, "The Intravail® non-invasive absorption enhancement technology is particularly well suited for the treatment of chronic relapsing brain diseases and will help ensure that Opiant Pharmaceuticals maintains its leaderhip position in this field. We are excited to support these important programs."    About Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions and eating disorders. NIDA, a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), describes these disorders as chronic relapsing brain diseases which burden society at both the individual and community levels. With its innovative opioid antagonist nasal delivery technology, Opiant is positioned to become a leader in these treatment markets. Its first product, NARCAN® Nasal Spray, is approved for marketing in the U.S. and Canada by the company's partner, Adapt Pharma Limited. For more information please visit: www.opiant.com.  About Aegis Therapeutics    Aegis Therapeutics LLC is a drug delivery technology company commercializing its patented drug delivery and drug formulation technologies through product-specific licenses. Its Intravail® drug delivery technology enables the non-invasive delivery of a broad range of protein, peptide and non-peptide drugs that can currently only be administered by injection, via the oral, buccal, and intranasal administration routes, and with high bioavailability. Its ProTek® excipients stabilize, prevent aggregation and reduce unwanted immunogenicity and anaphylaxis of protein and peptide therapeutics while avoiding the oxidative damage caused by polysorbate surfactants currently found in most protein injectable drugs. For more information, please visit www.aegisthera.com.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."
