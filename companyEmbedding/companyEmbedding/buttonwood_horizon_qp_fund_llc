Investor Alert: Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC





(Last Updated On: April 7, 2017)Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC Investment Losses
Have you suffered losses investing in Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC? If so, the attorneys at The White Law Group may be able to help.
Buttonwood Alpha QP Fund LLC submitted form D announcing $100,000,000 equity financing and was able to sell $3,375,000. That is 3% of the round of financing. The total private offering amount was $100,000,000 and the financing was made by 31 investors. Minimal accepted investment was $0. The financing document was filed on 2014-04-02. Buttonwood Alpha QP Fund LLC is based in New York, and the firm’s business is Investing. The form was signed by Stephan Stein.
Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC is a Reg D private placement. Reg D private placements involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds. The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling private placements like Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
Recovery of Investment Losses
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Buttonwood Alpha Q P Fund, LLC, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.
