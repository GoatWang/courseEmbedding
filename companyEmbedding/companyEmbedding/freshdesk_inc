If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Freshworks | Press releases










































Freshdesk Inc. Is Now Freshworks Inc.
New umbrella brand provides product clarity, enables future growth of feature-rich, easy-to-use and affordable business software suite.












SAN BRUNO, CALIFORNIAJune 7, 2017

Today Freshdesk announced the creation of Freshworks, a new umbrella brand that will bring together the company’s growing suite of business software. Following breakout growth of the company’s customer support software, and the introduction of new products for IT Service Management (ITSM), customer relationship management (CRM) and cloud-based call centers, Freshworks products are designed to help companies better engage and communicate with their customers and employees.
Freshworks brings together a suite of products for businesses, including:

 Freshdesk: a multichannel customer support helpdesk which allows organizations to collaborate and support their customers through email, phone, websites, forums and social media.
 Freshservice: a cloud-based service desk and IT Service Management solution to address the growing complexity of teams’ IT support needs through a simple but powerful interface.
 Freshsales: a full-featured CRM solution for  sales teams handling high-velocity leads.
 Freshcaller: A fully functional call center on the cloud

"In 2010, we started Freshdesk as a “fresh helpdesk” with a dream to make a dent in the world of customer support. While Freshdesk continued to grow exponentially, as a company, we moved beyond customer service by offering innovative products in the ITSM and CRM domains. As we expand our vision and build more exciting products, we felt that this was the right time to create a new brand that would allow us to tell our multi-product story better” said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO & Founder of Freshworks. “Today, I’m happy to announce that we are rebranding the company as Freshworks. We’re not in this just to change the way businesses do customer support, but to refresh the way they do business. Our goal is to build a company that is loved by employees, customers and shareholders alike.”
Over the years, businesses have found themselves in a position where they had to use cumbersome software across the organization. These solutions were not only expensive, but also required long implementation cycles and were extremely difficult to use without expert training, neither of which could be afforded by growing companies. Enterprises are also tired of wasting time and resources on trying to make everything work together.
According to Girish, Freshworks will bridge this gap by offering products that are ready-to-go, easy to setup and use and will be affordable for companies of all sizes. Adopted by over 100,000 companies in 145 countries, Freshworks’ mission is exactly this - to help companies better engage and communicate with their customers and employees with refreshing business software that is easy-to-use, feature-packed and accessible to businesses of all sizes. Whether you are a company looking to share customer data and insights across your sales and support teams or quickly onboard and set-up new employees, Freshworks’ integrated software products ensure all teams are all working together in sync.  In addition to being fully-featured, all of Freshworks’ products come with free support over email and phone, making them attractive for businesses looking for value against more expensive alternatives.
"For us, integrating customer support, sales and IT is critical to providing the best customer experience possible,” said Amit Chaudhary, COO and Founder at Lenskart."We started using Freshdesk in 2015 and began using Freshsales last year, and it’s made a huge impact on how we communicate both with customers and internally. Companies like Freshworks are truly changing how businesses think about software, including enterprises"
The stakes for providing a superior customer experience have never been higher. Data shows that 82% of customers stopped doing business with a company due to poor customer experience in 2016. At the same time, providing a seamless experience means looking at the full customer lifecycle, from sales to support. As internal teams become more integrated, these can no longer happen in silos. This is the problem that Freshworks has set out to solve.
Now, precisely six years after launching Freshdesk, Freshworks has become a global, award-winning SaaS powerhouse with five offices in Chennai, San Bruno, London, Sydney and Berlin.

About Freshworks
Freshworks Inc. is the parent company behind the suite of products which includes Freshdesk, Freshservice, Freshsales and Freshcaller. The company’s suite of products is designed to work tightly together to increase collaboration and help teams better connect and communicate with their customers and co-workers. Founded in October 2010, Freshworks Inc. is backed by Accel, Tiger Global Management, CapitalG and Sequoia Capital India. Freshworks has its HQ in San Bruno, California and global offices in India, UK, Australia and Germany. The company's cloud-based suite of SaaS products is widely used by over 100,000 customers around the world including Honda, Bridgestone, Hugo Boss, University of Pennsylvania, Toshiba and Cisco.

Make sure every issue gets resolved with powerful ticketing



Know who else is working on your ticket with agent collision detection 



See your ticket's status and when it is due



Use private notes for internal communication



Get contextual customer information from right inside your tickets



Send well-formatted replies using the rich text editor



View and manage ticket properties with just a few clicks












Team Inbox
Freshdesk’s shared inbox enables your team to collaborate and resolve issues without getting in each other’s way. Every request sent to your support email becomes a ticket in your helpdesk. You can easily categorize and prioritize tickets and assign them to the right people in your team. 
And you don't have to worry about multiple agents responding to the same ticket anymore because everyone on your team can see who is working on what ticket and its status. It is so easy to set up and use that you’ll be able to start resolving tickets in minutes.

Ensure tickets get resolved with the shared team inbox














Service Level Agreements
Set, manage, and meet customer expectations by setting up service level agreements (SLAs) for support. With Freshdesk, you can define ticket priorities and requirements for resolution times so your agents know exactly which issues to address first and how quickly the customer expects a response. Every ticket in Freshdesk follows your SLA policy and the ‘due by’ time is driven by their priority. And when a ticket becomes overdue, your helpdesk will make sure that the agent is notified of it. 
You can also define your own business hours so that your customers know when to expect support, and your SLAs know when you're off. So, no matter how crowded your support inbox is, critical customer requests won’t get lost. 

Meet or exceed customer expectations every time with SLAs








Mobile Apps
Carry your support desk with you wherever you go, with the free Freshdesk iPhone and Android apps. Reply to tickets, add notes and perform bulk actions on tickets even as you're taking a walk down the street or waiting for your order to arrive at a restaurant. All that and more, completely free.
Freshdesk also has a mobile-ready web-based version that can be used to access your helpdesk from the browser on any device. 
Learn more about supporting customers on the go



















Getting things done faster




Canned Responses

Stop wasting time writing the same replies again and again. Ensure quick consistent responses to common questions by creating pre-formatted replies. 




Suggested Solutions

Freshdesk automatically provides you with smart suggestions of possible solutions right next to the ticket, based on keywords in the ticket's description. 




Bulk Actions

Need to assign multiple tickets to the same agent? With bulk actions, things like categorizing, assigning or deleting a hundred tickets just take a few clicks.






Keyboard Shortcuts

Freshdesk has a long list of useful keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate through your helpdesk, perform quick actions, and expedite dozens of common tasks. 




Merge Tickets

Ever have a customer report the same issue multiple times via different channels, causing confusion? No problem. Merge all of the related tickets together, and resolve it in one go. 




Scenario Automations

Scenario automations let you perform a series of tasks on a ticket. Mark a ticket as high priority, set its status as pending and assign it to the dev team with just a single click.











					Freshdesk is simple to set-up. I particularly like the email messaging and the self service portal, both from the helpdesk and the customer’s side. I have looked at other similar products and in my view Freshdesk was the best value for money!

Freshdesk is a cloud-based customer support platform that was founded with the mission of enabling companies of all sizes to provide great customer service.  Our goal is simple: make it easy for brands to talk to their customers and make it easy for users to get in touch with businesses
The idea for our flagship product was the result of a bad customer experience thanks to a broken TV. The founders saw a need for a better customer support solution that could help provide better customer experience, and also scale as companies grow. So they started building one. Six months later, in June 2011, Freshdesk won the Microsoft BizSpark Startup Challenge and one hundred days after that we celebrated our 100th customer.
In six years, we have grown exponentially. Today we have more than 900 passionate employees globally and Freshdesk helps over 100,000 businesses and organizations around the world offer better, more personal support to their customers. And of course, we use Freshdesk ourselves to keep our customers happy.

New umbrella brand provides product clarity, enables future growth of feature-rich, easy-to-use and affordable business software suite







Freshworks Family Logos

As we expand our vision and build more exciting products, we believe this is the right time to create a new brand that allows us to tell our multi-product story better.


San Bruno, California (PRWEB)
June 07, 2017
 Today Freshdesk announced the creation of Freshworks, a new umbrella brand that will bring together the company’s growing suite of business software. Following breakout growth of the company’s customer support software, and the introduction of new products for IT Service Management (“ITSM”), customer relationship management (“CRM”) and cloud-based call centers, Freshworks products are designed to help companies better engage and communicate with their customers and employees.
Today, the Freshworks suite of products includes:
Freshdesk: a multichannel customer support helpdesk which allows organizations to collaborate and support their customers through email, phone, websites, forums and social media
Freshservice: a cloud-based service desk and IT Service Management solution to address the growing complexity of teams’ IT support needs through a simple but powerful interface
Freshsales: a full-featured CRM solution for sales teams handling high-velocity leads
Freshcaller: a fully functional call center on the cloud
"In 2010, we started Freshdesk as a ‘fresh helpdesk’ with a dream to make a dent in the world of customer support. While Freshdesk continues to grow exponentially, as a company, we moved beyond customer service by offering innovative products in the ITSM, CRM and call center domains. As we expand our vision and build more exciting products, we believe this is the right time to create a new brand that allows us to tell our multi-product story better,” said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO & Founder of Freshworks. “Today, I’m happy to announce that we are rebranding the company as Freshworks. We’re not in this just to change the way businesses do customer support, but to refresh the way they do business. Our goal is to build a company that is loved by employees, customers and shareholders alike.”
Until now, businesses have had few options for business software, turning to all-in-one, cumbersome legacy solutions across the organization. These solutions are not only expensive, but also require long implementation cycles and are extremely difficult to use without expert training, neither of which are afforded by growing companies. At the same time, enterprises are also tired of wasting time and resources on trying to make everything work together. Freshworks offers a product portfolio that is easily implemented and affordable for companies of all sizes. 
"For us, integrating customer support, sales and IT is critical to providing the best customer experience possible,” said Amit Chaudhary, COO and Founder at Lenskart."We started using Freshdesk in 2015 and began using Freshsales last year, and it’s made a huge impact on how we communicate both with customers and internally. Companies like Freshworks are truly changing how businesses think about software, including enterprises"
Adopted by over 100,000 companies in 145 countries, Freshworks’ mission is to help companies better engage and communicate with their customers and employees with refreshing business software. For companies looking to share customer data and insights across sales and support teams or quickly onboard and set-up new employees, Freshworks’ integrated software products ensure all teams are working together in sync.

Freshdesk Inc. rebrands itself to Freshworks Inc., Offerings to remain the same

Freshdesk Inc. has rebranded itself to Freshworks Inc. The Chennai-based helpdesk software maker announced the news on June 6. The rebrand comes off the need to explain their story better. Freshdesk Inc. initially started as a customer support helpdesk software maker, but has fast expanded to making other products and acquired various other cloud-based business management related products.
While the rebranding is effective immediately, Freshdesk Inc. will continue to offer its products under the same name. Freshdesk, Freshservice, Freshsales, Hotline, Freshchat, Freshcaller are few big names under its suite of business management products. These will to continue to be available under the same name.
In 2010, Freshdesk started out as a customer support software. Since then, the company has forayed into a range of other domains including ITSM, CRM and mobile support management. In 2014, Freshservice was launched and clocked 1M dollars revenue mark in 10 months. That was Freshdesk’s big moment and noticably Freshdesk’s successful take at creating multiproducts venture.
As of 2017, Freshworks Inc.’s products are trusted and used by over 100,000 businesses across the world. Some of the popular brands using Freshworks Inc.’s products include Avast, Quizup, Lenskart, Zoom, Zomato, Toshiba, TeamViewer amongst many others.
Speaking about the rebrand, Freshworks’s CEO Girish Mathrubootham says,
In 2010, we started Freshdesk as a “fresh” helpdesk with a dream to make a dent in the world of customer support. While Freshdesk continued to grow exponentially, we moved beyond customer service as a company by offering innovative products in the ITSM and CRM domains. As we expand our vision and build more exciting products, we felt that this was the right time to create a new brand that would allow us to tell our multi-story product story better. Today, I am happy to announce that we are rebranding the company as Freshworks.
Our goal is to build a company that is loved by employees, customers and shareholders. With Freshworks, we reaffirm our commitment to building a global product company from India.
This comes at a time when market players like Zoho from India, Zendesk, and Salesforce are fast expanding into new domains and looking to mature in newer markets. Freshdesk’s rebranding to Freshworks would give the company an even more powerful strategy to take on competitors with its huge suite of products.
Freshworks is currently valued at $700M and has offices in Chennai, London, US, Australia and Berlin. Freshworks has acquired as much as 7 startups in the past 18 months to enhance its suite of offerings. Hotline, Airwoot, Frilp are few popular names bought by Freshworks. Freshworks counts Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Google Capital and Accel Partners as its investors.
Disclaimer: The author worked as an intern with the Freshworks product marketing team a few months back. His stint at Freshworks has nothing to do with the reporting of this story.

Freshdesk 2 Cons For now, Freshdesk doesn’t have features on contract customers which could be helpful for some business since they can be warned if contracts are upOne of this solution's downsides, although minimal, is that emails can’t process first names easily 
Freshdesk AlternativesZendesk and Zoho Support are two of the main competitors for Freshdesk.
 
ZohoSupport is part of the Zoho application suite and addresses customer support needs of a business 

with a cloud based solution. It incorporates workflow automation and can be easily customized to match 

internal business process requirements. The product allows customers to contact on a variety of 

channels including voice, chat, email & social media. There are also analytic tools to monitor service 

performance with dashboards to view compliance with key support KPIs and metrics.
 
Freshdesk in comparison provides some additional features for customer support such as its “suggested 

solutions” which recommends resolutions based on an analysis of similar service issues. The product 

also supports service level agreements to define support metrics to be achieved, and this is incentivized 

for support agents through its gamification feature where they can compete to be rewarded for best 

support rendered on various performance metrics.
 
Zendesk on the other hand includes a knowledge base integrated with self service portals that 

customers can use to solve commonly faces problems and thereby improve resolution times. 

Additionally the product supports a community forum where discussions, posts and queries can be 

addressed in collaborative framework. There is also an App library where additional tools can be 

integrated to enhance the Zendesk product.

events on tickets based on configured rules. In addition the product can integrate customer support in 

different countries in one platform, as well as include multiple languages as needed.

You can have a separate incoming / outgoing email address for each product. (support(at)ProductA.com, support(at)ProductB.com etc.) 2. A separate customer portal for each product – eg. help.ProductA.com and help.ProductB.com 3. A completely different brand experience for customers in each portal – Fully customizable with separate logos, colors etc. 4. A separate top level forums and Solutions Category for each product / brand to keep only relevant information in each portal. 5. Ability to automatically link each ticket to the appropriate Product and appropriate support group in the backend. How much does this cost ? Multi-Product support is available in the Premium plan along with a host of other features and costs $29 per agent per month.Disclaimer – Microsoft, XBox and MS-Office are trademarks of Microsoft and are used here for illustrative purposes only.Microsoft currently does not use Freshdesk for customer support.Related postsPublic Ticket Links: Why sign up when you can just jump right in?!Building apps together for the Freshdesk marketplace Girish Mathrubootham   Founder & CEO of FreshworksSubscribe for blog updates      neteffects As I dwell on your old post everyday, I am really amazed with the things that I discover regarding the system and products that you offer.  Having a system that supports multiple products is like having a octopus hands that can do multi tasking work all at the same time.Pingback: Tennis Info Products - Infertility In Female.com | Infertility In Female.com()
