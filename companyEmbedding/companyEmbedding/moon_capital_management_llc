Free money fuels colleges’ expenditures

David MoonJuly 21, 2017Blog 
 

From 2000 to 2015, total expenditures by public U.S. colleges and universities increased 5.83 percent annually, more than twice the 2.15 percent increase in consumer prices. Don’t blame decreased public funding; federal funding of post-secondary education rose 3.84 percent annual in those years. Easy access to grants and student loans has disconnected the decision to pursue a college degree from the act of paying for it. Sellers can raise prices faster than consumers in an open market would allow, because a third party is paying part of the purchase price or the payment terms obfuscate the buyer’s ultimate responsibility. And … Read More







Recovery results mixed

David MoonJuly 14, 2017Blog 
 

An anniversary passed very quietly earlier this month, as the U.S. entered its ninth year since the end of the Great Recession in June 2009. This recovery is as unique as it is lengthy. The expansion, now 97 months long, is the third longest in U.S. history. Only a 10-year recovery that ended with the 2001 bursting of the internet bubble and a 106-month expansion in the 1960s were longer. As measured by growth in the Gross Domestic Product, however, this has been the weakest recovery in U.S. history. During the past eight years, the economy has averaged real annual … Read More







Knoxcare for uninsured locals?

David MoonJuly 7, 2017Blog 
 

As the stewards of our republic debate the next form of federal medical insurance, proponents of a government-sponsored, public option need not wait on Washington. They can put their positions into action immediately, with publicly-funded healthcare at the local, not national level. The city of Knoxville self-insures medical coverage for its employees, with premium split between employees (generally 75 percent) and taxpayers (25 percent.) Why not allow any city resident to pay the full premium and participate in the plan he already subsidizes? Most group plans don’t accept non-employees as participants, but the City self-insures, only hiring Blue Cross to … Read More







Millennials financially strapped

David MoonJune 30, 2017Blog 
 

I recently met Landon, an intern in the New York office one of the country’s most successful investment firms. Landon is 21 years old, grew up in a middle class southern family and thinks his future is on Wall Street. Despite his lofty career ambition, he also thinks that his foreseeable future is one of poverty. He currently lives in the equivalent of a closet with four other would-be masters of the universe, consuming a small fortune of his parents’ money for the privilege of spending the summer working 18-hour days for minimum wage. Landon is pretty good with numbers. … Read More







IS YOUR ADVISER LOOKING OUT FOR YOU?

David MoonJune 23, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon There are more conflicts of interest in the investment industry than most investors know, but a Department of Labor (DOL) “fiduciary requirement” regulation that went in effect on June 9 may provide some insight into whether your advisor has been recommending investments that benefit him rather than you. The new rule requires that recommendations made for IRAs or other retirement accounts be solely in the best interests of the client. It is embarrassing for the investment industry that such a rule is needed, but it is. Ameriprise Financial recently provided its brokers a list of 1,500 mutual … Read More







MISLEADING CEO PERFORMANCE

David MoonJune 17, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon When General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt announced on June 12 he was stepping down as the company’s CEO, he did so under fire from a number of shareholders for poor company performance during his tenure. However, Immelt’s time at GE juxtaposed against the performance of another high-profile CEO, Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, highlights the often misleading nature of executive performance. Immelt is considered a failure by many observers. Since taking over the reins from Jack Welch almost 17 years ago, the stock price has fallen from $48 per share to $29. If the job of management is to … Read More







Stock prices and earnings disconnected

David MoonJune 9, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon The NASDAQ Composite finally caught up with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, hitting multiple new highs in the past couple of weeks. The index records have some investors celebrating, some cautious and some outright concerned. They are all right. As someone whose business involves, to a large extent, owning shares of stock, record high stock prices is a good thing, both for our firm and our investors. But current index levels are vulnerable because of their disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Not all investors agree. “Technical investors” believe that stock prices adhere to the laws … Read More







Consumer strength misleading

David MoonJune 2, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon Headlines this past week heralded that Americans’ credit scores reached an all-time high in April, finally signaling a full and robust recovery from the recession of 2007-08. The average credit score is now 700, a level considered good-to-excellent. A full 60% of Americans now score at or above that influential figure. The average score in Tennessee is 666. The cause of these higher scores is misleading and the result of the higher scores could create problems. Chapter 10 bankruptcies fall out of your credit score calculation after ten years. The first wave of these bankruptcies and foreclosures … Read More







Risk is not volatility

David MoonMay 30, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon The investment industry has lied to you. Risk is not volatility. Investment risk is not standard deviation, beta or some other statistic masquerading as a Greek letter. Regardless of the how many fancy reports you’ve received stating otherwise, risk cannot be measured to two decimal places. Variability in the price of an investment, or group of investments, plays a role in one type of risk: the risk that you might be forced to liquidate an investment at an inopportune time. This is a risk faced by short sellers, those who invest with borrowed money, people who own … Read More







Other peoples’ money funds mistakes

David MoonMay 19, 2017Blog 
 

by David Moon Puerto Rico is broke and in default on $58 billion in debt. Its solution is to make payment on the loans in default with a sales tax revenue stream that is already committed as collateral for $15 billion of still performing loans. Lawsuits are flying, as Puerto Rican officials describe the dire consequences that will occur if it isn’t doesn’t breech existing bond covenants. Puerto Rico’s attempt to unilaterally divert collateral from one loan to another is the equivalent of trying to get multiple mortgages on your home and promising each lender a first lien. People go … Read More

Philosophy









Although misunderstood by much of the investment community, there is a distinction between the price and the value of an investment. Our job is to find that difference and profit from it.
Both our investment and business philosophies are based on the power of shared goals. We prefer companies where the executives’ incentives are aligned with those of the shareholders, most often investing their own money in company stock.
It also is important that your investment adviser’s incentives align with your best interests. That’s one reason we invest our money in the same stocks we purchase for our clients.
We sell no products, and we always use a third-party custodian for your account, providing an important check and balance on the safekeeping of your assets.
Our clients benefit from that accountability and commitment to a proven investment philosophy. That philosophy is built on four tenets: value, safety, research and logic.
“Sound investing can make you very wealthy if you’re not in too big of a hurry.
And it never makes you poor, which is better.”Benjamin Graham
Download one of our white papers or contact us to discuss your specific situation or questions.
DOWNLOADCONTACT USValue
In theory, the value of an investment is a simple number to calculate: it is the present value of all the cash a business will generate in the future. Our job is to project cash flows, determine probabilities and value those cash flows.
In practice, identifying profitable investment opportunities often is about exploiting the mistakes of others. As the renowned investor and founder of the Templeton Funds, Sir John Templeton, said, “If you want the same returns as everyone else, buy the same securities as everyone else.”
Independent thinking is required to make money in the financial markets. It is the greed and panic of others, chasing the same securities, that creates opportunities for investors who are willing to act independently. Our focus is on logic and research, not emotion and trends. Owning the investments most popular at any moment generates a false sense of safety and ensures that an investor will be subject to the whims of the investing masses. When given the choice, we prefer the regret of a lost opportunity over the regret of losing money. That’s why we always have been willing to stand outside the herd.
We look for value, not just what’s in vogue.
Research
Investors and advisers frequently rely on over-diversification as a replacement for knowledge. People who don’t know what to do often do a little bit of everything, giving the illusion of active management and eventually owning the entire market, either through index funds or their very expensive proxy – a collection of diversified mutual funds.
The beginning point of all sound investing is determining the value of the asset. Stocks are not numbers on a computer screen that fluctuate in price. They are ownership shares in a business. Successful investing requires examining a stock as if evaluating the business – because that is exactly what we are doing.
The business itself must be attractive. It must generate a high cash return on its invested capital.  We prefer companies that generate excess cash, not consume additional capital.
If the only way a business can generate increasing net income is to retain and reinvest a growing percentage of its earnings, we are not interested.
Sound investing requires vetting the value of the business, not just the price of the stock.
Safety
Our value approach to research and investing had its genesis in the 1920s with the work of Benjamin Graham, co-author of the bible of fundamental investment research, “Security Analysis.”
Graham describes a successful investment as one “which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”
Like Graham, we always are concerned about having a margin of safety in every investment.
This commitment to a margin of safety not only guides our investment decisions, but also is a part of our fiduciary responsibility to our clients.
Logic
At its core, successful investing is an act of logic that occurs in an environment of emotion.
Logic requires that our purchases are priced extremely low relative to their intrinsic value – which first requires that we determine the value of any investment we consider.
Being disciplined about the price we pay for a security provides the margin of safety we require.
Wall Street is an inefficient, emotional place – that’s why there are 10 or 20 percent daily swings in the prices of many stocks. Investors driven by emotion are afraid to stand out from the crowd. Whether they admit it or not, these investors – and they dominate the entire spectrum, from institutions to individuals – have ceded a part of their decision-making process to others.
At Moon Capital Management, our philosophy ensures that we don’t invest our clients’ money on the passing whims of the masses. Our approach often leads us to buy when others are selling and to sell when others are buying.
Some of our most profitable investments, the ones that only in hindsight seem so obvious and easy, are often the ones that required the most emotionally difficult decisions. To keep a rational outlook when the investing herd is panicking or irrationally euphoric is difficult – but can be extremely profitable.

To keep a rational outlook when the investing herd is panicking or irrationally euphoric is difficult – but can be extremely profitable.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
