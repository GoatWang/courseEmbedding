                The 4 Best Fidelity Funds for Growth Investors in 2016            


    By Richard Best | February 4, 2016 — 10:48 PM EST    






Share


















































After a dismal start to 2016, investors are rightly nervous about the prospects for growth stocks going forward. For those with a more positive outlook, the recent correction could be seen as a healthy reset of the sky-high valuations that accumulated over the last six years. This could set the stage for a nice bounce for beaten-down growth stocks. But other factors, such as rising interest rates, geopolitical eruptions and souring economies in China and Europe, could keep a lid on stock prices if corporate earnings do not pick up very soon. However, there are still opportunities for growth investors who find the right mix of funds that capture returns where they do occur. There is probably no better lineup of mutual funds than Fidelity’s to form a growth portfolio for 2016 and beyond.
Fidelity Contrafund
A top performer through most of the market cycles of the last 30 years, the Fidelity Contrafund is a solid core holding for growth investors for the next 25 years. It can be a bit more volatile than the S&P 500 Index, but this is one of the reasons it has outperformed the Index over the long term. The fund has returned 8.71% over the last 10 years and 12.7% over the last five years. Its largest holding is Berkshire Hathaway, which is always a market leader, and the bulk of its positions are in large-cap stocks it considers to be undervalued. As a top-performing actively managed fund, its expense ratio of 0.64% is very reasonable.
Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio
The health care sector is considered one of the best “all-weather” sectors that can perform well in any part of a market cycle. The Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio has been a solid performer in the sector and should continue to perform well as market conditions in the health care industry continue to strengthen. The fund is diversified across several segments of the industry, including biotech, pharmaceuticals and hospitals that are all benefiting from the changing demographics of an aging society. The fund also attempts to capture the changing demographics in foreign markets where people are beginning to demand higher quality medical services and more advanced technology. The fund has performed very well, returning 13.58% over the last 10 years and 23.7% over the last five years. For a top-performing, actively managed fund, its expense ratio of 0.74% is very reasonable.
Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio
For growth investors who may be leaning toward a defensive investment strategy, the Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio is a solid satellite holding for a shaky market. The fund invests a minimum of 80% of its assets in companies that manufacture or distribute consumer discretionary products and services. Stocks in this sector tend to fare better than the broader stock market during periods of market unrest. The fund has performed particularly well, returning 9.14% over the last 10 years and 14.31% over the last five years. Its expense ratio of 0.79% is considered below average for its category.
Fidelity Select Technology Portfolio
Another satellite holding for defensive posturing, the Fidelity Select Technology Portfolio targets a sector that should also perform well in 2016 and beyond. The fund invests primarily in companies involved in the development of products or processes that lead to significant technological advancements. Its top holdings include Apple; Alphabet, the parent of Google; Facebook; Yahoo; and Alibaba. The fund has a bit more volatility than the typical growth fund, but this is what gives it greater upside potential. The fund should only be used as a complement to a diversified growth stock portfolio. For long-term investors, it can produce results. It has returned 9.68% over the last 10 years and 10.66% over the last five years. Its expense ratio of 0.78% is considered low for its category.

Friess Small Cap Growth Fund
OverviewPerformanceFund AnalyticsOverviewBackground


Smaller companies played such a significant role in the early growth of Friess Associates that we concluded in 1982 that the small-cap category warranted specialized attention. For the next 35 years, the firm managed small-cap-only portfolios exclusively for institutions and high-net-worth individuals capable of meeting substantial investment minimums. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund makes our time-tested approach to investing in smaller companies widely available for the first time.

The Fund’s Adviser has contractually agreed, through at least May 31, 2018, to waive its management fees and/or pay Fund expenses. The net expense ratio reflects this limitation, while the gross expense ratio does not. Please refer to the Fund’s prospectus for additional information on the Fund’s expenses.


Fund Focus and Strategy


The small-cap category is a fruitful hunting ground for our approach because the core of our investment strategy is performing exhaustive research legwork to build a portfolio of underappreciated companies. Fewer Wall Street analysts follow smaller companies, which we believe contributes to one of the market’s most promising opportunities to outperform through in-depth research and analysis. We focus our efforts on isolating smaller companies poised for rapid earnings growth that sell at reasonable prices.
We interview companies of all sizes in our search for great smaller companies. We conduct all-cap research, meaning that our research into a small-cap company might also include its mid-cap supplier and large-cap customer. We believe taking a broader view that spans a company’s complete “food chain” positions us to uncover trends that point to opportunity or foreshadow trouble before they become obvious to managers whose focus is narrower.
Friess Small Cap Growth Fund capitalizes on the relationship between earnings performance and stock prices by holding companies experiencing above-average earnings growth that also show promise to exceed consensus earnings expectations. While the Fund’s market-cap characteristics reflect its small-cap focus, the portfolio’s sector weightings result from a true bottom-up, company-by-company approach and do not reflect the composition of any market index. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund aims to beat benchmarks, not mimic them.


Where This Fund May Fit As Part Of Your Asset Allocation


The Fund may be appropriate for your overall investment allocation if you are:

Looking to gain exposure to small-cap stocks
Seeking long-term growth of capital
Willing to accept short-term volatility of returns





Investors should carefully consider the Friess Small Cap Growth Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call (855) 656-3017 or visit www.friessfunds.com. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.




Risks
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund invests in small-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may also invest in depositary receipts, which are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities because their values depend on the performance of the underlying foreign securities. 




Friess Small Cap Growth Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC

The Fund is a newly registered mutual fund and does not have a full calendar year of performance as a mutual fund. Performance shown prior to May 31, 2017 is for Series B Units of the Friess Small Cap Trust (the “Predecessor Fund”), an unregistered Delaware Business Trust that commenced operations on August 6, 2002. The Predecessor Fund offered Series A and Series B Units. Performance is shown for Series B Units because Series B Units have been outstanding since inception of the Predecessor Fund. Returns for Series A Units, for the periods they were outstanding, would generally have been higher than returns for Series B Units. The Predecessor Fund was reorganized into the Fund by transferring all of the Predecessor Fund’s assets to the Fund in exchange for Institutional Class shares of the Fund on May 31, 2017, the date that the Fund commenced operations (the “Reorganization”). The Predecessor Fund has been managed in the same style as the Fund will utilize and by the same Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser. The Fund’s investment objective, policies, guidelines and restrictions are, in all material respects the same as those of the Predecessor Fund. At the time of the Reorganization the Predecessor Fund’s investment portfolio was managed by the same portfolio manager and team of investment professionals who will manage the Fund’s investment portfolio. 
The Predecessor Fund was not subject to certain investment restrictions, diversification requirements and other restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) or Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which, if they had been applicable, might have adversely affected the Predecessor Fund’s performance. After the Reorganization, the Fund’s performance will be calculated using the standard formula set forth in rules promulgated by the SEC, which differs in certain respects from the methods used to compute total return for the Predecessor Fund.

Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Jason Weiner

Jason, how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016?
The fund's share classes gained roughly 1%, significantly underperforming the 7.39% return of the Russell benchmark. To a much lesser degree, the fund also lagged the return of our peer group average.
Positioning in the health care sector was the main culprit the past year, especially choices in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences segment. This industry was the worst-performing group within the fund's benchmark, returning about -14% for the period. Names here struggled due to concerns about drug pricing and potential political investigation of pricing practices.
Our picks in technology also detracted considerably, most notably our positioning in some of the sector's heavy hitters. Our very large and helpful overweighting in Facebook (+10%) could not make up for the negative effects of underweightings in Microsoft (+15%) and Apple (+12%) – along with a zero-weighting in Nvidia (+134%) – three stocks that delivered unexpectedly robust results.

Tell us about your strategy the past year, including your approach to health care stocks.
When I look to invest in stocks within health care and other market sectors, I try to identify what I consider the "best of the best": the fast growers, usually industry leaders or companies with business models or product innovations that reinforce their earnings growth. My belief is that companies that can grow earnings faster than the market average should outperform over time.
I'm also interested in underappreciated growth stories. Such was the case with Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which I added to the fund in 2015 because I thought the market had undervalued its business. Unfortunately, this out-of-benchmark stock was overwhelmingly our largest relative detractor for the year, having lost half its value in a single day in March, and then declining further through period end. Allegations of improper sales practices at the firm and a sizable accounting error contributed to the stock's decline. Valeant had a greater reliance on drug-price increases than we had anticipated; this reliance hurt the firm's debt level and stock price. After concluding the stock's risks appeared to far outweigh any potential future upside, I sold our position.
Within biotech, I also tend to focus on firms with proven breakthrough therapies. To help limit the downside risk of a trial failure, I generally invest in biotech companies after they have reported compelling clinical success.
One example of a firm I've liked here is Gilead Sciences, which owns the leading HIV franchise and launched the industry's first highly effective, all-oral cure for hepatitis C. Gilead's Sovaldi® and Harvoni® are already the leading hep-C drugs on the market.
Nevertheless, Gilead (-28%) was another major detractor this period. One of the fund's largest positions, this stock was hurt by broad pricing pressure for biotechs and concern about increased competition and expectations for slowing growth for Gilead's hep-C treatments. I reduced the fund's position substantially during the period, as new demand for the company's drugs continued to disappoint.

Which other investments and decisions influenced results versus the benchmark?
Salesforce.com and Alphabet were sizable overweightings in the fund, so when their share prices lagged the market, they ended up among our largest relative detractors for 2016. This was a surprising result given that both firms executed well on their business plans.
Salesforce gained market share in enterprise sales and increased earnings per share by 30% during the year, but its share price returned roughly -13%. Alphabet, one of the fund's largest holdings and the leader in web search and machine learning, increased both sales and earnings by more than 20% last year, but its stock gained only 2%.
By year end, I had reduced the fund's salesforce stake by about half. I also reduced our position in Alphabet, although to a much lesser extent.
Picks in real estate also detracted. Here, Realogy Holdings was a notable negative, with our shares returning -29% this period. Realogy – via such well-known brands as Coldwell Banker, ERA Real Estate and Sotheby's – is the largest domestic real estate broker by value, transacting roughly 25% of all home sales in the U.S., excluding for-sale-by-owner homes and new-construction sales. The housing market has been slowly recovering from its 2008 lows, and I liked the business's cash-flow characteristics. I also found the firm's growth prospects compelling.
However, the stock suffered amid consecutive quarters of disappointing financial results. The stock tumbled further in August when Realogy cited a stronger U.S. dollar and increased market volatility as factors hampering its performance. I thought Realogy's growth prospects remained compelling, so I more than doubled our stake given what I saw as an attractive price.

Where did you find success?
The fund's biggest relative contributor during the past year was biopharmaceutical firm Medivation, which I overweighted during the first half of the year. The fund held both Medivation and Astellas, which together own the rights to Xtandi®, a prostate-cancer drug whose clinical trials proved its superior effectiveness. Medivation shares began to rise in March after the firm released positive fourth-quarter earnings, including strong sales growth for Xtandi. In August, pharma giant Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation at a premium. The deal was completed in September, benefiting the fund.
Elsewhere, Facebook was by far the fund's largest holding and also a significant contributor. To me, Facebook's exposure to the revolution in internet advertising through social media has been a compelling competitive advantage. Since its initial public offering in 2012, Facebook's rapid growth has been fueled by the introduction of ads into its mobile newsfeed, along with a series of technology upgrades that empowered advertisers to target customers with greater precision. More than 1 billion people view Facebook daily on their phones or computers.
Shares gained 10% for the year on the strength of the company's revenue from mobile advertising, higher sales of video advertisements and ads on its Instagram mobile application. As the stock's price appreciated, I sold some of our position to lock in profits, although it remained our largest position at period end.

Jason, what is your outlook?At the end of December, the big question is how the recent U.S. presidential election will affect the economy and markets. There is a lot of uncertainty amid few specifics on President Donald Trump's prospective legislative path. However, a peeling back of the most stringent regulations of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act – legislation passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis of 2008 – could support lending and mortgage-finance firms. A cut in the corporate tax rate also could be a positive for the economy. ■






Jason Weiner discusses machine learning:


"Throughout the past year, tech firms have continued to roll out powerful new innovations, which I've found leads to growth. In particular, I've been bullish on the recent rise of machine learning – a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to adapt and change without being explicitly programmed. This technology is being used in a number of ways. In past reports, I've discussed Alphabet (and it's main operating division, Google) in terms of online advertising, but the firm is also a preeminent player in the machine-learning field. 
"In May, the firm unveiled Google Assistant – a computerized personal assistant that will be available on Google smartphones and Google Now, the firm's smart wireless speaker. The technology stands out from competition in that it can engage in two-way conversations with its user, using Google's natural-language processing algorithm. Alphabet was the fund's second-largest position during the period.
"Facebook also uses this technology – through chatbots designed to simulate conversation with human users on its Messenger application. Chatbots can assist with customer service and small transactions. Throughout the year, the firm continued to make improvements to the system. As of November, 33,000 of the firm's developers had written 34,000 chatbots for the app.
"Another popular use of machine-learning tech is in self-driving cars. One way I've invested here is through our stake in Mobileye. Mobileye is an Israeli firm that develops vision-based advanced-driver-assistance systems providing warnings for collision prevention." 



Key Takeaways



The fund's share classes gained roughly 1% for the year ending December 31, 2016, significantly underperforming the 7.39% gain of the benchmark Russell 3000® Growth Index.

Versus the benchmark, our choices in the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences segment were hit hard by concerns about drug pricing. Our picks in the information technology sector also detracted considerably.

The fund's non-index stake in Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International was far and away the fund's largest relative detractor. The fund held a position in Valeant through the first half of the reporting period, as Portfolio Manager Jason Weiner considered the business to be undervalued.

At period end, Jason believes economic and market uncertainty has been heightened by the recent U.S. presidential election; however, some potential legislative reforms could prove positive for certain market sectors.





MARKET RECAP


The S&P 500® index returned 11.96% in 2016, rising sharply on post-election optimism for economic growth. The year began during a fairly volatile stretch, with stocks hampered by persistent oil-price weakness and U.S.-dollar strength. Markets regained momentum in February amid U.S. job gains, a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly seven-year uptrend intact. Markets tumbled briefly following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to exit the European Union – dubbed "Brexit" – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of all-time highs. For the year, energy (+27%) led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices, one in the spring and another in November. Telecommunication services (+23%) was close behind, as demand for dividend-paying equities was high early in the period. Cyclical sectors, including financials (+22%), industrials (+18%) and materials (+17%), also posted strong gains. Conversely, consumer staples (+5%) and consumer discretionary (+6%) lagged the index, the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brick-and-mortar retailers. Real estate (+3%) struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates, while health care (-2%) was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.



Performance Summary

Variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the insurer. The value of a variable annuity contract depends on the values of units of subaccounts of the separate account. Each subaccount purchases shares of a corresponding mutual fund. Subaccount investment performance is based on the performance of the mutual fund in which it invests, less insurance company charges made against the assets of the separate account. A subaccount is not a mutual fund. 
The information provided in this Performance Summary contains performance information for the fund, or class, and each variable subaccount, with comparisons over different time periods to the fund's relevant benchmarks – including an appropriate index as well as a group of similar funds whose average returns are compiled and monitored by an independent mutual fund research company. Figures for more than one year assume a steady compounded rate of return and are not a class' year-by-year results, which fluctuated over the periods shown. Fund performance numbers are net of all underlying fund operating expenses, but do not include any insurance charges imposed by your insurance company's separate account. If fund performance information included the effect of these additional charges, the total returns would have been lower. The performance table also contains performance information for certain insurance company subaccounts that invest in the fund. Each variable subaccount's performance, as shown, is net of all fees and expenses, including those charges imposed by your insurance company. Seeing the returns over different time periods can help you assess the performance against relevant measurements and across multiple market environments. The performance information includes average annual total returns and cumulative total returns and is further explained in this section.*
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss – investment returns, contract value, and, for variable income annuities, payment amounts are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted below. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. For month-end performance figures, please visit www.fidelity.com/annuityperformance or call Fidelity. The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

Read this important informationPerformance represents average annual total returns, assumes the reinvestment of all distributions and reflects applicable sales charges. Total returns reflect a waiver of part of each Fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower. Average annual total returns illustrate the annual compounded returns that would have produced the cumulative total return if each Fund’s performance had remained constant throughout the period indicated. Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.Expense RatiosExpense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. The difference between gross and net operating expenses reflects contractual fee waivers. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more detail. Expense ratios for Nationwide Bond Fund, Nationwide Government Bond Fund, Nationwide HighMark Bond Fund, Nationwide HighMark Small Cap Core Fund and Nationwide U.S. Small Cap Value Fund have been restated to reflect the reduction of contractual advisory fees effective May 1, 2017.

The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.© 2017 Morningstar.  All Rights Reserved.  The information contained herein:  (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely.

Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai

Charlie, how did the fund perform for the year ending December 31, 2016?
The fund's share classes gained roughly 11%, trailing the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index and falling just behind the 11.96% return of the broader S&P 500®. However, the fund outpaced its peer group average.
Considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors weighed on the fund's relative results in the first six months of the year, penalizing my emphasis on growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries, and secondarily on cyclically sensitive stocks with improving fundamentals.
In the second half of the year, investors grew less defensive and focused more on company fundamentals. This "risk-on" attitude helped a number of the fund's holdings, particularly in the semiconductor space, where stock choices and an overweighting jointly made that industry easily our largest contributor. Positioning in systems software also added value.

Specifically, where did the fund run into problems versus the MSCI sector index?
Stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on relative results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing.
The first group was home to the fund's largest detractor, China-based online advertising provider 58.com. This out-of-benchmark stock was hurt by selling pressure related to the company's purchase of privately held rival Ganji.com, as well as the challenges of integrating Ganji and other recent acquisitions. Additionally, 58.com issued disappointing revenue guidance in November. Recently imposed regulations by local Chinese governments intended to curb real estate speculation – including higher down-payment requirements – played a part in the firm lowering expectations for property-related advertising on its platform.
I continued to believe in the longer-term prospects for this stock, as I saw it as a potential beneficiary of the growth of China's middle class, one of the broader themes I keep my eye on. For risk-management purposes, I reduced this position somewhat but retained most of it at period end.
Also detracting was an overweighting in electric automaker Tesla Motors, among the fund's top-10 holdings at period end. After hitting a high for the year in early April, the stock consolidated somewhat below that level for the remainder of the period. Investors remained cautious amid the company's recurring production problems and its decision to purchase solar panel maker SolarCity. With that said, Tesla increased production by an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016, and I believe the firm's rapidly increasing market share could alleviate many of its growing pains.
Finally, I'll mention untimely ownership of an out-of-benchmark position in DeNA, a Japan-based provider of online gaming and e-commerce services. Although the stock rose for the year overall, I increased our position here in December shortly before the share price dropped on allegations of inaccurate, plagiarized articles on Welq, its website for health care information. I continued to like DeNA because of the company's joint venture with Nintendo to support the latter's development of a mobile game platform. The first entry for this platform was the highly anticipated Super Mario Run, released in mid-December. Other games are already in the pipeline.
Overall, the fund's holdings of foreign stocks were a drawback this period amid the U.S. dollar's strong appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2016.

What about contributors?
A large overweighting in semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group was the fund's largest relative contributor, with our position rising 58% this period. The company attracted activist investors and went through a major restructuring process with new management. I considerably reduced this position as the stock advanced, taking profits along the way. 
Overweighting Micron Technology – a maker of DRAM, NAND flash and other kinds of digital memory – also stood out for its positive impact on our relative results. I increased this position as the shares fell to a mid-single-digit price-earnings (P/E) ratio early in 2016 – well below the broader market's P/E ratio. Based on my expectations for Micron's earnings in 2016, I thought this was far too pessimistic. This turned out to be a good call, as the stock enjoyed a sustained rally from mid-May through the end of December. I reduced this position, too, given the robust gains it delivered.
A non-benchmark stake in Japan-based Sumco, a producer of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers, proved timely as well. After a cyclical downturn for wafer demand and pricing depressed the stock in the first half of 2016, the supply-demand balance began to normalize in the second half of the year, leading to expectations of better pricing for wafer companies. I established a stake here in August. These developments helped our position post a 59% return for the period.

What is your outlook as of period end?While I expect global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, I am optimistic about longer-term trends for the major themes I've identified, such as cloud computing, software as a service (SaaS), big data, artificial intelligence and the "Internet of Things."
Over the past decade, services, internet and software companies have been steadily taking market share from hardware firms. The cloud and SaaS are better value propositions for customers. The advantages include smoothing capital expenditures, rationalizing hardware costs, eliminating the need to manage IT infrastructure and keeping clients on the cutting edge of technology.
More recently, we have witnessed the significant development of artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications such as image and voice recognition. This development has been driven by the vast amount of data collected in many internet-based applications, the material improvement in machine-learning algorithms and the significant reduction in unit computing costs.
I believe we are in the early to middle innings of this and many other paradigm shifts in the tech sector. Similar to the mainframe and client-server eras, I believe big shifts in profit pools and market capitalization are possible, and my goal is to monitor these changes closely and position the fund to take advantage of them. ■






Charlie Chai on opportunities in international tech companies:


"Consistent with my longstanding strategy, I continue to look for new ideas in the international markets, where many companies are undiscovered or underfollowed by research analysts. I believe these markets are a source of compelling growth opportunities.
"For example, in the consumer segment, internet services and e-commerce companies remain attractive growers, especially those that sit at the intersection of the social, mobile and local themes. In Asian markets – especially China, South Korea and Japan – these industries have generally seen a pace of innovation as fast as, if not faster than, their Western peers. This pace has been driven by a less intrusive regulatory environment and incumbent companies in certain industries that are much less mature.
"Internet finance is another area of rapid growth. Consumer credit offerings have very low penetration in markets such as China. And in Southeast Asia, smartphone adoption has started to resemble growth trends seen in China three years ago. I believe considerable long-term value will be created in this region.
"After a period of significant capital inflows, we've seen a recent decline in corporate fundraising activity, which I believe is very positive for existing internet companies because it means higher barriers to entry and less competition." 



Key Takeaways



The fund's share classes gained roughly 11% for the year ending December 31, 2016, lagging the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index.

Growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries favored by Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai struggled early in the year amid considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors.

Versus the MSCI sector index, stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing. Conversely, stock choices and an overweighting in semiconductors contributed most, while positioning in systems software also added value.

Although Charlie expects global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, he's optimistic about longer-term prospects for the major themes he's identified.





MARKET RECAP


The S&P 500® index returned 11.96% in 2016, rising sharply on post-election optimism for economic growth. The year began during a fairly volatile stretch, with stocks hampered by persistent oil-price weakness and U.S.-dollar strength. Markets regained momentum in February amid U.S. job gains, a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly seven-year uptrend intact. Markets tumbled briefly following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to exit the European Union – dubbed "Brexit" – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of all-time highs. For the year, energy (+27%) led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices, one in the spring and another in November. Telecommunication services (+23%) was close behind, as demand for dividend-paying equities was high early in the period. Cyclical sectors, including financials (+22%), industrials (+18%) and materials (+17%), also posted strong gains. Conversely, consumer staples (+5%) and consumer discretionary (+6%) lagged the index, the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brick-and-mortar retailers. Real estate (+3%) struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates, while health care (-2%) was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.



Performance Summary

Variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the insurer. The value of a variable annuity contract depends on the values of units of subaccounts of the separate account. Each subaccount purchases shares of a corresponding mutual fund. Subaccount investment performance is based on the performance of the mutual fund in which it invests, less insurance company charges made against the assets of the separate account. A subaccount is not a mutual fund. 
The information provided in this Performance Summary contains performance information for the fund, or class, and each variable subaccount, with comparisons over different time periods to the fund's relevant benchmarks – including an appropriate index as well as a group of similar funds whose average returns are compiled and monitored by an independent mutual fund research company. Figures for more than one year assume a steady compounded rate of return and are not a class' year-by-year results, which fluctuated over the periods shown. Fund performance numbers are net of all underlying fund operating expenses, but do not include any insurance charges imposed by your insurance company's separate account. If fund performance information included the effect of these additional charges, the total returns would have been lower. The performance table also contains performance information for certain insurance company subaccounts that invest in the fund. Each variable subaccount's performance, as shown, is net of all fees and expenses, including those charges imposed by your insurance company. Seeing the returns over different time periods can help you assess the performance against relevant measurements and across multiple market environments. The performance information includes average annual total returns and cumulative total returns and is further explained in this section.*
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss – investment returns, contract value, and, for variable income annuities, payment amounts are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted below. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. For month-end performance figures, please visit www.fidelity.com/annuityperformance or call Fidelity. The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

Our Mission
Our mission is to improve the way startup employees are paid by unlocking the value of their equity compensation in a way that benefits all key players: the shareholder, the company, and the investor. Employees should have the opportunity to share in the value they create for their company's shareholders. This must be accomplished in a manner that keeps the focus on company growth, the number one priority for all stakeholders. Investors that previously couldn't access late-stage private companies due to investment minimums, can now invest in private growth companies.








EquityZen connects shareholders of private companies with investors seeking alternative investments. We deliver value to shareholders, companies, and investors alike at the highest level of excellence.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!
                        

S.S.
Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options

If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

            Private placement investments are NOT bank deposits (and thus NOT insured by the FDIC or by any other federal governmental agency), are NOT guaranteed by EquityZen Securities, and MAY lose value.

            Offers to sell, or the solicitations of offers to buy, any security can only be made through official offering documents that contain important information about risks, fees and expenses.
            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.
