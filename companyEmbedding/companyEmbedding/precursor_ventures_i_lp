Charles Hudson | AccompanyCharles HudsonManaging Partner at Precursor VenturesBIOGRAPHYCharles HudsonPrecursor VenturesGoogle PlusSpeakerwomen 2.0About.mePrecursor VenturesFounders DenCVSoftTech VCKloutLanyrdAngelListOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherOtherI am a Venture Partner at SoftTech VC and the CEO and Co-Founder of Bionic Panda Games , a mobile games company based in San Francisco, CA. Until February 2010, I was the VP of Business Development for Serious Business, a leading producer of social games for the social web. Zynga acquired Serious Business in February of 2010. In addition to working at Serious Business, I also produce technology conferences focused on the intersection of gaming and social media. The two flagship conferences we produce are the Virtual Goods Summit and the Social Gaming Summit . I also work with Justin Smith from Inside Social Games / Inside Facebook on a series of research reports on the virtual goods market. You can check out our research at I nside Virtual Goods . Prior to joining Serious Business, I was the Sr. Director for Business Development at Gaia Online, a leading online hangout for teens and young adults. Prior to Gaia, I worked in New Business Development at Google and focused on new partnership opportunities for early-stage products in the advertising, mobile, and e-commerce markets. Prior to joining Google, I was a Product Manager for IronPort Systems, a leading provider of anti-spam hardware appliances that was acquired by Cisco Systems for $830 million in 2007. I spent several years working at In-Q-Tel, the strategic venture capital group for the Central Intelligence Agency. While at In-Q-Tel, I focused on identifying investment opportunities that could deliver significant value to the CIA and the commercial market in both the short and long term.I hold an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a B.A. in Economics and Spanish from Stanford University. I am also on the Advisory Board for BizWorld, a nonprofit that educates students about business, and the MIT/Stanford Venture Lab, a nonprofit connecting entrepreneurs, ideas, and capital.
