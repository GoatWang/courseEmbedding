Governance, Stewardship and responsible investment
The integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into our investment process is an important component of our Focus on Change investment philosophy. We have two dedicated teams, with distinct skill sets, that provide our investment teams with expert knowledge on the material ESG issues for our clients.




Governance and Stewardship
The Governance and Stewardship team focuses on the structure and composition of boards, the skills required to run effective boards, remuneration, our stewardship responsibilities, voting, and governance thought leadership.

>





Responsible Investment
Our Responsible Investment team focuses on the environmental and social performance of our investments.  Our focus can be captured into four areas of human rights, employment issues, business ethics & the community and the environment.  This team also oversees these aspects in relation to our dedicated Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) and Ethical Investment products and services.

Multi-asset capabilities
Successfully managing a variety of multi-asset portfolios demands an exceptionally broad and skilled investment capability. At Standard Life Investments, we have extensive experience and diversity of talent across all global asset classes – including equities, fixed income, real estate, money markets and private equity.

Investment Expertise



Equities

Standard Life Investments manages a full range of equity strategies that span the risk/return spectrum. While distinct in their risk tolerances and return objectives, our equity portfolios share a common goal: to consistently add value through active management.





Fixed income

Standard Life Investments offers fixed income capabilities across a wide range of sub-sectors and geographies. Our commitment to the asset class is underlined by the extensive range of fixed income strategies we have developed to meet the needs of both existing and new clients.





Real estate

The benefits of investing in real estate are compelling. Over the long term, the returns from real estate have a low correlation with equities and bonds. This means that real estate can help to spread risk and create diversified investment portfolios. In addition, real estate offers relatively stable income in the form of rent paid by tenants.





Multi-asset

Standard Life Investments is at the forefront of multi-asset investing, developing innovative products that aim to deliver targeted returns within tight risk boundaries. As a result, increasing numbers of investors trust us with their investments.

Real estate capabilities
The benefits of investing in real estate are compelling. Over the long term, the returns from real estate have a low correlation with equities and bonds. This means that real estate can help to spread risk and create diversified investment portfolios. In addition, real estate offers relatively stable income in the form of rent paid by tenants.
At Standard Life Investments, we are passionate about real estate and driven by a desire to maximise returns for our clients. Our real estate history goes back over 50 years and in that time we have gathered significant experience and global scale. As a result, we are now one of the 20 largest managers of real estate pension assets in the world*. In total, we manage real estate assets worth $18.2 billion**. With operations in six locations globally, we also have vital local knowledge and access to some of the best investment opportunities.
The scale of our business means we can invest across the real estate spectrum and offer a distinctive range of real estate portfolios. For example, investors can choose between direct (bricks and mortar), listed (companies listed on stock exchanges) and hybrid (combination of both) real estate portfolios that cover both domestic and global markets.
Within each portfolio, we work hard to optimise performance. In terms of direct real estate, for example, we continually appraise and actively manage each asset. This is possible through a team of more than 120 dedicated real estate professionals that provide expertise in all aspects of commercial real estate, including development and asset management. Therefore, when you invest in our real estate portfolios, you can rest assured that we are doing everything possible to help achieve your investment goals.

It creates a clear forward-looking strategic direction for all of our investment decisions, particularly asset allocation within the traditional balanced funds but it also underpins our absolute return strategies. The House View is formed by the Global Investment Group (GIG) on the basis of internal research from the Global Strategy Team, covering a range of macro-economic, behavioural, liquidity and structural drivers in each of the major economies and markets.

July 2017
The following portfolio is based upon a global investor with access to all the major asset classes.
If you prefer, you can access a text-only version of our house view.




Government bonds




US Treasuries
Tighter labour markets and rising wages give the Federal Reserve the rationale to continue tightening policy. Markets are not fully pricing in inflation pressures.
Moved to LIGHT


European Bonds
Bonds are not as well supported, as the improvement in economic growth could force the ECB into tightening policy while political pressures could resurface. Markets, however, are over-pricing inflationary pressures. 
LIGHT


UK Gilts
The Bank of England has delivered significant easing measures as the impact of rising inflation on household incomes should cause the economy to slow. Long-term valuations are expensive, especially after the recent sterling moves.
NEUTRAL


Japanese Bonds
The central bank is attempting to reflate the economy with its quantitative easing and yield curve control policy alongside negative short-term rates. The absence of yield makes this asset class relatively unattractive.
LIGHT


Global Inflation-Linked Debt
While we see inflation as generally well contained globally, there are varying opportunities in different markets. In particular, UK breakeven rates look relatively high and US rates relatively low.
NEUTRAL


Global Emerging Market Debt
Local currency yields are more attractive due to emerging markets sensitivity to the pick-up in global growth. US dollar-denominated debt is supported by attractive spreads over Treasury debt.
HEAVY




Back to top

 



Corporate bonds




Investment Grade Debt
QE supports UK bonds, but it has driven European yields to unattractive levels. US credit spreads are less attractive as Treasury yields increase and we prefer riskier assets.
LIGHT


High Yield Debt
The hunt for yield has driven investors to this asset class, although overcrowding remains a risk in some sectors, especially in the US when monetary policy is being tightened or oil prices are under pressure. 
NEUTRAL




Back to top

 



Equities




US Equities
Equities have rallied on the back of improved global economic conditions and potential fiscal easing and deregulation. While dividends and buybacks are supportive, risks valuations are fairly full.
HEAVY


European Equities
Corporate earnings are improving on the back of a widespread pick-up in economic growth across the region, while investor sentiment becomes more positive. Concerns remain over some banking systems and the lack of strong credit growth.
HEAVY


Japanese Equities
The market looks more attractive, as easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus for 2017 are helped by efforts to improve corporate governance, share buybacks and business investment.
NEUTRAL


UK Equities
The UK economy is weakening and Brexit remains a longer-term threat. Sterling remains the primary driver of the relative attractiveness of UK companies with overseas exposure.
NEUTRAL


Developed Asian Equities
The improvement in the global economy supports this market, but Chinese tightening risks curbing property demand, which is a large driver for the region.
NEUTRAL


Emerging Market Equities
While emerging markets are attractive in the face of a global economic pick-up, the current Chinese tightening bias makes us Neutral on this asset class.
NEUTRAL




Back to top

 



Real estate




UK
The UK real estate cycle is at a mature stage and expectations of further capital growth are limited. Income remains attractive, although risks are elevated should conditions turn recessionary or political uncertainty persists.
NEUTRAL


European
European property continues to perform well in a global context. Yield compression is essentially over as spreads have tightened, while stronger economic growth and low levels of supply are supporting healthy income growth.
HEAVY


North American
The US market has low vacancies across most sectors and markets, with the notable exception of retail malls, and construction is mostly in check, providing a prolonged window for rental growth.
HEAVY


Asia Pacific
An attractive yield margin remains but yields have bottomed in most markets. Income returns are driven by modest rental growth on the back of low vacancy, healthy tenant demand and resilient economies.
NEUTRAL




Back to top

 



Other assets




Foreign Exchange
Better global growth tends to encourage flows out of the US dollar. The euro is no longer a sell, while the yen is cheap. Sterling acts as a shock absorber for Brexit.
Heavy ¥, Neutral $, €, £


Global Commodities
While global growth generally supports commodities, they are very sensitive to Chinese policy and some commodities, particularly oil, face excess supply.
NEUTRAL




Back to top

 



Cash




With global yields still extremely low, we still see better opportunities in risk assets.
LIGHT

Key issues
The global economy continues to expand, as shown by positive trends in trade, capital spending and hiring, helped by still supportive monetary and fiscal policies. While central banks in the US, Canada and China are raising interest rates, and QE programmes should be restrained in the US and Europe into 2018, it is clear that central banks will be cautious in their monetary tightening. Underlying inflation pressures look restrained by the degree of spare capacity as well as the impact of technological developments. Political risk remains high in most regions, summarised by the degree of uncertainty about whether the US government pushes ahead with material changes to tax, trade or foreign policies. 
We balance a desire for selected growth opportunities with a focus on sustainable yield. As the profits outlook appears better, we have accepted more equity risk. US stocks appear well supported, especially if the government lowers corporate taxes, albeit they command high valuations. Europe, Japan and selected emerging markets look set to benefit from higher operating leverage to global growth. 
Among the major currencies, we have a small overweight position in the Japanese yen and small underweight positions in the US dollar and sterling. This is partly on valuation grounds and partly to act as diversifiers – for example, the yen usually benefits when investor uncertainty falls.
Elsewhere, the House View remains overweight in income-producing assets such as real estate and emerging market debt. We expect only modest returns from government bonds in 2017, although the downside is limited by the lack of major inflation pressure. Valuations on corporate bonds have become stretched. 
In real estate, we find better opportunities outside the UK. In the US and Europe, yields are attractive, rental growth is positive and commercial development remains constrained. Meanwhile, there are some decent prospects in parts of Asia. Property combines yield with some growth, which is a 'sweet spot' in terms of investment preferences. 
Where foresight meets conviction
Whatever your involvement in the financial markets, you will understand that they present ongoing, never-ending challenges. That’s why we’re focused firmly on the future - anticipating and identifying the next compelling investment opportunities for our clients. 
Our House View provides a clear, forward-looking strategic direction for our investment decisions. It’s the crux of all our investment insights, taking into account the many factors that shape the outlook for the major asset classes. It ensures we have a consistent approach to managing market risk across our product range, and acts as a bedrock for the decisions our investment teams take on a daily basis.

How the process works




The Global Investment Group is the team that collates our House View. After in-depth analysis, the GIG forms a broad view of asset allocation, based on current market drivers and economic forecasts. Across our portfolios, we describe our positions within markets, sectors and stocks as being Very Heavy, Heavy, Neutral, Light and Very Light, relative to the portfolio's benchmark.

Thematic House View

When forecasting real estate performance, as well as making top-down allocation decisions, many asset managers consider two main factors – geography and asset type. However, a number of additional, more thematic factors can differentiate returns and bring another important dimension to top-down allocation. In theory, thematic factors are infinite but they can include the dominance of the asset (size), lease length, covenant strength, asset quality (flexibility/specification/sustainability) and location. While defining these factors can divide opinion on the classification of an asset, what is clear is that at different points in the cycle they have a material impact on performance. In this paper, we use the UK commercial real estate market to assess how these factors can, if harnessed properly, help to deliver enhanced performance and improve decision making.

From UK Mutual Life Insurer to Global Investment Company – Standard Life’s transformation

At Standard Life Investments, we increasingly encounter real interest from existing and prospective insurance clients around the globe as to how we achieved this transformation. In this paper, we document that journey.

Populism and the threat to Globalisation

We live in an era of globalisation. And an era of increased income inequality. Are the two linked? And are they the driver behind the rise of populist parties in Europe, the election of President Trump, Brexit? In this paper we explore these issues alongside the social and cultural changes that have happened in tandem. We consider the implications for the future of globalisation and for markets.

The Investment Challenges of Decumulation, Part 2

Following on from our paper 'The Investment Challenges of a Decumulation World',  this second paper explores further the investment aspects of the decumulation challenge. In particular, it seeks to illustrate: – the substantial added value of a multi-asset growth approach to savings in retirement compared with passive equity, even after fees and – whether there is a single ‘drawdown’ level that is appropriate for all.

The impact of slowing working-age population growth

The developed world is at a turning point – growth in the working-age population has peaked, economies are slowing, and voters are displaying scepticism for immigration. This raises questions over how economies can grow without more people of working age to wield a shovel or tap a keyboard. In turn, this has implications for real estate and the number of new buildings needed in the future. In this paper, we focus on the economic and commercial real estate impacts of slowing growth in the working-age population.

Lower For Longer

With future investment returns likely to be lower than previously enjoyed, what can investors do to increase returns. This paper suggests if market beta contributes less to overall returns than before,  alpha will become an ever more important return component .

Impact investing

Impact investing – once a niche corner of the market – has entered the mainstream. This has been driven by increasing awareness among investors of the important role they can play in order to help address the world’s many environmental and social challenges. Impact investing allows them to meet this desire – while still seeking a financial return. This paper looks at the various types of impact investing, how it is measured and what lies ahead for this compelling proposition.

The benefits of growth with lower volatility

In this paper, we look at some ways of managing volatility and demonstrate how the inclusion of a low-volatility growth strategy can provide a superior overall solution.

Leisure in the UK Retail Environment

As the digital era has made shopping more convenient for consumers, the need for retailers to deliver a unique physical shopping experience is increasingly important. Leisure (including food & beverage, cinemas and entertainment) has a significant role to play in this ever-demanding retail landscape. In the latest paper from our real estate research team, we examine leisure’s growth as part of a retail offering and seek to establish whether there is a clear link with rental growth. In doing so, we investigate leisure’s influence on both shopping centre assets and major UK town centres.

Forward-Looking Scenario Analysis

Historical stress testing is now an established approach to tail-risk management. However, there is less consensus on how best to undertake forward-looking scenario analysis. This paper examines how we might incorporate expert opinions into projections of portfolio outcomes. We also illustrate that using a diversified multi-asset approach can help mitigate losses in such extreme market scenarios.

Food Security in China

China is the world’s most populous country. As such, issues around food production are of paramount importance. This extends to the environmental and social risks associated with the food industry. These include water scarcity, pollution and food safety standards.

Shopping for opportunities in UK retail

The UK retail sector remains under pressure following years of neglect and mismanagement, poor economic conditions and the rise of online retailing. However, the short-term prognosis for the retail sector currently looks better than it has done for some time. The UK is enjoying a reasonably robust economic backdrop, consumer confidence is buoyant and disposable incomes are improving.  Against this backdrop, selecting the right assets in the best areas is vital. In this paper, we examine the current state of the UK retail sector and provide proprietary analysis on where we see the best opportunities and those areas to avoid.

Considering ESGP For Emerging Market Sovereigns

A country’s creditworthiness is fundamentally dependent on its competitiveness and ability to sustain economic growth over the long term. To assess this, investors traditionally look at a range of macroeconomic variables, including public debt, inflation, fiscal deficits and current account balances. Along with political and governance factors, these are enablers of economic development and elements of the country’s willingness and ability to repay its debt.

Managing a Matching Adjustment Portfolio

The Solvency II Directive codifies and harmonises EU insurance regulation. The directive, in force since 1 January 2016, relates primarily to the amount of capital insurers within the EU must hold in order to reduce insolvency risk. The purpose of this paper will be to examine, from an investment manager's perspective, how EU insurers can use Solvency II's Matching Adjustment (MA) provisions. The MA provides insurers with a capital efficient mechanism for holding eligible long-term assets to match eligible life or annuity insurance obligations.

The Rise of the Millennials

The financial industry and the products it supplies have always evolved to meet market challenges and opportunities. Today is no different. One of the key factors that will drive the industry over the coming years is the rise in prominence of the so-called Millennials (also known as Generation Y). This is the generation born between the early 1980s and 2000. The expectations and values of this tech-savvy group differ from those that have gone before them, most notably when it comes to social, economic and environmental issues.

Solvency II & Absolute Return Investing

In this paper, we examine the important implications of Solvency II, the latest European Union Directive designed to harmonise insurance regulation across member states. In particular, we highlight how the risk-based nature of the Directive, together with its 'look-through' requirement, confirms the underlying risk efficiency of well-diversified absolute strategies.  We also show how these strategies can be used to improve capital-efficient returns.

The Investment Challenges of a Decumulation World

The 2014 reforms set out in the Budget provide UK pension savers with  significantly greater freedom than they have had to date. The reforms  are likely to have major implications for DC scheme investment strategies — in particular for the lifestyle strategies adopted, and for individuals’ investment choices regarding the post retirement period. In this paper, we examine some of these challenges. To do this, we model different investment strategies using historical financial and economic data, to determine the impact on member outcomes and the certainty of achieving these.
