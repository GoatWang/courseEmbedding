Memo to Eliot Spitzer: If Even Harvard’s Own Law Firm is More Loyal to Bain, How Can You Get Good Legal Advice?
Posted on July 30, 2013  by  Yves Smith


A commenter in our prior “Memo to Spitzer”  post questioned whether big private equity firms could really be getting away with scamming their investors, arguing that:
…firms are under more scrutiny than ever these days by LPs (and their attorneys) since the financial crisis. Everything is under spotlight, fees, fund size, deals, track record, etc. Firms live in a hyper-scrutinized environment these days and it’s hard to believe the entire universe of PE LPs would be missing outright criminality.
Notice the straw man: we never claimed that the “entire universe” of private equity firms was engaged in “outright criminality”. You can have a hell of securities law and contract violations before you hit criminal conduct.
But we’ll put that aside and deal with the widespread myth: private equity is a world of big boys, and the limited partner investors are well-informed, well-advised consenting adults. If you believe this story, it follows that it would be unlikely that anyone could take advantage of them, and if so, it must have been due to some lapse on their end.
The problem is we’ve seen what happened in the mortgage backed securities world. In a realm of SEC registered prospectuses, which have much higher disclosure standards than the super-secret limited partnership agreements, we saw widespread abuses and an inability of investors to band together effectively or to get any meaningful restitution individually*. 
There are many reasons for investor passivity and ineffectiveness, but one was that the presumption of an ongoing relationship, which you would assume would operate in favor of the customers, meaning investors, actually worked in favor of the banks. Many important investors like mutual funds and pension funds didn’t want to rock the boat because they felt the needed to maintain good relationships with the Street to get access to product like this (erm, with product like this, less might be better, but no one seems to want to think that way). As we’ll discuss in later posts, we have similar motives at work here.
You see close analogies to the RMBS problem, of hopelessly meek investor representatives and advocates, in the private equity world. 
Investors in private equity funds (technically, limited partners or “LPs”) rely on their outside law firm as their first line of defense against PE firm misconduct. Outside counsel plays such a critical role because they – far more than the investors themselves – are the ones who review and analyze the fine print of the super-secret limited partnership agreements (“LPAs”) that are the contracts between PE firms and the investors.  These contracts are always drafted by the private equity firms, not by the investors. 
And remember,  these documents are the only vehicle for the investor to insure that the business is operated for his benefit and not that of the private equity fund sponsor. And the central lesson of the mortgage backed securities disaster was that investors incorrectly assumed that a party that had contractual duties actually fulfill those obligations. That did not happen in reality because the trusted intermediaries had strong economic incentives not to. 
Here are some examples of similar conflicts from the PE world: nothing prevents the private equity fund sponsors like Bain, KKR, and Blackstone from hiring affiliates (that is, paying fees to themselves at the expense of the investors) except the terms of the contracts. One would assume that typical agreements permit the hiring of affiliates as long as the fees are comparable to those paid in an arms-length transaction. But this language is meaningless if there is no independent party to assess that decision, no one to enforce the results of such a review, and no one to insure that any affiliated service-provider is competent and then executes its duties well. 
That problem could be solved in the agreement in several ways, such as having an independent party review everything of value that PE firm affiliates received from portfolio companies and require any proposed affiliate to be disqualified or face automatic clawbacks if fees were too high, or require similar independent audits of randonly-selcted transactions for fee and performance levels (again with automatic clawbacks and going-forwared prohibitions in the event of violations). But the cheapest and most effective way would be simply to bar the PE sponsor from getting paid for any services provided by anyone to a portfolio company, since the PE firm is already being paid a management fee and carried interest by the investors who ultimately own the portfolio companies.  However, this approach is effectively never used in the private equity industry. 
We’ve used the example of hiring affiliated companies. Similar issues apply to every major decision made by the fund sponsor, also referred to as the general partner, including buy-out offers, going public transactions, dividends and distributions, borrowing, and other related party transactions.
And these issues are real. Like all complex agreements, PE LPAs can be Trojan horses for clever drafting that make the investors think they are getting a particular deal, when they are really getting a different, inferior one.  The law firms that review the agreements for LP investors generally have entire practices dedicated to it, where the law firm generates economies of scale by reviewing the same LPA multiple times for numerous different clients participating in different closings, and where each client is paying the law firm tens of thousands of dollars.
On one level, it is a sweet deal to get paid tens of thousands of dollars to re-read the same document over and over and re-issue the same memo to LP investors.   However, those fees are chicken feed compared to the fees paid by private equity firms, either directly by having the PE firms as a client or indirectly by representing their portfolio companies.  For example, the formation of a new fund can easily generate a million dollars paid by the private equity general partnership. Likewise, a good-sized acquisition for a private equity fund can be a million dollar payday for the PE firm’s outside counsel.  Smaller but very steady legal fees are generated by law firms acting as counsel to companies that the private equity fund general partners like Bain and Blackstone have acquired for their various funds. These portfolio companies also buy and sell companies, engage in financings, and have routine corporate legal matters and the law firms have them as clients only by staying in the good graces of the private equity fund sponsor.  
This results in a major conflict of interest at big law firms: virtually all of them are making much more money from private equity firms, either directly or indirectly, than they are from the investors in private equity that they also represent. And the  investors have little in the way of good options, since those big law firms are the most expert in the PE space by virtue of all the work they do for the private equity firms themselves. 
The problem of inadequate review and oversight is further compounded by the fact that many investors operate in what amounts to a convoy system. They often can’t afford to pay for the full-blown deal and document review process (and cynically, why should they, given that they are not getting an individualized review?). Many simply copy the PE investment decisions of  investors recognized as being sophisticated and diligent, such as TIA CREFF, Calpers, Harvard, and Yale, and do only cursory reviews of their own.
Let’s look at a particularly egregious conflict involving the Boston law firm Ropes & Gray. Ropes is Boston’s ultimate Brahmin firm, with a pedigree dating back to 1865. Past partners including Henry Cabot Lodge and Archibald Cox.    
Industry insiders report that Ropes does the legal work for Harvard’s investments in private equity funds. Notably, Harvard’s endowment is one of the most important PE investors in the world. Harvard is not only in the top tier of private equity investors in terms of the total size of its commitments, but also has a very high percentage of its assets invested in private equity, making the strategy critical to the university’s financial well being. Moreover, the Harvard Management Company, Harvard’s investment arm, is widely considered to be  sophisticated and well run, and is widely viewed as a “thought leader” among PE investors.  
Ropes & Gray also represents two of Boston’s leading PE firms: Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners.  Ropes has long been the main outside counsel to Bain Capital, meaning it almost certainly drafted the some of the agreements it is reviewing for investors like Harvard, as well as working on numerous other matters for Bain at the management company level (for Bain Capital itself) and also representing Bain  funds as well, which are legally comprised of Bain’s investors and are theoretically legally distinct from Bain itself. Ropes’ name is on literally hundreds of SEC filing made by both Bain and TH Lee over a period of decades.
Harvard is an investor in multiple Bain and Thomas H. Lee funds. You can already see the potential for trouble. How can Ropes be a fair broker between such high profile players? And can it really be an aggressive negotiator for Harvard when on a dollars basis, Bain and Thomas H. Lee are much more lucrative clients? And in particular, how can you expect Ropes to tell Harvard about any clever tricks and traps it dreamed up and incorporated in the documents for Bain funds in which Harvard invested?
It’s hard to fathom how Harvard let this situation arise. From its earliest days, Ropes’ marquee client has been Harvard University. By contrast, the consulting firm Bain came into being in 1973, when the Ropes/Harvard relationship was already  more than 100 years old. Bain Capital was founded even later, in 1984. Harvard could easily have refused to let this situation arise or could have put limits on it. But even now,  despite the large fees  Harvard Management Company alone makes to Ropes ($10.8 million in 2012, making Ropes Harvard’s highest paid provider of any non-investment service), Bain and other private equity firms almost certainly pay more to Ropes than Harvard does in fees, which means one has to question how hard Ropes would push when their interests are in conflict.
But wait, it’s worse – much worse.  The March 6, 1998 Federal Register contained an application to the SEC by Ropes & Gray to form an in-house 1940 Act  “investment company” that would be owned by the employees of the firm in order to invest their capital.  Critically, as part of its investment company application, Ropes sought and was granted by the SEC an exemption from the normally comprehensive and ongoing public reporting requirements to the SEC that investment companies normally provide.
How has RGIP been investing the Ropes partners’ money? Thanks to the SEC waiver, it’s impossible to know everything. But RGIP appears regularly as an investor in Bain and Thomas H. Lee (another top Boston-based PE fund) deals.  
Pay attention, because the distinction I’m about to make is critical to understanding how stinky this is.  I am not talking about RGIP being an investor in Bain and Thomas H. Lee funds. To the extent that were the case, RGIP’s interests would be aligned with Harvard as a fellow fund investor, since they’d be in all the same deals, be subject to the same gains and losses, and presumably pay the same or similar fees.
Instead, Ropes & Gray, Harvard’s counsel, is investing alongside Bain and Thomas H. Lee funds in which Harvard is an investor.  From an economic perspective,   Ropes & Gray is investing ahead of Harvard, because it is not paying the fees a limited partnership investor pays. Moreover, it may well be in an even more advantaged position by virtue by getting access to only the best deals (as in cherrypicking within the funds**) and could potentially better rights on other fronts than its client.  
The proof from the Dunkin Brands prospectus:
The validity of the issuance of the shares of common stock to be sold in this offering will be passed upon for us by Ropes & Gray LLP, Boston, Massachusetts. Some attorneys of Ropes & Gray LLP are members in RGIP, LLC, which is a direct investor in Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and is also an investor in certain investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. RGIP, LLC directly and indirectly owns less than 1% of our common stock and is a selling stockholder in this offering. The validity of the common stock offered hereby will be passed upon on behalf of the underwriter by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, New York, New York.
The key language here is “direct investor” in the company. That means it holds shares, rather than holding a limited partnership interest in a private equity fund.
From the Sungard prospectus:
Some partners of Ropes & Gray LLP are members in RGIP LLC, which is an investor in certain investment funds affiliated with certain of the Sponsors [the PE firms, of which Bain Capital was one] and often a co-investor with such funds. RGIP LLC owns, directly and indirectly, shares of the capital stock of our Equity-Issuing Parent Companies representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of stock of each such company.
And here are more links to deal documents filed with the SEC showing RGIP as a co-investor with Bain:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1113668/000112329207000668/exhibite.htm
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1100820/000095014408006172/g14592exv3.htm
How do we know investing in the portfolio companies directly is a better deal than investing at a fund level? The limited partners themselves say so. From a March article in Pensions & Investments:
“Many large institutions are clamoring for co-investments because most co-investments are made on a no-fee, no-carried-interest basis, said David Fann, president and CEO of San Diego-based consulting firm TorreyCove Capital Partners LLC.” …
“The push is from limited partners that want to co-invest to drive down the cost of investing in private equity and to gain control over investments, Mr.[Delaney] Brown [of the UK activist investor Hermes GPE] said.
Let’s understand how the economics work.  RGIP owns shares directly in Bain/Thomas H. Lee fund portfolio companies.  When those companies pay a dividend, it’s a near certainty that 100% of the dividend amount from its shares flows directly into RGIP’s coffers.  The fund investors, by contrast, could get as little as none of  that same dividend, if that particular cash flow occurs during the “100% to GP catch-up” portion of the waterfall.  
Generally speaking, it’s well nigh impossible for a private equity firm to bring in a co-investor on a single deal and have that co-investor situated exactly parri passu with its fund investors in terms of economic and legal exposure.   A basic reason for that is that the cash flows that get paid out to fund LPs on a particular deal are calculated based on the prior cash flows of all the fund’s other deals. If the co-investor is in just one or a subset of all of the fund’s deals, it would be impossible to replicate that provision for them.  Further, there is no point to seek co-investor status unless one is getting a better deal than the fund. Otherwise, one might as well invest in the fund and avoid the administrative cost of managing the investments directly.  Thus the bottom line according to one PE insider I consulted  is:
RGIP’s deal must be different than the fund investors in some respect, which means that RGIP is not fully aligned with the interest of fund investors like Harvard and
It is extremely likely that RGIP’s deal is better than fund investors’ deal, as that is the generally recognized purpose of PE investors seeking co-investments rather than simply signing up to funds
As bad as all of this seems, we have either peculiar ineptness or an effort at obfuscation by Bain in some of its descriptions of RGIP and the role played by law firms generally.  Bain portfolio companies have repeatedly mischaracterized the relationship between RGIP and Bain in SEC filings over the years, claiming that RGIP is an arm of Bain even though it is clearly not.  For example, here is an SEC filing by Bain where, in a footnote, it refers to RGIP as an affiliate of one of its funds:
1. Includes 37,121 shares of stock owned by BCIP Associates II, 15,026 shares of stock owned by BCIP Associates II-C, 10,664 shares of stock owned by BCIP Trust Associates II, 8,964 shares of stock owned by BCIP Associates II-B and 2,669 shares of stock owned by BCIP Trust Associates II-B, 964 shares of stock owned by PEP Investments PTY Ltd., 16,843 shares of stock owned by Sankaty High Yield Asset Partners, L.P., and 3,717 shares of stock owned by RGIP, LLC, affiliates of Bain Capital Fund VI, L.P.
Now, in SEC-speak, the term “affiliate” has a very precise legal meaning, which is that an entity controls, is controlled by, or under common control with another entity.  There is no way that RGIP is an affiliate of a Bain fund.  The SEC would almost certainly view this mis-statement as an unintentional foot fault unworthy of sanction, but one does wonder whether in fact the false disclosure was done deliberately to mask the role of the lawyers co-investing in the deal.  
But if that statement is a foot fault, what about this? Having been dragged into the supervision of the SEC by Dodd Frank, Bain now maintains a public form ADV. In that form, Bain makes the following apparently misleading disclosure about the investment activities of its law firms:
Partners of the law firms engaged to  represent the Funds may be investors in the Funds, and may also represent one or more portfolio companies or limited partners of the Funds.
Note that Bain language conveniently omits what its and the Thomas H. Lee filings have repeatedly disclosed about RGIP, which is that the partners of law firms invest in the deals directly (as a “direct investor”), rather than in the funds. Of course, the finesse may be that PE fund partners do invest in Bain funds (as do some employees of investment banks) but RGIP is not a partner of a law firm, but an investment vehicle. So the disclosure is arguably narrowly accurate if substantively misleading. 
And in case you think the behavior we’e uncovered is infrequent, language from other Bain disclosures indicates otherwise. The Clear Channel prospectus, another Bain deal, discloses specifically that it isn’t just unnamed “partners of law firms” but that is it specifically Ropes that both invests in the funds and is “often” an investor in the portfolio companies:
The validity and enforceability of the exchanges notes and the related guarantees offered hereby will be passed upon for us by Ropes & Gray LLP, Boston, Massachusetts. Ropes & Gray LLP and some partners of Ropes & Gray LLP are members of RGIP, LLC, which is an investor in certain investment funds associated with the Sponsors and often a co-investor with such funds. RGIP, LLC owns, directly and indirectly, shares of capital stock of Holdings representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of stock of Holdings.

This ADV disclosure earlier also suggests yet another whopping conflict of interest on the part of Bain’s lawyers, which given all of the disclosures above, is almost certainly Ropes & Gray.  If you combine this ADV disclosure with all the other SEC disclosures from this post, it appears that Ropes & Gray represents not only Harvard (“…may also represent one or more limited parters”) as a single LP in Bain funds, but simultaneously, Ropes represents all of the partners collectively  (“…the law firms engaged to represent the Funds…”[the Fund is the entity comprised of the limited partners and the general partner]).  
So Ropes is professing to provide fair and objective advice when it appears to be on every side of these transactions imaginable, as counsel for Bain Capital, as counsel to the Bain funds, as counsel to some investors individually (Harvard), in certain cases, to the portfolio companies, and with at least some firm partners acting through a firm-sponsored investment vehicle as a direct investor in particular deals. 
I contacted Ropes & Gray, the Harvard Management, Bain Capital, and Thomas H. Lee for comment. Ropes & Gray, Harvard Management, and Bain did not respond, and Thomas H. Lee declined to comment.
Understand the issue here. I am not saying that Ropes & Gray is doing something technically impermissible. Lawyers are expected to get waivers when they are representing clients who have conflicts of interest, and presumably Ropes got one from Harvard. Similarly, the fact that Ropes represents both Bain as a fund sponsor and the fund itself as a separate legal entity would certainly be disclosed in Bain’s fund offering documents. One does wonder, however, why on earth Harvard would have ever granted Ropes a conflict waiver along these lines. 
On the other hand, the LPs would almost certainly not have been notified of Ropes’ conflict of interest in representing them corporately as fund counsel while also co-investing alongside them. The reason for this is that Bain itself, as the fund’s general partner, is the party that would waive the conflict between Ropes acting as fund counsel while co-investing alongside the fund.  As the GP, Bain is designated as the agent for the fund and its investors in this respect and can therefore sign-off on egregious conflicts of interest on the part of the fund counsel. Ropes appears to be exploiting what is effectively a loophole in the structure of private equity funds, where the GP is the legal agent for the LPs, in order to get sign-off on a massive conflict of interest with the LPs. 
So look at the money and power imbalances. On issues where the Bain’s and Thomas H. Lee’s interests are directly opposed to Harvard’s, how aggressive an advocate do you expect Ropes to be? The very fact that they are co-investors with the private equity kahunas is an awfully strong indicator of where they think their real interests lie. 
And this picture is broadly replicated, without the RGIP kicker, at every firm considered to be top drawer in this field. So even if Harvard were to become disaffected, it’s highly unlikely that it can get better representation elsewhere.
In the end, the question is for Spitzer, or whoever is the next New York City Comptroller: Who can you really trust to represent your interests in as outside counsel advising you on private equity investing, given the state of legal ethics even at white shoe law firms like Ropes & Gray?
____
*The parties that have had the best track records so far are not investors, but bond insurers, and that is by virtue of having better contractual rights, most important, access to loan files, than MBS investors. 
**This is very plausible in the case of Bain deals. As Bain’s lead outside firm, Ropes would have ongoing communications with the partners and one would expect would often be chosen as counsel to handle acquisitions for various Bain funds. Serving as deal counsel would make Ropes an active part of the due diligence process. That would give Ropes a considerable information advantage over the limited partner investors, and allow the law firm to pick and choose on the basis of privileged information.

I think if anyone would be responsive to concerns like this it would be Spitzer. Right now may not the best time (given he’s in hyper campaign mode), but once he’s elected I bet if you contact his people you’ll get some kind of response to wonkier type of issues like this. Heck, you may be able to get a sit-down interview with him.
PE is the most ungodly unity of lawyers and banksters. It comes as no surprise to me that you’ve discovered cases where they give “friendly” law firms direct investor preference rather than channelling them into into individual funds as LPs. And that actors like R&G are playing both sides in the deals set up.
I can’t imagine that Spitzer would ignore evidence of a rather clear conflict of interest like this. I think Sard was running his PR before but I don’t know who is the gatekeeper now.  But someone who may be closer to him should forward these “memos” and get him to at least acknowledge the issues








John July 30, 2013 at 8:51 am 

Has anyone tied suing the law firms involved for ethics violations?  If not, may Spitzer can be the first to do so?








MaroonBulldog July 30, 2013 at 12:56 pm 

The big law firms control the state bar regulators who write the “ethics” rules of professional responsibilty under which those big law firms might be sued.  And, if you’re proposing to sue one big law firm, you might need to hire another big law firm to do it, since big law firms may be able to swamp small law firms under piles of pleadings, motiions, and discovery requests.  And the big law firm you hire may have other practice groups doing the same kind of deals that you are propsoing to sue over.  All of which is to say that suing a big law firm might be throwing good money after bad.

The last honest man to work at Ropes & Gray was former Massachusetts Chief Judge and Harvard Law Professor Robert Braucher, who quit in 1940. Braucher was the only good thing about Harvard Law School when I was there in 1964-67. He died some time in the Seventies.
Everybody on the inside knows the assumed rectitude and professionalism of these law firms is a crock. They push paper and cash checks and probably don’t even dress like gentlemen any more.

Except if you are the NYC Comptroller overseeing more than a hundred billion dollars in public investments, who can offer a very lucrative deal to a law firm winning such a case and recovering a couple of billion dollars judgement or settlement – in addition to becoming the future law firm of choice for both the Comptroller and other investors who don’t want to be scammed.
Financial incentives cut both ways, a big investor can indeed rock the boat. Yves is right, it’s amazing how Harvard allowed this situation to arise.

1. Wealthy alumni endow chairs at Harvard University.
2. When the alum need legal advice, they use a law firm peppered with Harvard alumni.
3. Those lawyers eventually become judges
4. The old boys network goes on to protects its own in perpetuity








Mcmike July 30, 2013 at 9:47 am 

Participating on every imaginable side of a deal.  Just like the wall street banks.  Yet still allowed to enjoy perks and preferences that come with the status of alleged fudiciary and honest broker.
Truly emblematic of a thoroughly broken system.  Where conflict of interest has become the pervasive norm.








charger01 July 30, 2013 at 9:48 am 

Superb work. Thank you for sharing this.








Advocate July 30, 2013 at 10:41 am 

The nature of PE is all about loopholes and especially tax avoidance.  Don’t blame the playa, blame the game.  Applying the same thought process for public securities to PE is apples and dumptrucks.
The author is making assumptions based on appearances only, which on their face make some sense.  But do you really think big law firms lack internal controls around conflict of interest?  One would think that the author has never worked in a law firm.








JEHR July 30, 2013 at 11:00 am 

Yes, I do!








Fred July 30, 2013 at 11:29 am 

You have clearly articulated Ropes & Gray’s defense. “Conflicts are everywhere in a big law firm. What’s the big deal?”  The point here is that Ropes has taken the typical law firm’s conflicts in acting as an agent for multiple principal parties at different points in time and put those conflicts on steroids by making itself a principal party.  Further, why would Harvard ever reasonably grant a waiver for such a powerful conflict?  Harvard clearly had the power to deny one but didn’t because it shares the same attitude that you do, that gross conflicts are no big deal because, hey, everybody at Ropes went to Harvard Law School or Harvard College and therefore must be a paragon of virtue.








Anon July 31, 2013 at 2:46 am 

The point is that PE (and in particular leveraged loan driven buyouts) are a leading tax loophole.
Investors might not mind being scammed via inflated fees of 5-10%, if those fees are still less than the capital gains tax of 15%. (Especially if some of the excess “fees” are investments into off shore corporate entities suggested by the investor.)
Of course a public entity like NYC does not need to evade taxes and thus has different interests.












Gerard Pierce July 30, 2013 at 10:58 am 

Excellent Article. It illustrates some ideas that I have never clearly articulated, but which might be part of the path to cleaning up this broken system.
The comes a point where TPTB become so rapacious that they start trying to survive by eating each others liver.
The financial system can no longer make an adequate return by screwing the average man.
A large parts of the legal system has lost profitability as indicated by the associates that either didn’t get hired or who have been “unhired”. 
Transferring the work to India might be a short-term solution, but it still remains that there is a lot of high-powered legal talent out there looking for someone to sue.
As members of the 99%, our final solution is to demand bread and enjoy the circus.








Matthew Cunningham-Cook July 30, 2013 at 12:21 pm 

From the LP agreements with public pension funds that I’ve been able to get my hands on, this kind of language is common:
“109. A director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to b e entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to all other Directors of the Company.
110. For the purposes of Article 109, a disclosure to all other Directors to the effect that a director is a member, director or officer of another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction which may, after the date of the entry into the transaction or disclosure of the interest, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.
111. A director of the Company who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the Company may:
(a) vote on a matter relating to the transaction;
(b) attend a meeting of Directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be included among the Directors present at the meeting for the purposes of a quorum; and
(c) sign a document on behalf of the Company, or do any other thing in his capacity as a director, that relates to the transaction,
and, subject to compliance with the Act shall not, by reason of his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from such transaction and no such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.”
Makes these conflicts even easier to do.








Dikaios Logos July 30, 2013 at 12:35 pm 

Yves, really, really great stuff. While things like mortgage fraud have harmed poor people directly, the fact that Bain LPs like HMC are also vulnerable to finance B.S. is very important and should be made much more widely known. I hope this sort of thing can help us get more converts to the cause of reigning in this behavior.
One thing jumped out at me though:
“It’s hard to fathom how Harvard let this situation arise.”
I really disagree with this for a number of reasons.
First, the recent decades, and perhaps time before that, has featured a few insiders enjoying a sort of super-super tranche of cash flows from entities. Whether it is bank CEOs enlarging balance sheets to inflate their comp or professional services firms bilking HMC by playing with the alignment of interests, these entities are almost never functioning as the standard narrative assumes. Rather they become the cash cow for some psychopath (e.g. Willard Romney) who knows just a bit more than everyone else and can play a rigged game because of it.
Second, there is a culture embedded at Harvard and other ‘elite’ institutions that takes Lewis Lapham’s dictum of ‘assuming that by doing well, one is also doing good’ very, very seriously. In other words, for the merely upper-middle class Harvard grad to preserve his conceits about his superiority, he has to look to those from Harvard who have done even better in $ terms with great awe, not cynicism. I have seen this play out with investment committees and staff on a few occasions. Once, in the months before the Lehman collapse I told the investment staff of a large (10-11 figure $ assets), high-visibility nonprofit with large commitments to the poor that they their overly PE weighted portfolio (with all the biggest name funds) presented serious liquidity risks. They laughed out loud at me, especially the HBS grad in the room: those guys in big buyout firms HAD to know what they were doing! I also served on a smaller nonprofit’s investment committee and took serious grief from a couple of HBS buffoons and a top financial regulator for saying that our broker was a salesperson, not a fiduciary!
Third and finally, virtually everyone who knows enough to prevent this is easily co-opted. There is a revolving door between Bain, HMC, and Ropes. But most of those people are looking not to preserve Harvard, but to enrich themselves. I have heard Ropes attorneys speak of “ones that got away” basically fish stories about Bain deals that they felt they should have invested in when they had a chance. I have NEVER heard HMC staff or Ropes attorneys speak of protecting clients or fulfilling their fiduciary duties. Never.
In spite of my need for that digression, I know this is a killer post. I will read and re-read it, even though I was already moderately well versed in these details. And I REALLY hope everyone who cares about Harvard reads this, too.








Synopticist July 30, 2013 at 12:41 pm 

Very interesting article, thank you.
If Harvard get screwed over by their own lawyers, what chance do small institutions have?








Jess July 30, 2013 at 4:21 pm 

My Latin is a little rusty, but I think the phrase is “custodus effsus custodus”, translated as “Who shall watch the watchers?”
A friend of mine calls those eight schools in the northeast the “Poison Ivy League”.
Anybody ever watch that series “SUITS”, about the guy with the photographic memory who impersonates a Harvard Law grad to get a job with a firm that only hires Harvard alums? Would love to see a series like that where the firm sets out to screw its clients the public, everybody in every way that it can.








ScottS July 30, 2013 at 6:00 pm 

Many important investors like mutual funds and pension funds didn’t want to rock the boat because they felt the needed to maintain good relationships with the Street to get access to product like this (erm, with product like this, less might be better, but no one seems to want to think that way).
– This food is poisoned!
– And such small portions, too!








Lambert Strether July 30, 2013 at 10:46 pm 

What a bucket of snakes. “So look at the money and power imbalances.” Indeed.
We really need a replacement phrase for “top drawer.” Perhaps something drawn from The Inferno?








Kokuanani July 31, 2013 at 12:55 am 

Wonderful article, Yves.
I hope you’ve sent a copy to Matt Taibbi and of course to Eliot Spitzer.  Perhaps Elizabeth Warren and her staff might find this of interest as well?








Thisson July 31, 2013 at 2:01 pm 

Also note that while the 1940 act application purported to establish a firm owned by “employees,” the RGIP fund is owned by the partners of the firm (not the employees!)

Leptin Receptor is Involved in STAT3 Activation in Human Colorectal Carcinogenesis

            Uchiyama, Takashi; Takahashi, Hirokazu; Sugiyama, Michiko; Sakai, Eiji; Hosono, Kunihiro; Endo, Hiroki; Nakajima, Atsushi
        

            
The frequencies of -449 G allele in non GC group and GC group were 35.9% and 38.0%, respectively. Overall, there was no significant association between NFKB1 -449 C>G polymorphism and gastric carcinogenesis. On the other hand, the distribution of genotype in the subjects with diffuse type gastric cancer was 47GG, 61GC and 25GG (GG homozygote ratio; p=0.021 vs. non GC group). The NFKB1 GG homozygote had a significantly higher risk for the development of diffuse type gastric cancer by the logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, gender and HP infection status (OR, 1.99, 95%CI, 1.19-3.32; p= 0.0087). In the subjects younger than 60 years old, the adjusted risk for gastric cancer among individuals who were -449 GG homozygote was 2.09 (range, 1.09-4.01; p=0.026) compared with -449 C allele carriers. In the gastric cancer cases, invaded beyond mp layer and had lymph node metastasis, -449 GG homozygote was a significant risk factor (OR, 2.10; 95%CI, 1.28-3.44; p=0.0031, and OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.13-3.28; p=0.017, respectively). In addition, the inflammation score of HP positive -449 GG homozygote was significantly higher than that of HP positive A allele carriers (2.00±0.603 vs. 1.80±0.622, p=0.044). There were no significant association between the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy and NFKB1 -449 C>G polymorphism. [Conclusions] Our results suggest that a -449 GG homozygote of NFKB1 gene was associated with the severity of gastric mucosal inflammation under HP infection. Then, this genotype increases the risk for the subsequently developing diffuse type gastric cancer. Sa1955 Expression and Clinical Evaluation of Klk10 Gene in Colon Cancer Maroulio Talieri, Dimitrios Xinopoulos, Andreas Scorilas, Niki Arnogiannaki, Stefanos P. Bassioukas, Dimitrios Kypreos, Apostolos Poulakis, Dimitrios Dimitroulopoulos, Argyro Loukou, Emmanouil Paraskevas The human kallikrein gene family is a recently characterized group of 15 serine proteases tandemly located on chromosome 19q13.4. KLK10 is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but it is down regulated in breast and lung cancer. In this study, we examined the prognostic value of KLK10 gene expression in 140 colon cancer tissues for 50 of which paired normal colonic mucosa was available, from patients who underwent surgery for primary colon cancer at the Oncologic Hospital of Athens "Saint Savas". Agreement of the Institute's ethics committee was available. Total RNA was extracted from pulverized tissues, and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription. KLK10 was amplified by PCR using gene specific primers. The identity of the PCR product was verified by sequencing. Glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control gene. PCR products were separated on agarose gels and visualised by ethidium bromide. Following densitometric measurements of the band intensities using the Gel Logic 100 Imaging System, the ratio of KLK10/GAPDH band intensity was calculated. Based on this ratio, the KLK10 expression was characterised as low or high. KLK10 gene was expressed in 94/150 (62.6 %) colon cancer tissue, whereas all 50 normal colon mucosa examined were negative for KLK10. Also, from the18 adenomas examined 14 were positive for KLK10. RNA from DLD1 colon cancer cell line was used as positive control. KLK10 gene expression was found to be more frequent in patients with tumors of large size (p=0.02). The results were correlated with other clinicopathological variables and patient outcome. More advanced stage showed higher KLK10 expression (p<0.01). Follow-up analysis revealed that KLK10 was associated with overall survival (OS)(p=0.041) and Disease Free Survival (DFS)(p=0.02).Our results suggest that KLK10 is involved in colon cancer progression and that KLK10 gene may be characterised as a new marker of unfavourable prognosis for colon cancer. Sa1956 Genome-Wide Association Study Identified New Variants Associated With Colorectal Cancer Pawel Gaj, Ewa E. Hennig, Natalia Maryan, Krzysztof Przytulski, Teresa Starzynska, Alexander Teumer, Georg Homuth, Jaroslaw Regula, Jerzy Ostrowski Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Poland. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to a portion of polygenic cancer susceptibility, genetic variability between populations significantly affects the selection of SNPs that may associate with cancer risk. Aim: To selects SNP associated with sporadic CRC in the Polish population. Patients and methods: A literature review identified 24 SNPs associated with CRC risk. A confirmation study was designed, including 1269 healthy controls, 765 patients with adenoma, and 792 patients with sporadic CRC, all Polish Caucasians; genotyping was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems). In order to select new CRC-associated SNPs, a genome-wide association study (GWAS; 525 patients with adenomas, 630 patients with CRC, 705 healthy controls) was performed using equimolar pools of patient and control DNA applied to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. The frequency distribution of alleles was compared using both the 2 test and the t test statistics. In order to reduce the number of false positive associations caused by technical variation of the pools, only SNPs exhibiting significant p-values (p<0.001) of the t test and the 2 test, or those localized in linkage disequilibrium with significantly associated proxy-SNPs (physical distance of 100kb; r2>0.7) were selected. Marker filtration was performed using the PLINK software package. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results: While none of the literature-selected SNPs were observed to significantly associate with CRC or adenoma in Polish patients, the GWAS identified one SNP (rs6762970) overrepresented in adenoma patients and 4 (rs9283670, rs17165506, rs441261, rs715272) and 8 SNPs (rs2557227, rs12994941, rs7611300, rs7768988, rs9766794, rs40972, rs5978435, rs926064) overrepresented in female and male CRC patients, respectively. Conclusions: GWAS identified new variants associated with CRC and AD susceptibility in the Polish population.

Leptin, one of an adipocytokines, control appetite and exert its action through the leptin receptor (ObR), which includes binding motifs required for activation of the JAK/STAT signaling. ObR expression has been reportedly detected in human and rodent colonic tumors and as well as in human colon cancer cell lines. In the present study, we explored whether leptin stimulate the colorectal carcinogenesis. Methods: The relationship between serum leptin concentration and colorectal carcinogenesis were evaluated. Carcinoma (n=30), Adenoma (n=144) and colonoscopy-negative controls (n=64) were evaluated using total colonoscopy at Yokohama City University Hospital (Japan) from 2006 to 2009. Visceral fat accumulation was calculated with abdominal CT. Phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3), JAK2 and ObR expression were evaluated by western blot analysis and RT-PCR. Results: The serum leptin concentration had no statistical difference in colorectal carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for p-STAT3 and ObR observed in 40.6% and 66.7% of adenomatous glands, 80% and 95% of carcinoma. Otherwise, BclX, c-Myc, cyclin D1, cdc2, cyclin B1 and VEGF were significantly expressed in adenoma or carcinoma. Conclusion: Is was suggested that ObR and STAT3 expression were more important than serum leptin level. These results mean ObR expressed in early carcinogenesis enables tumor growth through leptin signaling. Leptin signaling might be suggested novel preventive approaches for colorectal carcinogenesis. Sa1958 High Frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutations in a Series of Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Other Preneoplastic Lesions Suggests an Association With BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations Aimee L. Lucas, Elana B. Mitchel, Caroline Hwang, Sheila Kumar, Liyong Deng, Reena Shakya, Thomas Ludwig, John A. Chabot, Wendy Chung, Harold Frucht BACKGROUND: Approximately 15% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are hereditary. Mutations in BRCA2, and to a lesser extent BRCA1, have been suggested to confer an increased risk of PDAC. Within the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, three common founder mutations BRCA1 185delT, BRCA1 5382insC, and BRCA2 6174delT are found with a combined frequency of 2-3%. Our pancreas center manages a population which is 20% AJ, providing a means of efficiently screening this population for BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations. We hypothesized that our population would have an increased carrier frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing surgical resection for adenocarcinoma or preneoplastic lesions of the pancreas at a single institution between 2004 and 2010. All specimens were reviewed by an experienced pathologist. Genomic DNA was isolated from de-identified normal tissue adjacent to the pathologic tissue, and analyzed for the three founder AJ mutations. Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: Tissue was available for 248 patients, who were 48.4% male, 19.8% AJ, 41.5% non-AJ, and 38.7% unknown or other religion. 11 of 248 (4.4%) were found to be BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. Four patients were carriers for BRCA1 185delAG; one with PDAC, one with duodenal adenocarcinoma, one with endocrine neoplasm and one with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), while 1 patient with PDAC carried a mutation in BRCA1 5382insC. Six patients were carriers for BRCA2 6174delT; four with PDAC, one with endocrine neoplasm, and one with IPMN. Given that only 19.8% of the population was AJ, the total carrier frequency for AJ patients is 22.4%, which differs from the overall AJ population (p-value<.001). Individual carrier frequencies of BRCA1 185delAG (8.1%), BRCA1 5382insC (2.0%) and BRCA2 6174delT (12.2%) also differ from the general AJ population (p-values<.001). The maximum percentage AJ in our cohort is 58.5%, which would produce an estimated total BRCA1/BRCA2 carrier frequency of 7.4% (p-value<.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increased frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 AJ founder mutation carriers is seen within our patient cohort. While the high frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations detected may result from a higher than expected number of AJ patients in our patient population, it is likely that 19.8% AJ is accurate based upon our previous studies. These data do not necessarily suggest a causative role for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in PDAC, although they may suggest other important genes cosegregate with the BRCA1/BRCA2 alleles. Further studies are underway to clarify the role of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Sa1959 Pancreatic Cancer in Minority Patients: The Experience at One Academic Center From 2002-2010 Adriana Campos Serrano, Lauren G. Khanna, Sunil Amin, Aimee L. Lucas, Harold Frucht BACKGROUND: Pancreatic carcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, with near universal fatality. Despite the growing number of racial minorities in the United States, there is limited information regarding pancreatic cancer in this population. Our aim was to determine the extent and experience with minority patients at our tertiary academic institution. METHODS: An observational retrospective study using our tertiary referral and inner city hospital's clinical database, and the SEER database. Patients were self-identified as Black/ Non-Hispanic, Black-Hispanic or White-Hispanic from 2002 to 2010. RESULTS: Over the past 8 years, 22.1% of patients with pancreatic cancer (668 of 3021) at our institution belonged to minority groups. Of patients with pancreatic cancer seen at our institution, the percentage of minority patients increased steadily from 18.1% in 2002 to a peak of 30.2% in 2006, then decreased to 26.4% in 2007, 21.0% in 2008, 12.9% in 2009 and 13.6% thus far in 2010. This declining trend is statistically significant for all three minority groups and for each individual group (Black/Non-Hispanic p=0.0003, Black-Hispanic p=0.0129 and White-Hispanic p=0.0029 by the Cochran-Armitage Trend Test). In contrast, as determined by the SEER database, the percentage of all minority patients (19.7%), and of each of these S-355 AGA Abstracts AGA Abstracts

The frequencies of -449 G allele in non GC group and GC group were 35.9% and 38.0%,respectively. Overall, there was no significant association between NFKB1 -449 C>G poly-morphism and gastric carcinogenesis. On the other hand, the distribution of genotype inthe subjects with diffuse type gastric cancer was 47GG, 61GC and 25GG (GG homozygoteratio; p=0.021 vs. non GC group). The NFKB1 GG homozygote had a significantly higherrisk for the development of diffuse type gastric cancer by the logistic regression analysisafter adjustment for age, gender and HP infection status (OR, 1.99, 95%CI, 1.19-3.32; p=0.0087). In the subjects younger than 60 years old, the adjusted risk for gastric canceramong individuals who were -449 GG homozygote was 2.09 (range, 1.09-4.01; p=0.026)compared with -449 C allele carriers. In the gastric cancer cases, invaded beyond mp layerand had lymph node metastasis, -449 GG homozygote was a significant risk factor (OR,2.10; 95%CI, 1.28-3.44; p=0.0031, and OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.13-3.28; p=0.017, respectively).In addition, the inflammation score of HP positive -449 GG homozygote was significantlyhigher than that of HP positive A allele carriers (2.00±0.603 vs. 1.80±0.622, p=0.044).There were no significant association between the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy andNFKB1 -449 C>G polymorphism. [Conclusions] Our results suggest that a -449 GG homozy-gote of NFKB1 gene was associated with the severity of gastric mucosal inflammation underHP infection. Then, this genotype increases the risk for the subsequently developing diffusetype gastric cancer.Sa1955Expression and Clinical Evaluation of Klk10 Gene in Colon CancerMaroulio Talieri, Dimitrios Xinopoulos, Andreas Scorilas, Niki Arnogiannaki, Stefanos P.Bassioukas, Dimitrios Kypreos, Apostolos Poulakis, Dimitrios Dimitroulopoulos, ArgyroLoukou, Emmanouil ParaskevasThe human kallikrein gene family is a recently characterized group of 15 serine proteasestandemly located on chromosome 19q13.4. KLK10 is expressed in normal mammary epithe-lial cells but it is down regulated in breast and lung cancer. In this study, we examined theprognostic value of KLK10 gene expression in 140 colon cancer tissues for 50 of whichpaired normal colonic mucosa was available, from patients who underwent surgery forprimary colon cancer at the Oncologic Hospital of Athens “Saint Savas”. Agreement of theInstitute's ethics committee was available. Total RNA was extracted from pulverized tissues,and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription. KLK10 was amplified by PCR using genespecific primers. The identity of the PCR product was verified by sequencing. Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control gene. PCR products were separatedon agarose gels and visualised by ethidium bromide. Following densitometric measurementsof the band intensities using the Gel Logic 100 Imaging System, the ratio of KLK10/GAPDHband intensity was calculated. Based on this ratio, the KLK10 expression was characterisedas low or high. KLK10 gene was expressed in 94/150 (62.6 %) colon cancer tissue, whereasall 50 normal colon mucosa examined were negative for KLK10. Also, from the18 adenomasexamined 14 were positive for KLK10. RNA from DLD1 colon cancer cell line was used aspositive control. KLK10 gene expression was found to be more frequent in patients withtumors of large size (p=0.02). The results were correlated with other clinicopathologicalvariables and patient outcome. More advanced stage showed higher KLK10 expression(p<0.01). Follow-up analysis revealed that KLK10 was associated with overall survival(OS)(p=0.041) and Disease Free Survival (DFS)(p=0.02).Our results suggest that KLK10 isinvolved in colon cancer progression and that KLK10 gene may be characterised as a newmarker of unfavourable prognosis for colon cancer.Sa1956Genome-Wide Association Study Identified New Variants Associated WithColorectal CancerPawel Gaj, Ewa E. Hennig, Natalia Maryan, Krzysztof Przytulski, Teresa Starzynska,Alexander Teumer, Georg Homuth, Jaroslaw Regula, Jerzy OstrowskiBackground: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Poland.While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to a portion of polygenic cancersusceptibility, genetic variability between populations significantly affects the selection ofSNPs that may associate with cancer risk. Aim: To selects SNP associated with sporadicCRC in the Polish population. Patients and methods: A literature review identified 24 SNPsassociated with CRC risk. A confirmation study was designed, including 1269 healthycontrols, 765 patients with adenoma, and 792 patients with sporadic CRC, all Polish Caucasi-ans; genotyping was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems).In order to select new CRC-associated SNPs, a genome-wide association study (GWAS; 525patients with adenomas, 630 patients with CRC, 705 healthy controls) was performed usingequimolar pools of patient and control DNA applied to Affymetrix Genome-Wide HumanSNP 6.0 arrays. The frequency distribution of alleles was compared using both the χ2 testand the t test statistics. In order to reduce the number of false positive associations causedby technical variation of the pools, only SNPs exhibiting significant p-values (p<0.001) ofthe t test and the χ2 test, or those localized in linkage disequilibrium with significantlyassociated proxy-SNPs (physical distance of 100kb; r2>0.7) were selected. Marker filtrationwas performed using the PLINK software package. The study was approved by the localethics committee. Results: While none of the literature-selected SNPs were observed tosignificantly associate with CRC or adenoma in Polish patients, the GWAS identified oneSNP (rs6762970) overrepresented in adenoma patients and 4 (rs9283670, rs17165506,rs441261, rs715272) and 8 SNPs (rs2557227, rs12994941, rs7611300, rs7768988,rs9766794, rs40972, rs5978435, rs926064) overrepresented in female and male CRCpatients, respectively.

Canon BG-E14 overview




1Description







The Canon BG-E14 Battery Grip is compatible with the Canon EOS 70D and 80D DSLR Cameras and provides improved handling, versatile control, and extended battery life when in use. It accepts up to two LP-E6 lithium-ion battery packs to effectively double the camera's battery life. Six AA batteries can also be used as well as the optional ACK-E6 AC Adapter Kit for continuous power.

The design of the grip improves shooting in the vertical orientation and provides an overall more ergonomic structure for holding the 70D. A second shutter release button, main dial, multi-controller, AF point selection button, AE/FE lock button, AF start button, and multi-function button are all integrated into the grip for improved and versatile handling.
