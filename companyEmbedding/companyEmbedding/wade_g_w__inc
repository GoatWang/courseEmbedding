About Us




Submitted by admin on Thu, 07/26/2012 - 13:17


About UsA Different Kind of Wealth Management Firm
Some wealth management firms claim to provide comprehensive services, but our team actually delivers. At GW & Wade, we tell clients to call us for anything—and we mean it. New car purchase, insurance questions, 529 options for college planning: it’s all part of our holistic approach to wealth management.
We’re also unlike other wealth management firms in that we operate independently to provide objective investment advice and sophisticated financial planning strategies. Where banks and brokerages try to sell you on commissionable products and services, we’re held to a higher standard (the fiduciary standard); our recommendations are based solely on your best interests.
Most importantly, we’ve built our business on the promise of trust. Most new clients come to us by way of referral, following the strong recommendation of a current client who has experienced our dedication and integrity first hand.  With offices in Wellesley, MA and Palo Alto, CA, we’re growing that network of trust every day. We hope you’ll want to be a part of it.

What are analysts saying about Illinois Tool Works stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Illinois Tool Works stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the last three months, Illinois Tool's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial market. Over the long run, the company’s organic and inorganic growth tactics, its long-term Enterprise Strategy and sound capital allocation schemes will prove beneficial. For 2017, it increased its earnings guidance to $6.20-$6.40 per share. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4%, an improvement over the prior forecast of 1.5-3.5%. Total revenue is anticipated to come within $13.9-$14.1 billion range. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock increased for 2018. " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ITW hosted an Investor Day in New York this morning and provided initial guidance for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% and 100bps of EBIT expansion from Enterprise Initiatives are projected to yield EPS in the range of $6.00-$6.20 (Consensus at $6.14 on revenue growth of 3%). With a strong history of execution and low drama, we continue to view ITW as a core holding. Bottom Line: 2017 another year of stable growth. ITW’s preliminary forecast for organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% for 2017 compares to current consensus forecast of ~3% but assumes no improvement in end market trends. The guidance includes roughly 50bps of headwind from Product Line Simplification (PLS) actions, lower than the 100bps headwind since 2014-16. ITW’s targeted EPS range of $6.00-$6.20 compares to current consensus of $6.14. Of note: ITW’s 2017 EBIT margin target is 23.5%, 100bps above the 2016 target, and indeed management noted the target could be conservative." (12/5/2016)
