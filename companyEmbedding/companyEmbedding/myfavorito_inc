Worth the Weight
My favorite product is my scale. I know many women are gasping as they read this, but hear me out. Although the scale reminds me of exactly how much I have gained or how much I need to continue to work out, it also reminds me how much my husband loves me―because whatever it says, that will always be just a number to him.
Melissa Biggers
San Antonio, TX
Squeaky Clean
Club soda gets fresh stains out of carpets better than any cleanser I’ve tried. I also drop my diamond engagement ring in a cupful to get it super sparkly before special events.
Caurie Putnam
Brockport, New York
I am allergic to most of the cleaning products on the market, so when I find something that doesn't make me sneeze, I'm thrilled. I use Method Biodegradable Cleaning Wipes to clean everything from the kitchen table to spots on the floor. Plus, they're good for my environmental conscience.
Elvira Berezowsky
Edmonton, Alberta
I have used so many products to clean my bathtub, but nothing works as well as Dow Scrubbing Bubbles. I've tried other products, but I had to go back. I can just spray over the whole tub, the walls, everywhere. I come back in five minutes and, with little to no work, my tub is clean, with no residue.
Christina Taft
Beaverton, OregonSimple Green all-purpose cleaner does such a great job cleaning so many things around the house besides the usual floors, walls, and countertops. Just a little sprayed on a damp cloth gets sneakers white again, the outdoor patio set looking like new, and car interiors clean. My husband puts it in his power washer and cleans the house siding with it. In addition, it's fresh smelling, nontoxic, and biodegradable. And because it is concentrated and goes a long way, it's economical.
Dorrie Leaderstorf
Wheatfield, New York
I'm convinced this beautiful little sponge really is magic, and it's so versatile. In one use, the 3M Magic Eraser "erased" five―count them, five―years of bachelor scum off the walls and every surface in my boyfriend's kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. I actually feel sad when the sponge is no longer usable. An amazing product.
Arika Ruse
Minneapolis, Minnesota
It doesn't matter what I need to clean―and with two teenagers that's a lot. I use Windex in our bathrooms, our kitchen, our bedrooms, on the cars, on the patio, and on the porch. I keep the largest refill bottle I can find in our "housekeeping bucket" with the other cleaning products, but I always run out of Windex first.
Antoinette Parker
Menifee, California
I used to think Endust was just for dusting, but it cleans my stainless-steel appliances like nothing I've ever found. And trust me―I've tried a ton of products.
Amy Houston
Fort Wayne, Indiana
Everyone who has pets should keep a bottle of Nature's Miracle Orange-Oxy stain and odor remover handy. I have two cats and a dog, and this product is truly a miracle. One of my cats, angry that I had brought a dog into the house, urinated on my bed. I used this product on the stain. The next day, the mattress was not only pristine white but also smelled wonderful―not even a hint of odor left. And this product has never discolored my furniture or carpeting.
Lishia Rolbiecki
Burnsville, Minnesota
Any brand of foaming soap makes it fun and easy for my kids to wash their hands, and I don’t have to worry about gloppy liquid soap drizzled all over the sink or dripped onto their clothes.
Krista Noel
Carlisle, Pennsylvania
I’m so happy that being green is finally catching on. In the bathroom, I use Method Eucalyptus Mint flushable wipes. They’re great for cleaning everything from the floor to the sink. Not only do they make the room smell good for hours, but you can also toss them in the toilet when you’re done―because they’re biodegradable.
Jennifer Allen
Roswell, Georgia
My favorite product is the Natchez Solution. It can be used to polish all types of wood. My daughter-in-law introduced me to it, and when I got my own, I went crazy, using it on my kitchen cabinets, dining table and chairs, all my wood furniture, and doors and baseboards. It covers up and conceals scratches or any flaws in the wood. It’s like a miracle.
Ellen Gervase
Itasca, IllinoisShaklee Basic H2 Organic Super Cleaning Concentrate not only cleans greasy stoves, crusted spills, hair-dye drips, and wall scuffs but it’s also pet-and child-safe. If you can have only one cleaning product for your car, family, and home, Basic H2 should be it.
Gesci Meyer
Mountain Home, Idaho
 
Out of the Closet
I love my black sheath dress by French Connection because it makes me feel like Audrey Hepburn―classic and gorgeous.
Christine E. Hong
New York, New York
The idea of finding love on the Internet seemed ludicrous to me. Isn’t the thrill of seeing and touching in real life much better than surfing and clicking on the screen? Then I spied my Chloe Paddington bag on eLuxury.com, and it was the perfect fit. The bright yellow hue fed my bold-color fetish, and the roomy compartments chicly concealed my daily purse staples. Who would have known that a night on the Internet could yield a lifetime of love?
Zandile Blay
Jersey City, New Jersey
My Massachusetts-made Conversation Shoes are dressy enough to wear to work, cute enough to pair with a casual skirt, and comfortable enough to walk miles in without a single ache or pain. Best of all? They’re actually stylish, which is heavenly for someone who had grown to believe that style and comfort were mutually exclusive when it came to shoes.
Susan Happel Edwards
Westborough, Massachusetts
Food, Glorious Food
See’s Candies Dark Chocolate Buttercreams have no substitute. I ask for them as Christmas presents and whenever my family visits me in Canada. There are several products I miss from the States, but See’s tops the list.
Linda Topf
Vernon, British Columbia
Puff-pastry dough is so versatile, it can be used for any meal. I keep a box in the freezer in case of unexpected company. You can roll the dough for quiches, empanadas, pinwheels, piroshkis, and potato puffs. Or press the dough into cupcake tins, bake, and fill with pudding or cheesecake for dessert. I can have a dish ready in half an hour.
Mona McCormack
Anaheim Hills, California
Kitchen Aids
My favorite product is my Cuisinart mixer. Ever since my husband gave it to me, I have been able to make the most delicious foods and save us money. Anything from cookies for my nieces and nephew to great ravioli for dinners with my family and friends. It really is a great product.
Nydia Bonilla
Fort Lee, New Jersey
The Lansky knife-sharpening system is the easiest, most effective system I have ever used. Since the product ensures that the knife blade is honed at precisely the correct angle, the results are always consistent.
Paul Feldman
Toronto, Ontario
The Vacuvin pineapple corer is the ultimate tool. It slices and cores a pineapple in a minute or less and doesn't require a lot of strength to do so. I bought mine about four or five years ago and have given many of them as gifts to friends and family.
Mary Mekelburg
Greeley, Colorado
I use Diamond of California walnuts in my yogurt and salads just about every day. Their omega-3 fatty acids are good for the body, and the taste is good for the soul.
Jennifer Russon
Deerfield Beach, Florida
My favorite kitchen product is the new SideSwipe Spatula Mixer Blade attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer. It allows me to incorporate all the ingredients for batters without having to stop the machine and scrape down the bowl. I especially love it for creaming butter, making frosting and ganache, and mixing batters with sticky ingredients, like peanut butter and cream cheese.
Felicia Busick
Westerville, Ohio
We’re a family of five, with three boys involved in sports. It’s hectic trying to get everyone to and from practice and still put dinner on the table. So my favorite products are my Crock-Pot and rice cooker. When I know I’m going to have a busy afternoon, I can put my main entrÃ©e in the Crock-Pot and make a side dish of rice in the cooker. Even if it’s crazy in the evening, I know that all I have to do is serve.
Amy Unsworth
Manhattan, Kansas
My Presto Cool Touch Tilt ’N’ Drain Griddle is the best. A regular griddle pan just isn’t large enough to make pancakes, eggs, bacon, grilled cheese, and more for a family of four. I use my Cool Touch almost daily.
Jennifer Spira
West Greenwich, Rhode Island
Beautiful Laundrette
Dryer sheets! They keep your clothes smelling fresh, they make great dusters, and I stick a couple in the linen closets to make the sheets smell nice. I also stick them in the vacuum cleaner so the air smells nice while I'm vacuuming.
Lisa SanDonato
Weymouth, Massachusetts
My favorite product is Biz liquid stain zapper, because even when I get salad dressing on my favorite red sweater and have washed it several times, soaking it with this overnight will get the spot out and save the sweater.
Teresa Bolt
Gledora, California
I keep Tide-to-Go pens in my purse, my glove box, my book bag, and my desk. Once I got a stain on a new white dress in church, and the pen took it right out. By the time the service was over, my dress was as good as new.
Beth Portice
Cedarville, Ohio
I loathe laundry, but I love my laundry helper, the Flip Fold. It’s a flat form that helps you fold T-shirts, pants, and towels perfectly. Because the end result is having all the clothes folded the same way, I feel a small sense of accomplishment, and this helps me want to do the laundry.
Melody McCabe
Waukesha, WisconsinDowny Wrinkle Releaser is amazing. Spray it on and clothes become wrinkle-free. I haven’t used an iron in months. I recommend it to all my friends and have even been known to do demonstrations!
Andi Riley
Beaufort, South Carolina
I love Wine Away, a red-wine stain remover. It has saved linens, rugs, sweaters, and shirts, not to mention preventing numerous arguments. Just spray it on a red-wine spill and the stain is totally removed.
Margie Chenery
Raleigh, North Carolina

 De-Lovely

No, I haven't just had an expensive facial, nor have I just come back from a relaxing week aboard my yacht. My skin has that succulent and shimmering glow because I have my magic skin-freshening product, Prescriptives vibrant cream. It gives my 55-year-old face a helping hand, and sometimes coworkers comment that my face is glowing.
Marsha Weitzman
Plainview, New YorkKiehl's Epidermal Re-Texturing Micro-Dermabrasion. I use it twice a week, and it leaves my skin smooth and dramatically improves the texture. I'm hooked.
Kristen Martin
Richmond, Virginia
My main product addiction is Elderflower Eye Gel from the Body Shop. I've been using it ever since I discovered it in college, at least 15 years ago. It depuffs my morning eyes and feels fabulous. And I'm thinking it may have something to do with the fact that, at the age of 36, I have no lines around my eyes and still occasionally get carded. I pray this product never gets discontinued.
Stacy Varner
Woodland Hills, California
Good old Vaseline works with an eyelash curler to make wow lashes, is an instant lip glosser, and provides rough-callous relief when applied to the soles of the feet. It even adds a quick shine to dressy shoes.
Diane Iannaccone
North Babylon, New York
Due to my frugal nature, I waited years before purchasing an electric toothbrush―it just seemed too expensive. What a mistake! My Sonicare is the best product I have ever purchased.
Susan Schaefer
Cumming, GeorgiaAquaphor. I use it on my lips, cuticles, elbows, heels, and minor cuts. It leaves everything soft and moisturized without an overwhelming scent. I could not go a day without it.
Emily Green
Atlanta, GeorgiaSmith's Rosebud Salve Original Formula has been my best defense against chapped lips in the beating 40-mile-per-hour winds of a Chicago winter and the equally harsh Daytona Beach sunshine. It also works against diaper rash and is a blemish fighter. And when empty, the container can hold little things you would lose otherwise.
Jessica Paugh
Lakeland, Florida
At first I thought a razor with an attached shaving bar was lame and gimmicky, but with the Schick Intuition Razor, I don't have to hang my lathered leg out of my tiny shower to keep the shaving cream on. And I shave more often, which my boyfriend doesn't mind a bit.
Laura Harvey
Vista, California
My favorite product is Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo & Conditioner. It wakes me up in the morning with a gentle tingle, and it has no sulfates, so you are reducing your daily toxins.
Melanie Linter
Portland, Oregon
The balls and the heels of my feet used to be so cracked and dry―especially in the summer, when I wore sandals and flip-flops. Then I purchased Podiatrist's Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream at Sally's Beauty Supply. With the occasional help of a foot file after a shower and an application of this cream before bed (you don't have to wear socks), my feet have never looked better. The cream is also inexpensive, and it goes a long way.
Beatrice Hall
San Antonio, Texas
I love my Conair hot rollers. When I use them, my hair looks fabulous and I feel sexy. And from the look on my boyfriend's face when he sees me, he thinks so, too.
Lisa Brzezinski
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
My favorite product is Neutrogena Ultrasheer Sunscreen SPF 30. My husband and I work as captain and first mate on a catamaran for a charter business on St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I used to struggle with putting on sunscreen faithfully, and my skin would break out from oily waterproof lotions. This sunscreen protects from UVA and UVB rays and is hypoallergenic, waterproof, and not greasy. Now I get all the sun protection I need with no breakouts.
Lindsay Kammerzelt
Christiansted, Virgin Islands
My favorite beauty product is Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. I have used it since my freshman year of college (I'm now 47). It makes my skin feel wonderfully smooth and hydrated, and people tell me I have very young-looking skin. My favorite cleaning product is the Swiffer duster. It makes short work of dusting and can be used on so many surfaces.
Martha Judiscak
Knoxville, Tennessee
By far, baby lotion! My mom and I love it. It's absolutely all-purpose and makes life so much simpler. I use it to moisturize my legs after a shave, my hands during the daytime, and all my parts before bed. When traveling, I even use it as a facial moisturizer, to make packing simpler. It's clean, pure, and efficient―my favorite.
Cathy Hill
Beaverton, Oregon
I love the Bare Essentials mineral makeup line. It works to give me that natural look, and it never irritates my sensitive skin. I haven't gone back to traditional makeup products since.
Lina Kim
Honolulu, Hawaii
Burt’s Bees Decollete Cream is intended to keep your dÃ©colletage soft and smooth, but it works wonders for the bikini line after a shave, keeping razor bumps away.
Amber Sheppard
Omaha, NebraskaAussie Sprunch Spray for curly hair. I had it on my wedding registry. I was given 16 bottles.
Nicole Miller
Wilmington, North Carolina
About eight years ago, I discovered this product in the baking-goods aisle, and it has been a favorite of mine ever since. Buttermilk Blend, powdered cultured buttermilk, from Saco Foods helps me make sure that I don't have to waste tons of buttermilk when I need only half a cup for a recipe. Simply add the powdered buttermilk to the dry ingredients, then add the water when you blend the wet and dry ingredients together. Recipes come out perfectly every time, with that great taste of buttermilk.
Kimberly Berry
Saratoga Springs, New York
After my baby was diagnosed with a milk allergy, I learned how to cook everything with olive oil instead of butter. I also use olive oil as a moisturizer―it makes my hands as soft as my baby's.
Leslie Burket
St. Petersburg, Florida
White vinegar comes in biodegradable glass containers, and along with a drop of lavender oil and newspaper, it works wonders cleaning my windows. A splash of vinegar freshens a load of towels in the laundry and deodorizes just about anything. Once in a while, I use it as a rinse in the shower to give my hair extra shine and bounce. At the same time, I feel good about the products I'm not using, which could potentially harm the environment.
Amy Weed
Marblehead, Massachusetts
My go-to product is Pam cooking spray. It makes kitchen cleanup a breeze, and it will also set a manicure or silence squeaky doors and windows without the nasty smell of WD-40.
Lorelei Slemker
Clayton, Ohio
Bite-size Shredded Wheat cereal is the best. It provides a quick, healthy breakfast or snack, and its mellow flavor blends nicely with other breakfast cereals, so I can boost my fiber while indulging in a sweeter treat occasionally. On cold days, adding warm milk to a bowl of shredded wheat warms me up and keeps my motor running for hours.
Miriam Kroschelo
North Bend, Washington
I love Lipton's Quietly Chamomile herbal tea, because no matter what kind of day I have had, it always makes me feel better and sleep well.
LeReese Parker
Washington, D.C. 
Drink To That
My husband and I have always enjoyed coffee, but he used to make too much and it would wind up going to waste. I was glad when I found the Kuerig one-cup coffeemaker. The coffee is premeasured in small plastic cups, so there are never any grounds to clean up. Plus, it takes only about 30 seconds to make a single cup, so now we have fresh, hot coffee several times a day, whenever we want.
Desire Buckner
Owings Mills, Maryland Kraft Foods Fruit2O flavored water is the best product to come along in a while. It's a healthy and tasty alternative to soft drinks and caffeinated beverages, and the fruit flavoring keeps me from getting bored with drinking water. I'm finally consuming the amount of water health-care professionals recommend for a healthy body. No sugar, no calories, no fat, no carbs! My skin is glowing, and I feel great.
Jennifer Castro
Plano, Texas
Bright Ideas
After hearing about the impact that using just one eco-bulb can have on the environment, I replaced all the incandescent bulbs in my house with CFL bulbs. That one change motivated me to find other ways to go green. Along with recycling, I no longer use paper napkins or towels, I have replaced chemical cleaning products with vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice, and I have reduced our water usage. I continue to look for more ecologically responsible tips and credit this newfound commitment to the eco-bulb.
Rochelle Oberholser
Charlotte, North Carolina
I love my little red Toyota Prius. I am so proud to drive a hybrid and to do my part to help the environment. My friends love it, too, because I'm always offering to drive. I know my gas mileage is better than their SUVs', and with a license plate like kik gas, I know everybody else knows it.

If you’ve read a good amount of my blog posts and my profile, you probably feel like you know me pretty well. However, I have yet to reveal the most important fact about myself of all– what my favorite Digilent product is.
Well, my favorite released product is the ZYBO. In fact, to commemorate this blog post I took this picture; with the ZYBOt, ZYBO, and my ZYBO shirt.
The ZYBOt, ZYBO, and me in my ZYBO shirt.
The ZYBO features the Zynq-7010 SoC, which integrates a Xilinx 7-series FPGA, and a dual-core ARM cortex-A9 processor. This allows powerful embedded Linux driven applications. You can start with embedded Linux and move to a robotics application like the ZYBOt.
The Zybo even has a textbook for you to learn how to use it, and use for reference called The Zynq Book. It’s a powerful board, with awesome learning materials to back it up.
To learn more about the ZYBO, visit the product page or the resource center.

About Author



Kaitlyn Franz


When I started school I wasn’t interested in any of things I’m passionate about now. In fact originally I started out wanting to study art. But then I decided I didn’t want to have people telling me what to create, so I changed to music. Then I decided I didn’t want to ruin a hobby by making it my career. At the same time my Physics class was teaching a unit on the physics of music, and I thought that was way interesting, so I changed to physics. Then by the time physics was over I decided that the coolest part of physics was electricity and magnetism, and I may as well get a degree that transfers directly into a career. So while all this was happening, I was attending Shoreline Community College, and during that time I found my passion, or rather presented itself repeatedly, until I realized, maybe I should take a hint from the universe. While at community college, I was asked to help at the high school by tutoring chemistry students. Then I was asked to help at the elementary school by being a math Olympiad coach. I continued both because I found I really enjoyed it. I also had an opportunity, and was hired to be a tutor in the Math Learning Center at the Community College, a job I really loved. At the same time I was working as a Nanny, which I had been doing for several years, the main reason because I could and would answer the hard questions the kids asked honestly (i.e. why is the sky blue). I then was recommended by the patrons of the MLC to the transfer tutoring center (private tutoring,) and developed a wait list of students.  Through all these opportunities at some point I realized that I loved watching people go from totally lost, to masters of a subject. I was also forced to admit that having all these opportunities continually renewed, I must have been somewhat good at it. So I decided I wanted to teach, which fits with my mission oriented personality. I saw a serious lack of passionate ECE professors in the institutions I attended. At WSU I continued this trend by being ask to TA for computer science and electrical engineering, being a TA for a total of 4 semesters. This continued by getting an amazing opportunity in my first semester at Washington State University to work at Digilent, an educational company. So even if I didn’t want to teach, turns out I can’t avoid it. Luckily it is my main passion.

More Growth for Brands and Retailers: MyFavorito and 500 Startups Team Up to Supercharge B2C CRM


Press Release
-


									updated: Dec 2, 2016							

 





			Mountain View, California, 
			December 2, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​MyFavorito announces that 500 Startups, one of Silicon Valley’s most active and influential investors, has joined its mission to unlock CRM for B2C brands and retailers. MyFavorito is an open CRM-tech platform, built for brands and retailers to establish highly active, personal relationships with their millions of customers and increase store visits and sales significantly. Initial customers such as McDonald’s and Diageo built 20 times more customer relationships on MyFavorito than on typical ad-tech / social media platforms and achieved much higher engagement rates. Teaming up with 500 Startups now gives MyFavorito access to invaluable resources to unlock CRM for many more B2C customers in North America and worldwide. 
“Traditional one-to-many marketing is broken for most brands and retailers and does not provide significant growth potential anymore. MyFavorito enables them to unlock their number one growth driver: Highly active, personal relationships with their millions of customers. Reaching the right customer at the right time with the right message or offer generates additional store visits, loyalty, referrals, sales and ultimately growth. CRM is a standard in the B2B world. With MyFavorito we offer B2C companies a ready-to-go, DIY platform to use the very same principles,” says Dirk Schlenzig, CEO and co-founder of MyFavorito.
McDonald’s, one of MyFavorito’s first customers and a major contributor to its product roadmap, used MyFavorito’s “irresistible” engagement tools to motivate several 100,000 customers to download the MyFavorito app and pick their favorite restaurant, thus automatically building a direct relationship and a fast-growing, 360-degree-view customer database full of meaningful user profiles - for the first time ever. Some of their restaurants attracted a business-critical number of 10,000 customer relationships. MyFavorito’s AI-driven sales engine then generated 25,000 additional store visits in less than a year. The engagement rate was more than 20 times higher than leading Ad-tech and social media platforms. Even more importantly, with MyFavorito results are clearly measurable store visits and sales. Not ‘Likes’.

  Last Updated: 29 October 2015 29 October 2015 

This page is a collection of my favorite supplements. These are products that I have used or do currently use as part of my "Better Health" program or have gotten very good reports from others.  I welcome any comments or suggestions you may have. I am always open to learning about new products that may be better than some of those that I currently consider to be at the top of my list. I expect this list will change over time, but do think these are good options.
I have attempted to break them down into categories such as Antimicrobials, Detoxification, and so on.The products listed below are NOT presented in any specific priority. Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting anything listed on this page.

Antimicrobials

Beyond Balance offers comprehensive herbal blends that may be helpful for people dealing with Lyme disease.  Some of their products include MC-BB-1, MC-BAR-1, MC-BAB-1, MC-BAB-2, MC-BAB-3, IMN-R (formerly Immune Restore), IMN-V (formerly ImmunoVira), MC-REGENATO-1, MC-PROTA-Z, ENV-NM, Parazomin, and others.  I personally have been on protocols incorporating these products and have seen very positive shifts.  More details on these products can be found here.  Custom protocols can be developed by Susan McCamish CTN via Better Health as discussed in my blog entry here.Sources: Beyond Balance

Supreme Nutrition Morinda Supreme, Vital Guard Supreme, Melia Supreme, and Golden Thread Supreme

Some of my absolute favorite products come from Supreme Nutrition.  Morinda Supreme has been helpful for both Babesia and Bartonella.  Vital Guard Supreme may be useful for Borrelia.  Melia Supreme is very broad-spectrum (as are many of the antimicrobials from Supreme Nutrition), and Golden Thread Supreme may be helpful for those dealing with Protomyxzoa rheumatica.Sources: Supreme Nutrition

Maypa Herbals Formula-L, Formula-Bart, Formula-Bab, and Formula-Green

The Maypa Herbals products were formulated by an herbalist and medical intuitive.  They are a unique combination of herbs that I have found very helpful.  I used these products for almost a full year with good results.  I find that they can be very effective but do not seem to product the same Herxheimer response that many other options do.Sources: Maypa Herbals


NutraMedix Samento, Cumanda, Banderol, Enula, Mora, Lakato, Hottuynia


NutraMedix Samento, Cumanda, Banderol, Enula, Mora, Lakato, and Hottuynia are excellent herbal preparations that can be helpful to inhibit the growth and presence of various microbes. I personally have used Samento and have alternated between Cumanda and Banderol on regular cycles. Enula and Mora may be a good option for intracellular infections such as Babesia.  I have used them both.If one is looking for options other than antibiotics, the "Cowden Protocol" which is based on NutraMedix products is a very well-planned treatment option that you may wish to consider in conjunction with your healthcare provider.Sources: Immune Matrix, LLC , NutraMedix Additional Information: NutraMedix

BioPure Quintessence

BioPure Quintessence is as close to the "Buhner protocol in a bottle" that I have seen.  This product is one that I have used along the way for dealing with Lyme and related infections.  It is one of the key components of the Klinghardt Lyme Cocktail discussed here.Sources: BioPure

Systemic Formulas TVIVI

Systemic Formulas TVIVI is one of my go-to remedies for viral issues.
Sources: Systemic Formulas

Seagate Olive Leaf

Seagate Olive Leaf may be very useful in dealing with viral issues.

Immune Modulation and Support

Myco Formulas Immune Defense

One of my more recent favorites is Myco Formulas Immune Defense.  It is a blend of many mushrooms that may support the immune system and fortify the body's response to various microbes.
Sources: Myco Formulas


Transfer Factor LymPlus and Transfer Factor PlasMyc


Transfer Factor LymPlus is a transfer factor product that may be useful for people with Lyme and co-infections as well as some of the major viruses such as EBV, CMV, and HHV6. I started taking this at a dosage of 1 capsule at bedtime for the first month and then increased to 2 capsules each night at bedtime. Transfer Factor PlasMyc is another excellent product from the same company that supports the body against numerous microbial attacks, including Mycoplasma.Sources: Immune Matrix, LLC Additional Information: Researched Nutritionals

Researched Nutritionals Transfer Factor Multi-Immune

Researched Nutritionals offers Transfer Factor Multi-Immune which may be a good option for supporting immune function and addressing various microbial infestations.  I think that many of us focus so much on Lyme that we overlook all of the viruses that are also impacting our health.  Having a product like Transfer Factor Multi-Immune in a protocol may be a very wise way to support the immune system to address things that are not always considered.
Additional Information: Researched Nutritionals 

General Detoxification

Beyond Balance TOX-EASE, TOX-EASE GL, TOX-EASE II 

TOX-EASE, TOX-EASE GL, and TOX-EASE II are blends of numerous herbs that may support optimal detoxification.  I have used these product several times during my recovery and find them to be very useful options in supporting the body's ability to detoxify. More details on these products can be found here.  Custom protocols can be developed by Susan McCamish CTN via Better Health as discussed in my blog entry here.Sources: Beyond Balance


Pekana Homeopathics (apo-HEPAT, RENELIX, ITIRES)


Pekana Homeopathics (apo-HEPAT, RENELIX, ITIRES) are some of the best homeopathic products I have used to support drainage and detoxification.  They are for the liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system respectively.  They may be a good base for supporting the body's ability to detoxify.  In my opinion, everyone with Lyme disease should talk with their doctor about adding these into their foundational program. I've also had excellent results with TOXEX and MUNDIPUR which are both from Pekana.  The only caveat here is that at times, apo-Hepat, can be too provoking and may be best replaced with Syntrion SyDetox using SyDetox, RENELIX, and ITIRES.Sources: Forrest Health Additional Information: BioResource, Inc.


Healthforce Intestinal Drawing Formula 


Healthforce Intestinal Drawing Formula is a powerful binder for many different toxins. It includes Zeolite, Charcoal, Bentonite Clay, and other detoxification-supporting substances.Sources: iHerb.com

BioPure Chlorella

BioPure Chlorella has been a staple in my recovery.  I often chewed 30-40 tablets about 30-45 minutes before a meal.   There are so many benefits to chlorella including that it may be helpful for detoxification of heavy metals.  BioPure carries a high quality chlorella product that is what I personally use.  Jarrow carries a number of chlorella products as well such as Yaeyama Chlorella.Sources: BioPure

ACZ Nano is a zeolite spray that I have used extensively over the past couple of years.  More details on this product can be found in my article entitled Total Body Detox: A Novel Approach to Lowering Total Body Burden.
Sources: Longevity Plus Additional Information: Results RNA
Note: There has been a lot of discussion on whether or not the aluminum contained in zeolite products is a potential problem or not.  I do personally like ACZ Nano, but it is known that zeolites contain aluminum.  Many suggest that the aluminum does not remain behind in the body, but others disagree. Do your research and discuss with your doctor before deciding whether or not zeolite is right for you.

Inflammation


Life Enhancement NanoCurcuminoids


Life Enhancement NanoCurcuminoids is a product I used to reduce inflammation.  It is also sometimes used in the Klinghardt Cocktail.Sources: iHerb.com

Natura Health Products Vital Adapt

Vital Adapt is a product I learned about in early 2010 at a Klinghardt conference.  It is created by Donnie Yance, a well-known herbalist.  It contains a number of adaptogens that may be helpful for those of us with chronic illnesses, high stress lives, burnt out adrenals, and more.  A product data sheet can be found here.
Sources: Natura Health Products


Rhodiola Rosea


Rhodiola Rosea is a product that a practitioner suggested for adrenal support.  It was one of the only things I did to support my adrenals after we found that I had Stage 4 Adrenal exhaustion.

Carlson's Norwegian Salmon Oil 


Carlson's Norwegian Salmon Oil is another excellent product and one of several fish oils I use daily.

Probiotics
Please see my Probiotics page for more information.  I am a big fan of rotating probiotics.  While I have one or two that I use fairly consistently, I like to rotate in other brands so that I'm not using all of the same ones everyday.  I think it is ideal to rotate probiotics over time.

Nexabiotics


Nexabiotics is another favorite.  It has 20 different beneficial strains and is priced very reasonably.  Plus, they offer a money-back guarantee.  Not bad!
