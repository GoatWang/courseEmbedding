PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK & ELIZABETH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hayward Industries, Inc. (“Hayward” or “the Company”) today announced that a partnership led by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP (“CCMP”) and MSD Partners, L.P. (“MSD Partners”) and including the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (“AIMCo”), has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hayward. Hayward is a leading global manufacturer of residential and commercial pool equipment, with an over 90 year history of supplying high quality, technologically advanced products that improve the pool experience for consumers. Clark Hale, current President and CEO of Hayward, and his management team will retain an ownership interest in the business. 





Founded in 1925, Hayward is a global market leader in the residential and commercial swimming pool equipment industry with the most recognized brand and largest installed base in North America. Under the Davis family leadership for more than 50 years, and with the contributions and support of Oscar and Robert Davis, Hayward has grown through organic development and strategic acquisitions to expand its product offering to include a complete line of pumps, filters, heaters, cleaners, sanitizers, IoT driven automation and controls, lighting and accessories, and has built its global footprint through acquisitions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. Driven by its superior engineering and manufacturing capabilities, customer relationships and successful acquisition integration, Hayward has achieved an average annual growth rate above 10% since the Davis family initially purchased control of the business in 1964.
“We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in the pool equipment market. Since the purchase of control of Hayward by the Davis family in 1964, the Company has grown from a regional pool equipment supplier to a global leader with a track record of product innovation and world class supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,” said Mark McFadden, a Managing Director at CCMP. “We look forward to working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the company’s outstanding record of growth.” 





“We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s management in this seminal event in the Company’s distinguished history, and we are pleased to be trusted with the stewardship of the business in the next chapter of its evolution,” said Kevin Brown, a Managing Director in the Private Capital Group at MSD Partners. “Hayward is a perfect fit with MSD Private Capital Group’s strategy of investing in companies that can deliver stability and growth over the long term, and we look forward to supporting its continued growth.”
“I am extremely proud of the accomplishments realized by our team in positioning Hayward as a leading provider of pool equipment throughout the world. As I approach retirement, I am very confident this next generation of ownership will carry on the Hayward tradition and that our legacy is in excellent hands,” said Robert Davis, Co-Chairman of the Board of Hayward.
Clark Hale, President and CEO of Hayward added “Hayward and its employees are forever grateful for the vision and leadership that Oscar and Robert Davis have provided. We now look forward to partnering with CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, geographic expansions, and synergistic acquisitions.”
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. Houlihan Lokey is serving as financial advisor to CCMP, MSD Partners, and AIMCo on the transaction, with Bank of America serving as co-advisor. Bank of America, Jefferies, Morgan Stanley, and Nomura are providing the financing. Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel to the consortium and to CCMP. Dechert and Hogan Lovells are acting as legal counsel to MSD Partners and Torys is acting as legal counsel to AIMCo. Goldman Sachs is serving as financial advisor to Hayward and McCarter & English, LLP is acting as legal counsel.

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.




Chase Capital Partners Logo (1996-2000)






JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]
Investments[edit]

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]
Investments[edit]
CCMP manages both the JP Morgan Partners Global Fund and CCMP Capital Investors II. Among CCMP's investments are the following portfolio companies:

1-800-Flowers[15]

Email: pr@hayward.com

ELIZABETH, NJ (June 19, 2017) — Hayward Industries, Inc. (“Hayward” or “the Company”) today announced that a partnership led by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP and MSD Partners, L.P. and including Alberta Investment Management Corporation, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hayward.
Founded in 1925, Hayward is a global market leader in the residential and commercial swimming pool equipment industry with the most recognized brand and largest installed base in North America. Under the Davis family leadership for more than 50 years, Hayward has grown through organic development and strategic acquisitions to expand its product offering to include a complete line of pumps, filters, heaters, cleaners, sanitizers, IoT driven automation and controls, lighting and accessories, and has built its global footprint through acquisitions in North America, Canada, Europe and Australia. Driven by its superior engineering and manufacturing capabilities, customer relationships and successful acquisition integration, Hayward has achieved an average annual growth rate above 10% since the Davis family initially purchased control of the business in 1964.

“I am extremely proud of the accomplishments realized by our team in positioning Hayward as a leading provider of pool equipment throughout the world. As I approach retirement, I am very confident this next generation of ownership will carry on the Hayward tradition and that our legacy is in excellent hands,” said Robert Davis, Co- Chairman of the Board of Hayward. Clark Hale, President and CEO of Hayward added, "Hayward and its employees are forever grateful for the vision and leadership that Oscar and Robert Davis have provided. We now look forward to partnering with CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, geographic expansion, and synergistic acquisitions.”
 
 “We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in the pool equipment market. Through two generations of Davis family leadership, the Company has grown from a regional pool equipment supplier to a global leader with a track record of product innovation and world class supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,” said Mark McFadden, a Managing Director at CCMP. “We look forward to working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the company’s outstanding record of growth.”

 “We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s management, in this seminal event in the Company’s distinguished history, and we are pleased to be trusted with the stewardship of the business in the next chapter of its evolution,” said Kevin Brown, a Managing Director in the Private Capital Group at MSD Partners. “Hayward is a perfect fit with MSD Private Capital Group’s strategy of investing in companies that can deliver stability and growth over the long term, and we look forward to supporting its continued growth.”

 Recent acquisitions by Hayward Industries include Poolvergnuegen, a suction cleaner manufacturer in the United States, as well as Kripsol, a Spanish based manufacturer of residential and commercial pumps and filters, and Sugar Valley, a Spanish based manufacturer of intelligent automation systems, water chemistry and sanitization products.
 In recent years, Hayward has introduced category leading products such as the OmniLogic® pool control
system, TriStar® variable speed pumps which are rated highest in energy efficiency by the U.S. EPA, V- Flex pool cleaners, and HCP 3000 Series commercial pumps. The transaction is expected to close in the
third quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. Goldman Sachs is serving as financial advisor to Hayward and McCarter & English, LLP is acting as legal counsel.

NEW YORK & ELIZABETH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hayward Industries, Inc. (“Hayward” 
      or “the Company”) today announced 
      that a partnership led by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP (“CCMP”) 
      and MSD Partners, L.P. (“MSD Partners”) 
      and including the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (“AIMCo”), 
      has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hayward. Hayward is a 
      leading global manufacturer of residential and commercial pool 
      equipment, with an over 90 year history of supplying high quality, 
      technologically advanced products that improve the pool experience for 
      consumers. Clark Hale, current President and CEO of Hayward, and his 
      management team will retain an ownership interest in the business.

      annual growth rate above 10% since the Davis family initially purchased 
      control of the business in 1964.
    

      “We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, 
      which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in 
      the pool equipment market. Since the purchase of control of Hayward by

      said Mark McFadden, a Managing Director at CCMP. “We look forward to 
      working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the 
      company’s outstanding record of growth.”
    

      “We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s

      The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, 
      subject to customary closing conditions. Houlihan Lokey is serving as 
      financial advisor to CCMP, MSD Partners, and AIMCo on the transaction,

Hayward Industries buys Spain’s Kripsol Group
                    Hayward Industries Inc has acquired Kripsol Group, a Spanish manufacturer of swimming pool equipment, industrial filtration, pumps, and fire suppression systems.

CCMP Capital and MSD Partners to buy pool pump manufacturer Hayward Industries
20 June 2017
A partnership led by CCMP Capital Advisors LP and MSD Partners LP and including Alberta Investment Management Corp, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire pool equipment manufacturer Hayward Industries Inc.
Founded in 1925, Elizabeth, New Jersey-headquartered Hayward Industries is a global manufacturer of residential and commercial pool equipment and industrial flow control products with facilities in the US, Canada, France, Spain, China and Australia.
Hayward’s pool equipment includes pumps, filters, heaters, cleaners, salt chlorinators, automation, lighting, safety and flow control products. Pump brands include TriStar, Super Pump, MaxFlow and PowerFlo.
Hayward has delivered average annual growth of more than 10% since the Davis family initially acquired control of the business in 1964. The company has grown organically and through a number of strategic acquisitions in North America, Canada, Europe and Australia. Recent acquisitions include the 2016 purchase of Kripsol, a Spanish manufacturer of residential and commercial pumps and filters.
 
“I am extremely proud of the accomplishments realized by our team in positioning Hayward as a leading provider of pool equipment throughout the world. As I approach retirement, I am very confident this next generation of ownership will carry on the Hayward tradition and that our legacy is in excellent hands,” said Robert Davis, co-chairman of the board of Hayward.
 
Clark Hale, president and CEO of Hayward, said: “Hayward and its employees are forever grateful for the vision and leadership that Oscar and Robert Davis have provided. We now look forward to partnering with CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, geographic expansion, and synergistic acquisitions.”
 
“We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in the pool equipment market. Through two generations of Davis family leadership, the company has grown from a regional pool equipment supplier to a global leader with a track record of product innovation and world class supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,” said Mark McFadden, a managing director at CCMP. “We look forward to working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the company’s outstanding record of growth.”
 
“We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s management, in this seminal event in the company’s distinguished history, and we are pleased to be trusted with the stewardship of the business in the next chapter of its evolution,” said Kevin Brown, a managing director in the Private Capital Group at MSD Partners. “Hayward is a perfect fit with MSD Private Capital Group’s strategy of investing in companies that can deliver stability and growth over the long term, and we look forward to supporting its continued growth.”
 
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
