Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

Use Microsoft Flow to Send SMTP Email – Daniel Glenn

My experiences as a Microsoft MVP, Office 365 & SharePoint Architect, Administrator, and Consultant

Use Microsoft Flow to Send SMTP Email 

 

Microsoft Flow is a new product from Microsoft and I am finding it to be a very useful tool. Flow can be a very convenient resource for sending email alerts when something I set as a ‘trigger’ happens. It is also a superior product to ‘IF This Then That’ products because of Flow’s ability to have many steps and conditions. Flow can be used to send email in several ways, but today I will cover how to set up a custom SMTP connection. Flow is in Preview, so some screens or options shown on this post may change.
NOTE: I am going to show how to set up an SMTP connection to GoDaddy’s email service, but any SMTP service that allows connections will work.
First, go to the GoDaddy website and log into your account. Then, click on your name (#1 below) and then select the Visit My Account link (#2 below).
GoDaddy account
Once you are on your account page, click on the Manage link next to the email listing.
GoDaddy email link
Next, find the account you will be using for your email relay. Select the drop-down menu (#1 below) and then click the Email Setup Center link on the menu (#2 below).
GoDaddy email account selection
When the Email Setup Center page loads, make note of the Outgoing server (SMTP) settings.
GoDaddy SMTP settings
Then head over to the Microsoft Flow website and login. Once you have logged in, click on the person image in the top-right corner (#1 below) and then select My connections in the menu (#2 below).
Microsoft Flow access connections
Select the Add a connection link at the top of the Connections page.
Microsoft Flow add a connection
When the connection types load, select the SMTP link.
Microsoft Flow SMTP link
Then fill out the SMTP connection settings with the information you noted earlier from the GoDaddy Email Setup Center. I am using port 80 and not using SSL encryption in the example below, but you should use security best practices when configuring your service. Click the Create connection link when finished.
Microsoft Flow SMTP settings for GoDaddy
Once the connection is created, create a new Flow. Create a trigger, in the example below I am checking for a Tweet. Then Add an action, and type email (#1 below). This will filter the list of actions to only show email items. Then select the SMTP – Send Email action (#2 below).
Microsoft Flow add SMTP step
Then enter the required information for the email. In the example below, I am sending an email to test@example.com, with an email subject of “New Tweet Appears – [The Tweet text]”, and an email body of “There is a new Tweet by [who created the tweet]!”.
Microsoft Flow SMTP step settings
Finally save your Flow and give it a test. I have found that it might take a minute for the Flow to start checking Twitter, but you should receive an email any time the condition you set is met!
Happy Flow creating!

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline
