Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Certification & Validation 




Services » Certification & Validation


Certifications are needed or requested to demonstrate compliance with legislative or individual requirements. Regardless of the nature of the product or system, certifications provide the client/end user with the desired confidence in terms of safety, reliability, and liability.
The efforts in globalization and resulting global requirements, mandate that products must be accompanied with a technical description and installation / operation / maintenance instructions. Thus the scope of product use is clearly defined and the commissioning tasks at the field of installation find the required support. Operators and legal authorities rely on certifications in order to be able to justify safety and health for all people, animals and the environment within the area of operations.
Certification and Validation of new and proven designs and systems, are performed to make sure that current, good engineering and manufacturing practices are applied, as well as codes and requirements are fulfilled.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

​Your music...our Passion
 Just got my rack. It looks great and took less than five minutes to assemble. I have six guitars in it and they fit perfectly. I love the fact that its not some cheap piece of wood stamped out in a factory. It definitely cleaned up the mess of guitars in the corner of my living room. Joe from NY
Hey Dave and Bob...the stand arrived today, is put together, and works great! When I got married, my guitars and gear left the front living room...of course. Though my wife is a big supporter of my guitar playing, the guitars and amps are not her favorite decor. However, when she saw how beautiful and functional my new ECE bamboo guitar stand was - she enthusiastically welcomed it (and the guitars) back into the living room. Great work guys!​Mark from WA

How Companies Use A Predictable Marketing Business System toIncrease Market Share and Drive Up Revenue
AND Get an Immediate Return on their Marketing Investment
Expanding your company’s marketplace awareness and growing sales revenue is a daily struggle.
Regardless of the type of services or products your company provides to the market, at the end of the day there is really only one thing that matters…
Making more sales.
Consistent sales revenue supports the long-term goal: Staying profitable and keeping the doors open for business.
 
 
The Problem:
How can you get more clients and get an immediate return on your marketing investment at the same time?
The fact is, it’s a common problem that only a few have the ability to solve.
First, most marketing firms cannot (and will not) tell you how and when you will get a return on your investment.
The reason why is frankly, because they either don’t know or it’s so far in the future they don’t want you thinking about it.
Second, their team simply cannot deliver the exact results you want right now… and in the future.
So, what this means is, you wind up spending a rather large amount of your marketing budget on “marketing strategies” that yield poor results and leave little in your bank account.
 
 
Get Results Now!
You want predictable, measurable, positive results that will grow your bottom-line right away with the least amount of expense.
And this just so happens to be what we do best.
It starts with a simple conversation to understand your business goals.
It ends with a Marketing Business System that takes you there.
Everything we do is designed around marketing your company and bringing in new clients – we don’t simply place you in a one-size-fits-all program because frankly, they never really work the way you are told they will… do they?
We not only get you the kind of results you’ve always wanted, but we do it in a way that is profitable for you.

“Over the last 3 years ECE Marketing Services has been outstanding for our SaaS mobile platform. We are driving highly targeted traffic from their work. These visitors stay on our site the longest, opt-in to our free trial, and become paying clients.”
Brian Anderson, President, MobileBizBox




 
How We Get You More Clients
We use a propriety marketing system called Enhanced Conditional Engagement (ECE) which attracts the people who are most likely to purchase your products and services, and gets them to engage your business right away.
This means, within days you’ll have a steady stream of new clients flowing to your business AND you’ll be getting them at a profit.
No waiting months for results. 
No spending thousands of dollars on weak, budget-draining marketing.
No wondering when you’re going to get clients and turn a profit.
We’ll tell you right upfront how and when it will happen for you… before we decide to work together.
 
 
Take the Next Step…
Give us a call today and discover how easy it is to bring your marketing efforts to a better place and get more new clients in the next few weeks.
Build marketplace awareness. Get the clients you need. Drive up your sales revenue. Consistently feed the sales team quality inbound leads.
