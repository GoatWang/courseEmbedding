November 20, 2013 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time 
 SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NanoString Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSTG), a provider of life science tools for translational research and molecular diagnostic products, today announced the appointment of David W. Ghesquiere as Senior Vice President, Corporate & Business Development, effective immediately. In this role, Mr. Ghesquiere will work with NanoString’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Gray, to shape the strategy of the company while leading NanoString’s corporate and business development efforts. His responsibilities will include pursuing growth-oriented collaborations, transactions and strategic initiatives to leverage and build the company’s technology base, diagnostic test pipeline and other value drivers. 
 Mr. Ghesquiere joins NanoString with over 20 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry in both North America and Europe. Mr. Ghesquiere was most recently Senior Vice President, Corporate & Business Development at Dendreon Corporation, where his primary responsibility was leading the strategic process to identify and pursue next generation technologies and therapeutics. Previously, he was an executive at OSI Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Astellas) where from 2005 to 2010 he held positions of increasing responsibility including Senior Vice-President of Corporate & Business Development, and served as a Board Member and Managing Director & Secretary of OSI Investment Holdings GmbH / OSI Investment Management GmbH. Earlier in his career, Mr. Ghesquiere was Director of Global Business Development for Aventis Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Sanofi) and worked in product marketing at Johnson & Johnson. 
 “David has a deep background in the drug development industry and oncology, two areas of importance to our strategy,” said Brad Gray, President and CEO of NanoString Technologies. “The addition of David to our executive team will accelerate our efforts to strengthen our menu of molecular diagnostics, and extend our reach and impact in the area of oncology drug development.” 
 “I believe that molecular diagnostics, and NanoString’s nCounter technology in particular, will play an important role in improving the lives of patients with cancer and other diseases as the vision of personalized medicine becomes a reality,” said Mr. Ghesquiere. “I am delighted to join the company to help map out the future for this disruptive technology platform with the potential to revolutionize the practice of oncology.” 
 The nCounter Analysis System for research applications, and the nCounter Dx Analysis System for high-complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories are highly automated and easy-to-use platforms that utilize NanoString’s novel digital barcoding chemistry to deliver high precision multiplexed assays. The nCounter Dx Analysis System supports the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay, an in vitro diagnostic assay that uses the gene expression profile of cells found in breast cancer tissue to assess a patient’s risk of distant recurrence of disease. The Prosigna Assay is the first in what the company expects to be a portfolio of genomic assays that will benefit cancer patients and oncologists in making treatment decisions.

      President and CEO of NanoString Technologies. “The addition of David to 
      our executive team will accelerate our efforts to strengthen our menu of 
      molecular diagnostics, and extend our reach and impact in the area of 
      oncology drug development.”
    
      “I believe that molecular diagnostics, and NanoString’s nCounter 
      technology in particular, will play an important role in improving the 
      lives of patients with cancer and other diseases as the vision of 
      personalized medicine becomes a reality,” said Mr. Ghesquiere. “I am 
      delighted to join the company to help map out the future for this 
      disruptive technology platform with the potential to revolutionize the 
      practice of oncology.”
    
      The nCounter Analysis System for research applications, and the nCounter 
      Dx Analysis System for high-complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories are 
      highly automated and easy-to-use platforms that utilize NanoString’s 
      novel digital barcoding chemistry to deliver high precision multiplexed 
      assays. The nCounter Dx Analysis System supports the Prosigna Breast 
      Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay, an in vitro diagnostic 
      assay that uses the gene expression profile of cells found in breast 
      cancer tissue to assess a patient’s risk of distant recurrence of 
      disease. The Prosigna Assay is the first in what the company expects to 
      be a portfolio of genomic assays that will benefit cancer patients and 
      oncologists in making treatment decisions.
    


About NanoString Technologies, Inc.

      NanoString Technologies provides life science tools for translational 
      research and molecular diagnostic products. The company's nCounter® 
      Analysis System, which has been employed in basic and translational 
      research since it was first introduced in 2008 and cited in more than 
      300 peer-reviewed publications, has also now been applied to diagnostic 
      use as the nCounter Dx Analysis System. The company's technology offers 
      a cost-effective way to easily profile the expression of hundreds of 
      genes, miRNAs, or copy number variations, simultaneously with high 
      sensitivity and precision. The company's technology enables a wide 
      variety of basic research and translational medicine applications, 
      including biomarker discovery and validation. The nCounter-based 
      Prosigna™ Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay is the first in 
      vitro diagnostic assay to be marketed through the company's 
      diagnostics business. The nCounter Dx Analysis System is FDA 510(k) 
      cleared for use with the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene 
      Signature Assay; to date, it has not been cleared by the FDA for other 
      indications or for use with other assays. The Prosigna Assay has been 
      CE-marked and is available for use by healthcare professionals in the 
      European Union and other countries that recognize the CE Mark and in 
      which Prosigna is registered. For more information, please visit www.nanostring.com.
