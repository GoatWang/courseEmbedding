 Educational Background



Bachelor of Business Administration, summa cum laude 


The University of Tulsa

                  The University of Tulsa's mission is nurtured and supported by:

    exceptional faculty, who draw students into the pursuit of knowledge, introducing them to the pleasures and responsibilities of the life of the mind in a challenging world, and who include in their numbers the 1998-99 Carnegie Foundation Professor of the Year for all U.S. doctoral and research universities, a national Carnegie Foundation Pew Scholar, a Carnegie Foundation Professor of the Year for Oklahoma, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and four Fellows of the Institute for Advanced Study.
    a humanities-based general curriculum that stimulates scientific, social, and artistic inquiry, while stressing competence in oral and written communication;
    graduate, professional, and research programs that foster advanced theoretical development, promote professional preparation, enhance the quality of the faculty, and extend the University's international reach;
    substantial library resources and information technology that support research and classroom learning;
    a residential campus that fosters a sense of community and integrates curricular and extracurricular life; and
    abundant opportunities for students to undertake community service, internships, and study abroad; to participate in substantive research, often as early as the freshman year; and to study and reflect in ways that foster intellectual, spiritual, and moral growth.

TU's 200-acre campus is located two miles east of downtown Tulsa, a metropolitan city with a population exceeding a half a million people. The city's remarkable cultural, technological, and economic resources nourish the University's mission and enrich its life, just as the University, in turn, enriches the city.

In its vibrant urban environment, The University of Tulsa offers a diversity of learning experiences, a balance between career preparation and liberal education, teaching, and research, and endeavors to instill in its students an understanding that stature as an individual and value as a member of society depend upon continual learning
