Context, a recruitment panacea Spire Talent Acquisition- Intelligence based Hiring Technology Contextual search & match for 70% interview-to-select, 50% cost savings, 40% time-to-hire decrease
Corporate recruitment is about fitting the right talent to the right job which seems simple indeed with both demand (job description) and supply (resumes) digitized. However, the discovery of relevant talent rarely generates euphoria due to challenge in quantifying – how much ‘right fit’ is the best available talent or whether ‘better fit’ talent is available and overlooked.  Existing ATS automation tools only provide workflow automation and basic search options for hiring. Enterprise recruiters need contextual search and match technology to get results based on the relevance of talent to the enterprise, rather than search query.
 
Spire Talent Acquisition complements your ATS to help hire the most relevant talent, instantly


Spire Talent Acquisition is an operational analytics and hiring solution which can accurately match and map candidate resumes to job descriptions and vice versa like a domain expert. It gives 95% accuracy in contextual search and 80% accuracy in bi-directional mapping which is way ahead than what existing systems do. Spire Talent Acquisition can search up to a mind-boggling 1300 parameters in a matter of few seconds and process thousands of resumes in a few hours, accurately pin-pointing the ‘right’ resumes with contextual intelligence analytics. It can even map competitor data and schedule interviews across locations.
Spire Talent Acquisition can simultaneously process resumes from multiple locations such as job portals, company career pages and social media. To top this, it compares multiple formats including word documents, pdfs, html, emails or just plain text files against each other.

Why SpireSpire recognizes the importance of ‘context’ 90% of all enterprise data world over is unstructured. Only 10% is explored and used.
Organizations depend on data (quantitative and qualitative) to make business decisions. However, most of this data is not ‘contextual’ – meaning it is not yet comprehended in the actual unique context of the business. To make accurate decisions, an organization needs the critical parameters or ‘context’ of data which is ‘unique’ only to it – its purpose, circumstances and environment. Spire is a pioneer of context intelligence (CI). Spire recognizes the importance of ‘context’ to business.
 


1. Spire context intelligence platform
The Spire context intelligence platform comprehends unstructured, multi-format, qualitative data be it any form (text, audio, video) by converting it into comprehensible bits. This is then interpreted ‘contextually,’ in the ‘relevant’ context of a business resulting in unprecedented analytics which can empower decisions for direct impact on cost savings, drive revenues up and reduce operational time significantly.

The Spire CI platform enables powerful ‘data-driven’ and ‘meaningful’ decisions for accelerating business outcomes. The platform generates ‘contextual’ meaning out of any data with a search capability that is 95% accurate with two distinct capabilities.


Unstructured data comprehension: Till date, machines have been unable to compute unstructured data which is qualitative and remains unexplored. Spire technology is a pioneer in converting this unstructured, multi-format, qualitative data into comprehensible and analyzable formats. This enables organizations mine their valuable unexplored data and bring it to use.


Contextual data analysis: While data and data analyses are ‘objective’, data interpretation is ‘relative’, i.e., it is ‘contextual’. Spire recognizes this importance of context and hence all analyses done for business applications by the platform are in the context of the enterprise (user). Spire uses proprietary context clouds for contextual search, match and data analytics.
The Spire CI platform helps make accurate and meaningful decisions for decision makers and can be used in any business domain.




2. TalentSHIP, is an enabler of talent computing for enhanced profits
Spire TalentSHIP® is a cloud-based solution which uses the prowess of the Spire CI platform. It is an instantiation of CI technology in the talent domain.
Business leaders comprehend human capital efficiency measures by using various HRIS, HRMS, ATS solutions available in the market. All these systems do linear process automation with minimal analytics as all talent related data is qualitative an unstructured by nature. Resumes, skill sets and employee/job seeker profiles exist in multiple formats and keep changing. Spire TalentSHIP® is an enabler of talent computing to enhance profits. Spire context intelligence (CI) technology has the capability to not only comprehend unstructured data but also contextually analyse it to accelerate business outcomes.
Spire TalentSHIP® is a cloud based solution comprising of a suite of 5 products, each of which address a different part of the human capital supply chain. They could be used in three ways –

4. Unstructured Big Data
Spire solutions are designed to evaluate your Big Data making decision making more meaningful to your business. Spire can better your decision making process; Better decision making results in improved efficiencies and productivity, reduced lead times resulting in better knowledge of the market, management and location strategy formulated on ‘live & definite’ market data. Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) the world’s leading information technology research and advisory company has defined Big data as ” high-volume, high-velocity and high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making.” Simply put, it is data sets that—due to their size (volume), the speed they are created with (velocity), and the type of information they contain (variety)—are pushing the existing infrastructure to its limits.

In selecting a technique or technology, enterprises should first perform an information audit assessing the status of their information supply chain to identify and prioritize particular data management issues. Variety of Data, deals with structured and unstructured data. The greatest barrier perceived by most organizations to effective data management exists due to the variety of incompatible data formats, nonaligned data structures, and inconsistent data semantics. Spire solutions address a part of this challenge as it is designed to assess your businesses quantitative & qualitative inputs; these inputs can be fed into the tool as data text or audio inputs. In addition Spire solutions give you the insight of assessing the data bi-directionally. This mean the output you receive can be mapped based on “supply to demand” or “demand to supply”, resulting in unprecedented analytics which can give your business a positive impact of 9x.
To know how this can work for your business write to us at engage@spire2grow.com for a demonstration of Spire solutions.
 


5. Contextual Search
Enterprise Search platforms (ESP) are used to describe the software of search information within an enterprise search can be contrasted with web search, which applies search technology to documents on the open web, and desktop search, which applies search technology to the content on a single computer.
 

Enterprise search systems index data and documents from a variety of sources such as: file systems, intranets, document management systems, e-mail, and databases. Many enterprise search systems integrate structured and unstructured data in their collections use access controls to enforce a security policy on their users. Enterprise search can be seen as a type of vertical search of an enterprise which focuses on a specific segment of online content.
 
The good news is that Spires’s technology will work in tandem with your existing ESPs. Spire technology will help in making the content you currently search more relevant; enabling you to take informed and accurate business decisions.
 



6. Richness Index
 
When you enter a search word in the Spire platform, the Spire Richness Index™ helps determine the strength of relevance of the ‘context’ of the search word. Technically, it is a composite, multi-dimensional measure of the degree of significance and relevance of the ‘context’ of supply pool to the ‘context’ of the specified demand (search term).
 
In addition, Spire gives the insight of assessing data bi-directionally. This means the output you receive can be mapped based on “supply to demand” or “demand to supply”, resulting inunprecedented analytics which can give businesses a positive impact of 9 times greater efficiency.

Spire Technologies Inc. (OTC: SPTK) Announces a Memorandum of Understanding to Acquire and Launch Web-Based Student Housing Platform

VANCOUVER, Oct. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Spire Technologies Inc. ("Spire") (OTC: SPTK) announces an agreement with DormBooker Inc.("DormBooker" or "the Company"), which will see DormBooker's principals, industry veterans, Amyn Diamond Murji ("Murji"), Jeff Zigman ("Zigman"), & Mayur Patil ("Patil"), become Senior Consultant Executives in Spire's wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of acquiring DormBooker, a business similar to Airbnb, but specific to the student housing market.








DormBooker is a student housing booking platform that allows students to search for and book suitable living accommodations using their preferred criteria, in whichever city around the world they are pursuing their studies.  This will simplify the students' search significantly while also giving landlords an easy and convenient way to rent out their properties with minimal effort.  With over 10 years of experience in running their own student housing, they successfully beta tested the concept on their own student housing facilities and are now ready to roll out the platform to the $45.1B North American Student Housing Market, according to Concordia Small Business Consulting Bureau, which completed the Company's research and business plan.  
Amyn Murji commented on the business dynamics: "We have found that with the number of young people around the world pursuing higher education, as well as, the amount of students travelling outside of their own cities and often their own countries in order to pursue their studies, there is a massive amount of demand for student housing in cities across the world."  International students' spending in all 50 States contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy in 2013.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2015, approximately 20.2 million students were expected to attend American colleges and universities. However, what we have found is that there is often little to no guidance for these students to find a place to live when arriving in their city of choice.  With DormBooker students eliminate the need to search several different websites in order to compare their options and it also allows students to highlight the criteria that is most important to them, whether it be proximity, budget or certain facility requirements or preferences.  On the flip side of the coin, many landlords face challenges in ensuring their properties get the right type of exposure, as well as, challenges relating to all of the back and forth that is often required in order to rent out a unit to a student often in another time zone.  DormBooker will simplify the process for everyone involved.  
Murji and Zigman are confident that the DormBooker platform is a robust and integrated platform fully engineered to meet all expectations of both landlords and students. Zigman added: "With a low cost structure and our solid experience in the industry, DormBooker has the potential to become a dominant player in an already attractive student housing market and the capability to seize the opportunities of other markets. With our diversified backgrounds and experience, we are confident that we can quickly become every student's first stop when looking for accommodations.  We truly believe that our focus on simplifying every part of the process for all parties, and fusing this with being part of the hyper successful online booking industry will be the foundation of our success".
The Company believes Murji, Zigman, Patil, are uniquely qualified to develop the DormBooker business with Spire.  Together, they have decades of branded digital content creation, marketing, development, sales, and customer service experience.  
Amyn Diamond Murji is a Canadian born and based businessman, with over 20 years experience in the dot.com, customer service, and real estate industries. During his years in real estate, Amyn built and managed retail, industrial, and student housing. Having managed student housing for 10 years, he understands student housing on several levels. It was from this experience in the student housing industry that the idea for DormBooker originated. Amyn has a B.A. from Concordia University.
Jeff Zigman graduated from McGill Electrical Engineering in 2008 and has been involved in software since high school. He played a large role in the design of the BlackBerry mobile applications of Securitas and VIA Rail, among others, and he started and led several startups of his own before DormBooker, perfecting and solidifying his expertise in software design, project management, and testing. He has been the Chief Technical Officer of DormBooker since development began at the beginning of 2014.
Mayur Patil has his Masters in Computer Science from Concordia University and has been Lead Developer at DormBooker since its inception. Having developed the core code of DormBooker, he continues its ongoing development, while establishing programming guidelines and overseeing the code of other developers.
