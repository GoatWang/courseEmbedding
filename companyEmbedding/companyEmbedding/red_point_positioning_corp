Home   /   Redpoint RTLS Technology   /   Open API
Integration Made Easy
Redpoint Positioning’s solution easily integrates into existing applications and enterprise software using well documented interfaces.
Server API
Accessing the RTLS Base-station (RBS) provides system-wide knowledge of all of the infrastructure and tags. Real-time and historical data is  available. The primary interface for communicating with the RTLS server is based on industry standard Representational State Transfer (REST) calls. This allows third-party code to get and set various parameters within the RTLS system with a minimum of code using common HTTP queries. For example, it is a simple matter to query the system for radio nodes seen within a given time-interval.
For low-latency applications, the RBS also provides a publication/subscription mechanism that allows for push notifications to third-party clients whenever there is an update to position or sensor data. This interface is considerably more efficient then a REST polling mechanism for high-bandwidth applications.
Radio Tag API
Complete system information is available from the RBS API. For navigation applications where only knowledge of a tag’s current position is needed, location data is made available at the RTLS tag. This may be read via serial port connection to the on-board UART, or via the integrated Bluetooth radio.

Home   /   RTLS Applications   /   Employee Safety 


Redpoint RTLS Keeps Employees Safer
In many industries, employee safety is critical. Real-time location and navigation is enabling companies to actively monitor and alert employees to safety concerns as they perform their jobs – or to quickly identify if there is a problem and shorten response time. With real-time location services (RTLS) badges or tags, companies have the ability to mitigate risk of safety issues.

Employees can request help at their specific location by pushing the call button on the Redpoint badge.
Employees carrying the Redpoint badge are instantly alerted when entering pre-defined danger zones on construction jobsites or hazardous workplace areas.
Actuators can be triggered to slow or deactivate heavy equipment when tags move too close or cross thresholds.
Employee locations can be tracked to monitor exposure to hazardous materials, simply by location, or through interfacing with external sensors.

Ready for RTLS? Let’s Go!
The next generation of indoor Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) has arrived, driven by Redpoint’s unique, patent-pending solution that shatters the ultra-wideband (UWB) performance/cost paradigms of yesterday. Redpoint’s high-precision RTLS solution includes all of the key components — from wireless infrastructure hardware to advanced localization engines, system management tools, and application software — to enable a variety of RTLS applications across enterprises.

The platform is designed to support a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking and management, indoor navigation, staff and visitor tracking, and location-enabled sensor data.
Ultimate Performance
Redpoint’s superior performance is driven by the company’s unique location schemes, advanced algorithms, and proprietary protocol stacks. The system can achieve unparalleled location accuracy of less than 0.5 meters, even in highly complex environments. The efficient protocol stack enables the system to reach maximum capacity and is capable of handling a large number of tags.
Intelligent Architecture
Redpoint has a portfolio of patents pending that specifically address some of the challenges faced by traditional UWB-based RTLS solutions. The intelligent wireless infrastructure network is self-organizing, self-calibrating, and self-localizing. The superior architecture and built-in intelligence significantly reduces the deployment time and maintenance requirement, reducing the total cost of ownership.
Ultimate Flexibility
Redpoint RTLS is a highly configurable platform with user-friendly, industrial-standard APIs that allow end users to seamlessly integrate RTLS capabilities into their applications to immediately add real-time tracking, navigation, and data communications.
