GAWK Launches Disruptive Mobile Marketing Product - MarketWatch

















































Bulletin






Investor Alert























press release


					Feb. 15, 2017, 6:03 a.m. EST
				
GAWK Launches Disruptive Mobile Marketing Product
























LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb 15, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 15, 2017) -  Gawk, Inc. (otc pink:GAWK), a cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service company, today announced launch of a new product which provides unprecedented direct message delivery to mobile users and creates a unique, new channel for B2B and B2C users.


                                        








GAWK's new Direct Delivery delivers messages directly into the voicemail box of the user without a ring or alert, meaning the user is required to listen to the message in order to learn who it is from and what it is about.


                                        








During the product's beta testing, response rates increased by up to 80% due to the increase in percentage of those listening to the message, which means a massive boost to ROI in call campaigns.


                                        








GAWK's proprietary software initiates a landline-to-landline session directly with the phone carrier's voicemail system allowing unprecedented reach and deliverability of messages.


                                        








Instead of charging on a per call or per attempt basis, GAWK's service charges its customers only for a successfully delivered message into a target's voicemail.


                                        








"In an environment where consumers quickly adapt and become immune to new promotion channels, marketers need constantly new tools to deliver their message and improve ROI," commented CEO Scott Kettle. "We are excited about gaining marketshare with this unique and disruptive cloud technology."

Unique, direct and compliant marketing access to mobile consumers for GAWK business customers
LOS ANGELES February 15, 2017  Gawk Inc., (OTCPK:GAWK) a cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service company, today announced launch of a new product which provides unprecedented direct message delivery to mobile users and creates a unique, new channel for B2B and B2C users.
GAWK’s new Direct Deliverydelivers messages directly into the voicemail box of the user without a ring or alert, meaning the user is required to listen to the message in order to learn who it is from and what it is about.
During the product’s beta testing, response rates increased by up to 80% due to the increase in percentage of those listening to the message, which means a massive boost to ROI in call campaigns.
GAWK’s proprietary software initiates a landline-to-landline session directly with the phone carrier's’ voicemail system allowing unprecedented reach and deliverability of messages.
Instead of charging on a per call or per attempt basis, GAWK’s service charges its customers only for a successfully delivered message into a target’s voicemail.
“In an environment where consumers quickly adapt and become immune to new promotion channels, marketers need constantly new tools to deliver their message and improve ROI,” commented CEO Scott Kettle. “We are excited about gaining marketshare with this unique and disruptive cloud technology.”
