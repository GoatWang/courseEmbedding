Coordinates: 54°26′04″N 0°32′04″W﻿ / ﻿54.4345°N 0.5344°W﻿ / 54.4345; -0.5344Robin Hood’s Bay is a small fishing village and a bay located within the North York Moors National Park, five miles south of Whitby and 15 miles north of Scarborough on the coast of North Yorkshire, England. Bay Town, its local name, is in the ancient chapelry of Fylingdales in the wapentake of Whitby Strand.The origin of the name is uncertain, and it is doubtful if Robin Hood was ever in the vicinity. An English ballad and legend tell a story of Robin Hood encountering French pirates who came to pillage the fisherman's boats and the northeast coast.

Utilizing a stress reducing Bourdon tube design, movement with hardened components and bearing technology, the XSEL™ process gauge pressure system is capable of producing 10 million or more pressure cycles. 

Due to its greater resistance to vibration and pulsation, the XSEL™ reduces downtime from replacing regularly worn-out instruments and improves safety risks from the release of process media. With positive pressure ranges up to 30,000 psi, a 5 year warranty on the gauge and a 10 year warranty on the pressure system, the WIKA XSEL™ series exceeds industry expectations.

Robert Hutchison


Monday 19 June 2017 08.17 EDT


Last modified on Monday 26 June 2017 07.33 EDT





Robin Murray, who has died aged 76, advocated and implemented new forms of social and economic organisation by applying humanist principles to practical experience. In Britain and internationally he sought to tease out of today’s structures clues for a more equitable tomorrow.
He saw beyond Fordism – industrialised mass production and mass consumption – and neoliberalism, with its emphasis on the private sector and free trade. As chief economic adviser to the Greater London council (1981-86), Robin led a team working for an inclusive, democratic economy. Their London Industrial Strategy involved trade unionists and user groups in economic planning, invested in child care and adult education, developed cultural and creative industries, gave a boost to co-operatives and other social enterprises, and helped set up the London Food Commission, whose work included the study of additives and the effects of food poverty.
Learning from the small-scale enterprises of Emilia-Romagna, the region of Italy with Bologna at its centre, his team encouraged networks of decentralised production units with an emphasis on flexible specialisation, particularly in the furniture industry. This was the enabling state in action.
The influence of this approach went far beyond London and outlived the GLC, led by Ken Livingstone and abolished by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1986. Ever enthusiastic about local democracy, Robin advised a consortium of local authorities that produced the South East Economic Development Strategy, which contributed to the 1997 Labour government setting up Regional Development Agencies.
Drawing on his GLC experience, Robin wrote for Marxism Today on Benetton Britain (1985) and Life After Henry (Ford) (1988) – explaining the post-Fordist transformation of the production process to the wider left. Aware of the widening gap between the market’s winners and losers, Robin argued that the new technological and organisational forms of production could facilitate democratic self-management and collaborative creativity, and help the transition to democratic socialism. Guided by Bertolt Brecht’s maxim that “truth is in the concrete”, he organised a series of initiatives “in the interests of labour rather than of capital”. Self-realisation for the marginalised and exploited, for women, for the young, was at the heart of his mission.
In 1985, with Michael Barratt Brown, Robin founded the Third World Information Network (Twin), a trading organisation designed to ensure economic equity for producers in a global market, and of which he was a director for 20 years. Out of Twin came the trailblazing fair trade brands Cafédirect and Divine Chocolate. In 2008, in Kerala, southwest India, at a global assembly of Liberation Nuts, and in defiance of the company’s perilous financial condition, Robin’s voice boomed out to 3,000 farmers: “We are about people and community.”
Liberation Nuts lives on, the Twin group of companies now acts as a trading and marketing arm for more than 300,000 small farmers, and fair trade sales in the UK in 2016 totalled £1.65bn. It all began with Twin importing cigars from Cuba and rocking chairs from Nicaragua.

From 1994 Robin worked for two years with the province of Ontario. He brought Canadian expertise in sustainability back to England, founding the London Pride Waste Action Programme, which started pilot schemes showing how cost-effective and popular recycling can be with new methods and technologies. Across England recycling rates soared.
His book Creating Wealth from Waste (1999) was followed by the Greenpeace report Zero Waste (2002), in which he argued that product design for repeated use was as important as recycling. His achievements in redirecting UK waste policy led the Guardian to identify him in 2008 as one of the “50 people who could save the planet”.
With the deputy mayor of London he worked to establish the London Climate Change Agency in 2005, and two years later a green homes advice service. For the Young Foundation he co-authored The Open Book of Social Innovation (2010), a worldwide survey and investigation into ways new technology could reduce carbon footprints, sustain health and alleviate poverty – work premised on the belief that only globally equitable approaches would avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change.
His teaching at Schumacher College in Dartington, south Devon, deepened his connection to ecology through economics, combining his knowledge and love of farming and his faith in a sustainable future. More recently he focused on work with co-operatives, believing that they were the appropriate institutional form for a human-centred 21st-century economy.

  Robin Murray speaking at the Fair Trade Alliance Kerala seed festival, 2015 Photograph: Frances Murray


Born in Westmorland (now part of Cumbria), Robin was the son of Stephen Murray and his wife Margaret (nee Gillett), who had a strong Quaker background and in the 1930s were communists. In 1951, his father dropped his legal career and moved his family from Hampstead, north London, to a hill farm in Cumberland, where his sons worked in the school holidays. At Bedales school, Hampshire, he met Frances Herdman, later an artist; together they went to Oxford, where Robin studied history at Balliol College, and married in 1965.
After postgraduate studies at the College of Europe in Bruges, and at the London School of Economics (LSE), Robin taught at the London Business School. For the May Day Manifesto (1968), edited by Raymond Williams, he drafted an alternative economic strategy that became a central issue on the left in Britain in the 1970s.
From 1972 to 1993 Robin worked at the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, and subsequently at the LSE. He advised governments and civil associations in Jamaica, Ethiopia, Honduras, and most recently the Syriza government in Greece. In 1980 he helped establish a new educational system for the then socialist government in the Seychelles. To all his activities he brought optimism, warmth, curiosity and good humour.
He is survived by Frances, his daughters, Marika and Bethany, grandson, Joseph, and brothers, Alexander and Hubert.

Something for entertainment








Film-making
I have experimented with different genres of films and have done scriptwriting, storyboarding, character animation, cinematography, video editing and audio mixing. I like my films to be thought provoking with a touch of humour. When my viewers get the punch, they get the point. Click here to view my showreel.






Magic
Four years back, as an outsider to the art form, it looked like gimmickry that involved fooling people by knowing the "trick". When I started performing, I understood that the "trick" is much more that just knowing the secret. It is a performance art just like dancing and it requires lots and lots of practice. Making someone smile by doing something amusing is a very fulfilling feeling indeed.

Photography
I have always been fascinated about the time capturing device. It somehow teaches me how change is the only constant and everything we have at this point of time is temporary. So, make the most of your time and do whatever you want to do, we only get one shot don't we?

I am
Philosopher, thinker, day-dreamer, illusionist, activist ...











2010-2012
My Humble Beginnings


I started learning the basics of design and animation in 2010. I got certified as an Adobe Certified Associate in Visual Communication in Photoshop CS4. I learnt the craft of film-making and animation by experimenting with different genres. Animated films made using mixed-media always seemed very intriguing to me and so, with my good friends Bertie and Atif, my journey began as a mixed-media film maker. We made "Always Love" which had a stop motion Puppet Band playing the song with a beautiful story running in the background(on the screen). After this, we tried a big gamble with a very challenging project "The Junky Macaque", as all the traditionally animated characters interacted with the stop motion animated props. 









March 2013
Stepping into 3D


Our films were a little dark up till this point of time and we wanted to create something funny yet thought provoking. So I started writing the story of "I wish" which was going to be our first 3D animated movie. It was made for an inter Arena film festival and it was completed with 3 months of sweat and blood. We got an amazing response from the audience when it was screened at the event and we won third prize out of the ten shortlisted entries that came from different zones of north India.









2013-Present
Going International


My work helped me get into an international indie project titled "Dyipoy" and my role changed from an Animator to Concept Artist. The film is still in production and the artists working on it are from different parts of the world collaborating virtually.  









Now
Activism


Life is much more than the self. I started finding happiness in giving a part of myself to things that I wanted to change. I am an active member of The Zeitgeist Movement. It advocates how a Resource Based Economy can avoid all the unnecessary suffering we have in our world today. I also work with an NGO called C.R.Y that works to protect under priveledged children.
