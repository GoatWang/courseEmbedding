What our clients are saying




















































































“No other company understands and delivers on customer experience like McorpCX—they drive measurable results, and can prove it. Their expertise and approach are second to none.” Customer Experience Director, Fortune 500 Technology Firm
“[McorpCX] provided the process, insights and strategic perspective needed to implement a business-focused brand that brought people and divisions together.” CMO, $3.9B Financial Services Company
“The user-centered and co-creative process within McorpCX’s Experience Blueprinting methodology helped us gain alignment between our Store Operations, Retail Operations, and IT organizations.” VP Guest Experience Management (Specialty Retailer)


"Their Touchpoint Mapping® process provided a view into the customer mindset, helping to re-shape key aspects of the business customer experience.” Professional Services Director, Global Telecom
“Our staff delivers better customer experiences, because we’ve been able to see (and close!) key service delivery gaps.” Chief Strategy Officer, $1B Regional Bank
“[They helped us see] how we stand with regard to specific products, locations and customer groups. It quantifies knowledge - we expect that over the next year we will increase profits and customer satisfaction at the same time.” EVP ($1B Regional Bank)


“I was skeptical—but no more. Within the first three hours, they’d helped us codify the wants, needs and issues of over a million customers through a series of easy-to-digest, hands-on exercises. Through these persona and their journeys, I know these customers better—and now everyone else can, too.” Senior VP Sales and Marketing $700M Software Company

Design Your CX Organization



Having worked with dozens of leading companies in the design and delivery of great customer experience, we’ve developed expertise in what it takes to successfully organize around the customer.
While the challenges of each company are unique, the organizational structure and capabilities needed to deliver great customer experience typically are not—in fact, you likely have several in place already.
If you’re interested in better understanding where your company stands in this context—and in learning how to leverage the capabilities you have to form the customer experience management organization you’d like—then let’s chat.

Customer Journey Mapping

A customer journey map is a powerful visual summary of the outside-in customer perspective. It allows you to walk in your customers’ shoes to see what they’re trying to accomplish, the barriers they encounter along the way, and specific opportunities for improvement.
Customer journey maps are tools that fit into the broader context of your customer experience management program. These end-to-end views of customer experience—across channels, silos, devices, and segments—map the success of the customer journey itself, highlighting points where customer expectations aren’t met.
While the process of customer journey mapping can be quite involved, it can potentially be a ‘quick win.’
For organizations interested in understanding the current state (‘as is’) journey, informed by either internal experts and/or customer feedback, the journey mapping process can be a highly informative way to jumpstart insights, drive action, and lead to immediate improvements.
Download your FREE Customer Journey Mapping Toolkit now and learn everything you need to better understand—and begin to implement—customer journey mapping at your company.

McorpCX | Insights brings immediate visibility to the business metrics that matter to you the most – how your customers feel about their experiences with your company, and how you can improve them.
By tracking your customers’ experience and loyalty through time along the lifecycle of their journey, you will see where to action, learn what’s most important, and prioritize what needs to be done.
Learn More...














Understand and measure your customer’s journey
Do you ever wonder what’s working well and what’s not in the eyes of your customers as they engage with your company?  
Wonder no more. McorpCX | Insights helps you better understand the journey your customers take, where it is strong and where it can improve to enable a more seamless and engaging experience.
With McorpCX | Insights you can quickly see, analyze, and explore your customer’s journey and make the decisions necessary to initiate change, hold internal teams accountable and drive continuous improvement.
Learn More...














Measure how your customers feel: Tracking emotion.
Emotions – both positive and negative – are at the heart of customer experience,  Which is why it’s so important to know which matter most to your customers, and how well your company is delivering against these expectations in the eyes of your customers.
This is why McorpCX | Insights puts hard numbers to the traditionally soft measures of customer feelings.  Actionable metrics will identify and prioritize which attributes matter most, track performance against your brand and your customers expectations, and show you where to focus to win your customers hearts and minds.
Learn More...














Visualize the performance of customer touchpoints.
Customers can choose lots of ways to interact with your business – mobile, online, over the phone, face-to-face, etc.
But do you know your customers channel preferences?  Or how well any of these channels - and the touchpoints in each - performs against customer expectations? We’ve found that understanding these metrics is critical to delivering the best, most seamless experience possible.
McorpCX | Insights surfaces these performance characteristics and many more – from your customer’s point of view – so you can easily identify and address what matters most to your customers.
Learn More...














Explore your customer’s experience, in-depth.
Customer experience is defined by what your customers think and feel, as much as by what they do.  To make their experience better – and improve customer loyalty, brand engagement, and customer service  –  need to understand how they feel about the quality of that experience. 
This is why we’ve become expert at putting hard metrics to the soft science of measuring customer perceptions. 
For McorpCX and our clients, this means not just measuring one number. it means assessing the right numbers to show you – by customer segment, journey, and touchpoint – exactly what to do to boost the business performsnce metrics most important to you.
Learn More...














Understand the loyalty of your customers.
Which customers are champions of your bard? Which feel trapped, or have one foot out the door? Knowing these answers – and how loyal each and all of your customers are –  lets you focus resources on those that are most valuable, and stem defections before they occur. 
Our exclusive loyalty model includes both satisfaction and NPS scoring, while expanding to provide a clearer picture of actual customer sentiment and actionable insights with both leading and lagging metrics.
In addition, our core loyalty metrics include NPS, purchase drivers, customer satisfaction, and more. No matter your approach to loyalty, we measure and give you the tools to improve it. 
Learn More...














Prioritize actions based on SWOT analysis.
Many companies fail to make progress against their customer experience aspirations because they don’t know where to begin; it’s challenging to move from insights to guiding decisions about the highest priority investments.
With McorpCX | Insights, you’ll get actionable analysis against the drivers of customer loyalty – identifying things you must absolutely get right just to remain competitive, things that are true “exciters” or differentiators, as well as areas where you may be over-investing and can cut back.
As a result, you can prioritize action based on quantitative research that reflects the voice of your customers and what is most important to them 
Learn More...














Segment-based customer understanding
Better understanding who and where your customers are is another critical element in deepening customer understanding.
Which is why McorpCX | Insights enables you to learn more about who your customers are, as well as how the experience your company delivers is perceived by different audiences across a broad range of geo-, demographic and segmentation measures.

About McorpCX | Persona
After nearly 15 years providing industry-leading customer experience practices based on personas, we've created a framework that facilitates creating, managing, and sharing information that describes your customers in ways everyone in the organization can understand and act on to deliver better, more engaging customer experiences.

Start Creating Personas Today!



Our Framework
Each of these building blocks help you tell the real story of your customers as you strive to deliver a superior customer experience.




Customer Goals
Frame what success looks like for your customers.





Customer Pain Points
Keep track of pain points you hear from you customers.





Customer Wants & Needs
Capture what motivates your customers.




Start Creating Personas Today!




Advanced Persona Management for Customer-Centric Companies.
McorpCX | Persona helps your team maximize the impact of your personas.




Create and share personas.
Having a library of personas that reflect the customers you serve, their wants, needs and expectations, helps drive deeper customer understanding and keeps the organization aligned on delivering against these expectations in a collaborative way.
Learn More...














Organize qualitative research and data.
Incorporate the information that you know about your customers to share with the organization.  Persona helps you organize your customer research with ultimate flexibility.  Add meaningful data to each persona based on what you today, and improve or subtract as you learn more about your customers, their wants, needs and expectations.
Learn More...














Prioritize insights and gather heat.
Persona enables your team to highlight the critical-path for the personas that represent the customers you serve, and gather heat from stakeholders.  When you can help your organization better understand what matters most to your customers, you can work together more effectively to deliver it.  When customer needs or demands change, you can quickly reprioritize so that everyone stays aligned in delivering against these new expectations.
Learn More...














Map personas to customer journeys.
Showing which personas traverse various customer journeys, and their experience in those journeys, helps your team stay aligned and aware.  From executives, to managers, to individual contributors, everyone will understand who matters most and how their work impacts the customer journey.
Learn More...














Create PDF's for printing and sharing.
While online collaboration on personas is great, sometimes there is a need to share printed output.  McorpCX | Persona incorporates the ability to easily produce beautiful 11x17 PDF of any persona for physical handouts, office posters, or slides.  You'll achieve new levels of efficiency and productivity without any design talent.
Learn More...

Greater customer empathy.
Boost empathy and awareness to eliminate blindspots.

Clearer design priorities.
