The article is called Valet Group  $3.77 million  Fundraising. Patrick Shawn Handrahan  Released Oct 13  form D and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/valet-group-3-77-million-fundraising-patrick-shawn-handrahan-released-oct-13-form-d/222164/.CaptchaSubmit
Valet Group Financing
Valet Group L.P., Limited Partnership just had published form D for $3.77 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Valet Group was able to finance itself with $3.77 million. That is 100.00% of the financing round. The total private financing amount was $3.77 million. The offering form was filed on 2015-10-13. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. 
 Valet Group is based in Florida. The filler’s business is not disclosed. The D form was filed by Patrick Shawn Handrahan President and Chief Executive Officer. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: C/O Ares Management, L.P., 2000 Avenue Of The Stars, 12Th Floor, Los Angeles, Ca, California, 90067. Patrick Shawn Handrahan is the related person in the form and it has address: 100 South Ashley Drive, Suite 700, Tampa, Fl, Florida, 33062. Link to Valet Group Filing: 000165501415000001.
Analysis of Valet Group Offering
On average, startups in the not disclosed sector, sell 67.77% of the total offering amount. Valet Group sold 100.00% of the offering. Could this mean that the trust in Valet Group is high? The average fundraising size for companies in all industries in our database is $3.05 million. The total amount raised is 23.44% bigger than the average for companies in the database. The minimum investment for this fundraising was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Valet Group Also
The Form D signed by Patrick Shawn Handrahan might help Valet Group L.P.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
