Since that time, Dorsey has served as CEO, chairman of the board, and executive chairman of Twitter. He also launched the successful online payment platform Square in 2010.Early LifeInventor of Twitter Jack Dorsey was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 19, 1976. Growing up in St. Louis, Dorsey became interested in computers and communications at an early age and began programming while still a student at Bishop DuBourg High School. He was fascinated by the technological challenge of coordinating taxi drivers, delivery vans and other fleets of vehicles that needed to remain in constant, real-time communication with one another. When he was 15, Dorsey wrote dispatch software that is still used by some taxicab companies today.Creation of TwitterAfter a brief stint at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Dorsey transferred to New York University. In the tradition of computer science entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, he dropped out of college before receiving his degree. Instead, Dorsey moved to Oakland, California, and in 2000 started a company offering his dispatch software through the Web. Shortly after starting his company, Dorsey came up with the idea for a site that would combine the broad reach of dispatch software with the ease of instant messaging. Dorsey approached a now-defunct Silicon Valley company called Odeo to pitch the concept. "He came to us with this idea: 'What if you could share your status with all your friends really easily, so they know what you're doing?'" said Biz Stone, a former Odeo executive. Dorsey, Stone and Odeo co-founder Evan Williams started a new company, called Obvious, which later evolved into Twitter. Within two weeks, Dorsey had built a simple site where users could instantly post short messages of 140 characters or less, known in Twitter parlance as "tweets." On March 21, 2006, Jack Dorsey posted the world's first tweet: "just setting up my twttr." Dorsey was named the company's chief executive officer. He removed his nose ring in an attempt to look the part of a mature Silicon Valley executive, though he kept his boyish, mop-like haircut and abstract, forearm-length tattoo whose shape represented, among other things, the human clavicle bone. Co-founder Evan Williams replaced Dorsey as Twitter's CEO in October 2008, with Dorsey staying on as company chairman.Twitter SuccessTwitter was initially derided by some as a tool for the shallow and self-centered to broadcast the minutiae of their lives to the universe. Late-night comedy host Conan O'Brien even featured a segment called "Twitter Tracker" that mocked users of the service. In its early days, the site also suffered from frequent service outages. But as celebrities and CEOs alike began tweeting, Twitter was no longer the brunt of so many jokes. Suddenly the head of the "microblogging" movement, Twitter became a powerful platform for U.S. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain in 2008, as a method for updating their supporters while on the campaign trail. Twitter vaulted to international prominence after the June 2009 presidential elections in Iran, when thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets to protest the claimed victory of incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. When the government blocked text messaging and satellite feeds of foreign news coverage, Iranian Twitter users flooded the site with live updates. A U.S. State Department official even emailed Dorsey to request that Twitter delay its scheduled maintenance so that protestors could keep tweeting. "It appears Twitter is playing an important role at a crucial time in Iran. Could you keep it going?" said a State Department spokesman, describing the call. Twitter complied.Beyond TwitterIn 2010, Twitter had more than 105 million users who together tweeted some 55 million times a day. Dorsey, however, had set his sights on other projects. He became an investor in the social networking company Foursquare and launched a new venture, Square, which allows people to receive credit card payments through a tiny device plugged in to their mobile phone or computer. Twitter may have already revolutionized the way that people communicate, but Dorsey isn't done yet. "In terms of technology, we're going to see a better and more immediate experience around the everyday things we do in life," Dorsey said.Billionaire BusinessmanIn November 2013, Dorsey saw his personal fortune grow tremendously thanks to Twitter's initial public offering. The company's stock had a starting share price of $26, but the price quickly rose to $45 during its first day of trading. Within hours, the value of Dorsey's approximately 23.4 million shares made him a billionaire. He already began discussing the possibility of an IPO for his other company, Square, in 2014.In 2015, Dorsey returned to Twitter. He first served as an interim CEO and then became its CEO. Not long after he officially took the company's top spot, he announced that the company would be cutting about 8% of its workforce. This move is "part of an overall plan to organize around the company's top product priorities and drive efficiencies throughout the company,” according a securities filing by Twitter reported in the Los Angeles Times.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

Twitter didn't add any new users last quarter, and the stock is diving




If you've been wondering who will replace Twitter's departing head of product, Kevin Weil, now you have your answer.
Nobody.
Or, put another way, Jack Dorsey.
Twitter revealed on Monday that the company will not appoint a direct successor to Weil, one of the five high-level executives who are leaving the company. Weil has overseen Twitter's product since October 2014, a period during which the company's user growth has basically ground to a halt.
Twitter said it was not hiring a new head of product, confirming a report first chronicled by The Wall Street Journal. And in a tweet on Sunday night, Dorsey noted that the consumer-product group will now fall under Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger, as will the engineering group.
The move will unite the product and engineering teams, which might help Twitter move faster. But Messinger has a lot of other stuff on his plate, and according to The WSJ, is known for his expertise in back-end engineering infrastructure, rather than consumer-product vision.
That would seem to leave Twitter at something of a disadvantage in exactly the part of its business that needs the most help.
Fortunately, Twitter already has a famous tech-product guru on staff.
Dorsey was one of the creators of Twitter. He also created Square, the digital-payments company that popularized the credit-card swipers used by every coffee shop and food truck.
One of the main rationales for Dorsey's return to Twitter as CEO was that he would be able to inject the bold product innovation that has been so sorely lacking at the company. And as a company founder, the thinking went, he would also have the moral authority to execute fundamental changes to the core product, whether that be abandoning the 140-character limit, the timeline's reverse-chronological order, or something bigger.
In other words, there's no need for a dedicated-product boss anymore, since that's basically Dorsey's strength. In fact, having a dedicated head-of-product boss might create more internal confusion and problems, given that Dorsey is really the company's product person.
Dorsey has his hands full, as he's also the CEO of Square. That doesn't leave him with as much time to focus on the product as someone doing that as their only job.
So Twitter is taking a gamble by putting all its product chips on the very thinly stretched Dorsey. But that die was already the cast when Twitter hired a CEO that had another full-time job.

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]

The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]

Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]
Main article: Twitter




Dorsey in 2008

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]

Jack Dorsey (born November 19, 1976) is an American computer programmer and internet entrepreneur widely known as a co-founder and CEO of Twitter, and as the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company.[7] In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8] For 2012, The Wall Street Journal gave him the "Innovator of the Year Award" for technology.[9]

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]




Biz Stone and Dorsey accepting a Crunchie award for best mobile startup


In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]
Main article: Twitter




Dorsey in 2008

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

Twitter’s chief executive responded to the sudden departure of four senior executives on Sunday by tweeting a detailed statement emphasising their contribution to the company as it moved from “near zero revenue to the over-$2bn run rate it is today”.
Jack Dorsey confirmed that senior vice-president of engineering Alex Roetter, vice-president of global media Katie Jacobs Stanton, HR vice-president Skip Schipper and senior vice-president of product Kevin Weil are all leaving the embattled social media firm. 
Attempting to reassure staff and investors about the stability of the company, Dorsey said chief operating officer Adam Bain would be taking on additional responsibilities, including “revenue-related product teams”, media and HR.

I’m forever grateful to @aroetter, @katies, @skipschipper & @kevinweil for everything they’ve given to Twitter. They are absolutely amazing!

January 25, 2016


Chief technology officer Adam Messinger will be heading up engineering, consumer product, design and research, user services and Twitter mobile development platform Fabric. Dorsey said the two of them would be partnering “day and night” to coordinate the company’s development.
Twitter is under increasing pressure from shareholders to increase revenues and become more aggressive against competitors including Facebook and younger rivals such as Snapchat.

Dorsey said he had wanted to talk to Twitter staff about the changes later in the week, but now needed to set the record straight after “inaccurate press rumours”. He did not explain which reports were inaccurate, although news of the departures was first reported by Re/code earlier in the day. 
“I’m sad to announce that Alex Roetter, Skip Schipper, Katie Stanton and Kevin Weil have chosen to leave the company. Alex and Kevin, both here over five years, scaled the ads product and engineering teams,” he said. “[They] have run all of product and engineering together for the last 18 months, helping to drive an increased pace of execution. 
“Katie, also here over five years, has grown a global team that brings the world’s best, most engaging, and most powerful content onto our services.”
Schipper, he said, “played a key role scaling our HR functions … globally”. All four are said to be planning time off.
Twitter is planning to announce two new board members, a new chief marketing officer and a head of PR, according to Re/code and the New York Times.

January 24, 2016


Long-time Twitter investor Chris Sacca, who has also been outspoken in his criticism of the company, said Dorsey would be able to appoint strong talent, but that Twitter would need to ensure new board members increased the diversity of the board.

Jack Dorsey Takes Over Product Again At Twitter As Executive Chairman

Jack Dorsey is back at Twitter in a big way.  He just tweeted that he is now taking on the lead product role at Twitter, the company he co-founded and where he’s remained as chairman.  To reflect his new operating role, his title will now be executive chairman.  Dorsey will remain CEO of Square.
News that Dorsey was negotiating with Twitter for an expanded role came out last week.  There was some speculation that he might even take the CEO spot, but it is very difficult to be the CEO of two technology companies at the same time and Dorsey is “200%” committed to Square.  All you have to do is watch this video to see how much he cares about building great products.  And now he will be doing that at both Twitter and Square, while leaving the business side of Twitter to CEO Dick Costolo.
Dorsey stepped down from the CEO spot at Twitter in 2008, when he was replaced by Evan Williams.  Williams subsequently handed over the CEO title to Dick Costolo, ostensibly so that he could focus on the product.  But Williams supposedly hasn’t been around that much.  When Williams stepped down, that opened the door for Dorsey to expand his role (there was some bad blood between the two), which is what’s happening now.
Twitter is now five years old.  Dorsey recently put out some nostalgic Tweets about how the product got started.  Today, Twitter is a different beast with more than 200 million users and an array of products (Web, mobile, tablets) that must be best-of-breed.  Twitter began much more simply by providing the underlying service and encouraging other developers to build clients and features.  The relationship with outside developers is now strained.  Will Dorsey work to repair and reinvigorate those ties or focus more on making Twitter’s own products the only ones people need?


Today I'm thrilled to get back to work at @Twitter leading product as Executive Chairman. And yes: leading @Square forevermore as CEO. #200%
— Jack (@jack) March 28, 2011

Jack Dorsey (born November 19, 1976) is an American computer programmer and internet entrepreneur widely known as a co-founder and CEO of Twitter, and as the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company.[7] In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8] For 2012, The Wall Street Journal gave him the "Innovator of the Year Award" for technology.[9]

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]




Biz Stone and Dorsey accepting a Crunchie award for best mobile startup


In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]
Main article: Twitter

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

SAN FRANCISCO — Shortly after Twitter’s board of directors began its search for a new chief executive in June, it said it would only accept someone willing to commit to the job full time. It was a not-so-subtle message to Twitter’s co-founder and interim boss, Jack Dorsey, that he would have to give up his job running Square, a mobile payments start-up, if he wanted to run Twitter on a permanent basis.On Monday, the eight-member board reversed itself, announcing that it had decided to allow Mr. Dorsey, its chairman, to head both companies after all. The decision came despite lingering reservations by some directors who felt that Twitter needed a full-time leader, according to people familiar with the board’s deliberations.Mr. Dorsey, who never seriously contemplated leaving Square, overcame those objections in part by running Twitter — quite adeptly, by most accounts — for the last three months.“We had a chance to see what Jack did now,” Peter Currie, who led the board’s search committee, said in an interview. “He demonstrated success in the role.” Continue reading the main story

Board members said Mr. Dorsey, 38, accelerated the pace of product improvements started last year by his predecessor, Dick Costolo, and communicated frequently and openly with employees. He also demonstrated a willingness to delegate many of his duties to his senior team, including Adam Bain, Twitter’s president of global revenue and partnerships, who was promoted to chief operating officer.

“I am honored by the trust the board has put in me to continue to run the company,” Mr. Dorsey said during a conference call on Monday with Twitter investors. He said he would focus on three things: disciplined execution, simplifying the service and communicating Twitter’s value to users.This is Mr. Dorsey’s second go-round as Twitter’s chief executive.Evan Williams, a board member and co-founder of Twitter who was instrumental in firing him in 2008, noted that the board considered many candidates before settling on Mr. Dorsey.

“I honestly didn’t think we’d land on Jack when we started unless he could step away from Square,” Mr. Williams wrote in a post on Medium, the social media site he now runs. “But ultimately, we decided it was worth it.”In the end, Mr. Dorsey made a compelling case that he had matured and grown as a leader and that only a founder would have the moral authority to truly shake up a company that has been struggling to attract new users and compete for advertising dollars.“He’s a bit of a Pied Piper,” Mr. Currie said.The decision of Mr. Bain, who was also a candidate for the top job, to stay on as Mr. Dorsey’s deputy was critical in helping to persuade the board that Mr. Dorsey could “load balance” as a part-timer, Mr. Currie said.Mr. Bain, 41, is known for his deft touch with people and has long charmed advertisers, which are the principal source of the company’s revenue. As chief operating officer, Mr. Bain will continue to focus on courting that crucial constituency, allowing Mr. Dorsey to focus on improving the core product and on his responsibilities at Square, which is preparing for a possible initial public offering of stock.“Having Jack the product guy and Adam the advertising guy sitting next to each other makes a lot of sense,” said Debra Aho Williamson, the principal social media analyst at eMarketer, a research firm. “You need both.”


            About Jack Dorsey        













        Nov. 19, 1976  00:00 AM
      

        Born and raised in St. Louis, Mo., Jack Dorsey shows an interest in computers and communications early in life. At 15, he writes software for taxi dispatchers. He later would say that the idea for Twitter “started with me working in dispatch since I was 15 years old, where taxi cabs or firetrucks would broadcast where they were and what they were doing.”
      



        Jan.  1, 2000  00:00 AM
      

        Mr. Dorsey studies computer science at the University of Missouri, Rolla (now the Missouri University of Science and Technology), but heads to New York in the mid-1990s. He leaves New York University just shy of receiving a diploma and moves to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2000.
      




        Jan.  1, 2005  00:00 AM
      

        Sitting in a San Francisco coffee shop, Mr. Dorsey notices Evan Williams, a known entity in the city's tech scene. Mr. Williams had sold his company, Blogger, to Google and was working on a podcast start-up, Odeo. Mr. Dorsey is inspired to send his résumé to Mr. Williams, who hires him as a freelance engineer.
      



        Mar. 21, 2006  00:00 AM
      

        Mr. Dorsey, who had been thinking of quitting the tech world to become a fashion designer, instead begins to develop an idea for a micromessaging service, and gets the backing of Mr. Williams. On March 21, 2006, Mr. Dorsey sends out the first tweet, and shortly afterward is named chief executive of the new company, Twitter.
      



        Oct. 15, 2008  00:00 AM
      

        Even as he shows himself to be a product visionary, privately Mr. Dorsey becomes known as a polarizing figure, criticized for his leadership style and outside pursuits. After continued management conflicts with Mr. Williams, Mr. Dorsey is fired as chief executive.
      



        Jan.  1, 2009  00:00 AM
      

        After briefly flirting with joining Facebook, Mr. Dorsey becomes a co-founder of Square, a credit-card processing company aimed at small businesses, with James McKelvey.  Mr. Dorsey takes on the role of chief executive.
      



        Mar. 28, 2011  00:00 AM
      

         Dick Costolo brings Mr. Dorsey back to Twitter as executive chairman, overseeing the company's products, after Mr. Dorsey helped engineer a 2010 boardroom coup in which Mr. Williams was removed as chief and replaced by Mr. Costolo. After friction with Twitter employees, Mr. Dorsey is gradually eased out of the product role, though Mr. Costolo continues to seek his advice during weekly meals.
      



        Jul.  1, 2015  00:00 AM
      

        Amid deepening turmoil at the company, Mr. Dorsey returns to Twitter as interim chief executive, taking over from Mr. Costolo. 
      



        Oct.  5, 2015  00:00 AM
      

        Twitter names Mr. Dorsey chief executive and announces that he will also remain chief executive and chairman of Square, which is preparing for an initial public offering.
      






The pair will face top advertisers and agencies together for the first time in New York on Thursday when they make a presentation about the company’s video advertising products and discuss the marketing potential of a new feature, code-named Project Lightning, that shows top tweets by subject.Chris Williams, president of Magna Global, an ad agency that works with big brands like Chrysler and Coca-Cola, said Twitter had failed to keep up with rivals like Facebook and Google. And despite Mr. Bain’s talents, the ad team thinned out quickly below him, Mr. Williams said.“You have to move forward,” Mr. Williams said. “You have to innovate, and you have to do it quickly.” He added, “I’ve got Facebook and Google knocking at my door five times a week.”

Ross Levinsohn, a media investor and former tech executive who hired Mr. Bain and worked with him for seven years at Fox’s online and entertainment properties, said Mr. Bain would be a true partner to Mr. Dorsey.

“He’s incredibly talented on the management side and the people side,” Mr. Levinsohn said, noting that Mr. Bain rebuilt FoxSports.com and other products and negotiated acquisitions in addition to creating new streams of revenue.“He’s got a really broad skill set, which should make him a great C.O.O.,” Mr. Levinsohn said. “That will allow Jack to do what he does best: the product vision.”Mr. Dorsey has pushed a faster pace of product improvement while serving as interim chief since Mr. Costolo, the company’s chief executive for about five years, stepped down on July 1.

Mr. Costolo left Twitter’s board of directors last week, the company announced, and Twitter is in the process of finding a new, outside candidate for the role of board chairman. Previously, Mr. Dorsey served as Twitter’s chairman.Twitter has become a household name, with political leaders and celebrities around the world using the network to broadcast text messages and images to millions of followers.But the company has struggled to convey to ordinary people why they should regularly use the service, which carries roughly half a billion messages a day.Twitter had an average of 316 million monthly users in the second quarter, a number that has been largely flat for some time. Despite some changes to make the service easier for newcomers to understand, Twitter still trails other social networks like Facebook and Instagram and major messaging platforms like WhatsApp in popularity.It has also been slow to capitalize on the public’s enormous demand for video, although its new Periscope app has established a strong position in streaming live events.

The company has tried to attract casual visitors by giving them a taste of the “best of Twitter” on its home page before requiring that they create an account, and by setting up “instant timelines” of tweets based on who is on a person’s cellphone contact list. Similarly, it has begun exploring the possibility of selling ads that would be shown to more casual visitors.So far, it is too early for those nascent efforts to show results.Twitter’s challenges have unnerved investors, who were counting on it to match the rapid growth of its early days. In recent weeks, the company’s shares have traded below the $26 price at which they first sold nearly two years ago.On Monday, after news of Mr. Dorsey’s appointment, the stock soared 7 percent to close at $28.15.“Now that Twitter’s C.E.O. drama is out of the way, the company can get back to doing its job: Building products people want to use,” Nate Elliott, a social media analyst for Forrester Research, wrote in an email. “Not every new idea launched will succeed, but if it launches enough new features, some will surely find a wider audience. And a wider audience is exactly what Twitter needs.”

 Correction: October 5, 2015  
        Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated a role that Adam Bain will take on. He will be chief operating officer, not president and chief operating officer. Also because of an editing error, the earlier version described incorrectly the board’s actions related to the company’s leadership. The board is looking for a chairman; it has not named Evan Williams, a founder, to the post.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

Jack Dorsey Is Losing Control of Twitter
















































  












Jack Dorsey Is Losing Control of Twitter



Photographer: Yana Paskova/Bloomberg


A year after his return as CEO, live-streaming and new products haven’t revived growth.
By Sarah Frier | October 5, 2016




A few days before Twitter’s Sept. 8 board meeting, as the company’s finance team readied a presentation, it received conflicting directions on a crucial question. Should their slides reflect Twitter’s prospects as an independent company or delve into the benefits of getting acquired?
Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive officer, argued that the 10-year-old company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video, people familiar with the discussions said. Ev Williams, a former CEO who has a history of clashing with Dorsey, was in favor of exploring a sale. Other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option. The board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer, which led it to hire Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to evaluate possible bids.




After pitching the San Francisco-based social network, the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include Disney and Salesforce, with Google also weighing a potential bid. This week, the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process is private. Formal bids could come within a couple of weeks–or not at all.
Though its fate is in flux, one thing is clear: A year after he officially took back the reins as CEO, Jack Dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create. On the board, he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of Twitter as an independent company. Within his management team, he’s largely delegated command of Twitter’s strategy to chief financial officer Anthony Noto. And among advertisers, Twitter’s fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers, which Dorsey’s product changes have failed to significantly boost, and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service.

“The lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that Jack’s initiatives thus far haven’t really been effective,” said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. “If this whole ‘live’ idea doesn’t work, then what is it that gets Twitter to grow?”
Twitter spokeswoman Kristin Binns declined to comment on the board’s discussions about a potential sale process. Asked to provide perspective on Dorsey’s progress, Binns said in an e-mail that the CEO has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company. The company has been rolling out products faster than ever, she noted, and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline, such as showing people the most relevant tweets first. She also cited the company’s advancements and partnerships in live video streaming, including deals to broadcast NFL games and presidential debates.


His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic.


As Twitter’s first CEO, Dorsey was initially known as a detail-obsessed micromanager. He was ousted in 2008, then brought back to Twitter–which was having trouble attracting new users–to apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring.
But Dorsey hasn’t seemed interested in being the sole authority on Twitter’s future, according to insiders. While he was away from Twitter, he built a credit-card reader company, Square Inc., and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions. His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive, these people said. He’ll ask open-ended questions to spark debate, like, “Are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our 140-character tweet limit? What would a different solution look like?“ 
The discussions eventually lead to solutions, like Twitter’s move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweet’s character total. But the process takes time. And that passive, contemplative style created a void in management that Noto has stepped in to fill, people said.
“Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “He’s been unusually active as a CFO.”

Earlier this year, Noto told Twitter’s other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night National Football League games. He wasn’t expecting to win, but he wanted to try, according to people familiar with the conversations. 
Noto, who is a former CFO of the NFL, did win–for the bargain price of $10 million, lower than what others were willing to pay. That kicked off a string of other deals in sports, politics and entertainment, centered on making Twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free. The first NFL game drew 2.3 million users, and the next one got 2.4 million, hinting at the potential for a growing audience, according to the company.
It’s not that Dorsey has been uninvolved. On the contrary, his employees say he answers e-mails so quickly that it’s difficult to imagine how he has the time, given that he’s also still CEO of Square. During his first month at Twitter, he cut 8 percent of the workforce. He recruited new board members like Debra Lee, the CEO of BET, and Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsico, to add executive experience. He’s helped the strategy by providing a long-term perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it: live.
But if Dorsey is the introverted deep thinker, Noto is the doer. He’s the high-energy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied Twitter’s employees around a future of live video streaming, boosted by licensing of premium content. (Twitter has partnered with Bloomberg LP to stream some Bloomberg TV shows, as well as the presidential debates.) It’s unusual for a company’s CFO to be leading its product vision, and even rarer at a technology company.
Twitter’s engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use, cycling through six heads of product in six years. Noto’s deal-making provided them with a unique solution: to make video an entry point to the Twitter experience. Twitter recently released streaming applications for Apple TV, Xbox and Amazon Fire TV, letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets, and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to follow–previously a cumbersome prerequisite of using Twitter.
Twitter hired Noto in 2014 with more than $60 million in stock options, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs, where he helped Twitter go public. It’s unclear whether Noto supports a Twitter sale. But he did recently retain Goldman to look at other options, like selling off assets besides the core business, according to people familiar. Noto’s presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors, with many figuring that if it came time to sell, he would know how to get it done.

Even as the company gains ground in streaming, Dorsey is being forced to reconsider Twitter’s future in part because its lack of user growth. U.S. average monthly users have hovered around 66 million for six quarters. Revenue, which more than doubled in 2014, is projected to rise just 15 percent this year, and to slow further next year.
Advertisers see potential in the company’s live video strategy, but they’re also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebook’s Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitter’s 2013 initial public offering, those services weren’t close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.
“Twitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down,” said James Douglas, who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for Society, an agency within IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Coca-Cola and Red Bull. “It’s kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with Twitter that wasn’t good, or have the perception that Twitter’s audience is declining. Everyone has questions for them,” Douglas said.
Tom Buontempo, the president of Attention, the social arm of ad firm KBS, said he’s seen the trend worsen in recent months. It’s all a matter of where people are spending their time, he said. “I’m starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on Twitter at all.” Attention’s clients include BMW, Mattel and Lincoln Financial, though Buontempo wouldn’t say who is pulling back.
When Twitter’s CEO search committee was looking to replace Dick Costolo in 2015, they made calls to major investors, asking for input and floating Dorsey’s name as a contender. Some investors expressed their skepticism, given that Dorsey was already a large influence on Costolo, and could already impact the company’s direction through his executive chairman role.


Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors haven't been willing to wait.


Still, one year ago this week, Twitter’s board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back Dorsey permanently. Dorsey would “help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company,” Peter Currie, who helped lead the search and has since left the board, said at the time. “The board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy, vision and alignment around goals coming from the Twitter teams these last few months, and there is much more the world hasn’t seen just yet.”
Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors haven’t been willing to wait.
Twitter’s stock had dropped about 20 percent this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale. Even one of its largest and earliest investors, Chris Sacca, a vocal critic of Twitter’s strategy under Costolo and proponent of bringing back Dorsey, has sold a large part of his stake, he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.
Brad Slingerlend, who manages the global technology fund for Janus Capital Group, holds Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple–but sold Twitter after Dorsey took over. Social networking, he said, is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth. If the network’s momentum starts to ebb, it’s difficult to recover.
The best-case scenario, Slingerlend said, would be an acquisition by Disney. As Twitter becomes more of a media company, the two make for a good fit, he said. And Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, has experience bringing a brand back to life.
“Jack is a good entrepreneur,” Slingerlend said. “But Twitter needs a turnaround CEO, and that’s a completely different job.”

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

How Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Plans to Fix the Company

By Erin Griffith


					Illustration by Eddie Guy for Fortune				

					March 8, 2016, 6:30 AM EDT				

How the media-juggernaut-turned-train-wreck is getting back on track after a rough two years.
In late January the Tweeps needed a kumbaya moment, and Jack Dorsey knew exactly how to give it to them. Donning a ball cap, white T-shirt, and zippered neon-orange high-tops, Twitter’s co-founder-turned-CEO-turned-pariah-turned-executive-chairman-turned-interim-CEO-turned-permanent-CEO stepped onto a small stage at the weekly all-hands meeting in Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters. The week had been hard, he admitted to a standing-room-only crowd of over 1,000 employees. But he had a plan to fix everything.
The previous Sunday, Jan. 24, news had leaked that four of Twitter’s top executives were leaving, forcing Dorsey to tweet a terse, defensive response. From the outside, it looked as if the social media service was bleeding talent and fumbling to react. In reality, the shake-up was part of Dorsey’s plan, a plan that he now explained in more detail to his co-workers. The departures, he said, were all part of Twitter’s turning a page.
The meeting quickly became a sort of corporate pep rally. Rank-and-file engineers and salespeople stepped up to the mike, effusively telling one another why they work at Twitter. (“Because this product saved my life” and “Because one tweet can change the world” and “Because I’ve never believed in a mission more.”) Anthony Noto, Twitter’s ex-banker CFO, declared, “It’s just us!” echoing earlier comments—“No one is coming to save us”—from a staff-wide memo. That may sound like an odd rallying cry, but employees latched onto the underdog message.
There was cheering. There was tweeting (#OneTeam, #LoveWhereYouWork, #ItsJustUs). “It was a moment of Jack at his best,” says senior director of corporate development and strategy Jessica Verrilli, whom Dorsey recently lured back to the company just a few months after she had left. “It was electrifying.”

A jolt of electricity is exactly what Twitter needs. With stalled user growth, a stock trading at 30% below its IPO level, and a revolving door of executives, the past two years have been among the worst in Twitter’s history. And all the company’s missteps seemed to play out in public—especially on Twitter itself, where power users of the service pounced on every shortcoming and continually predicted its demise. “They’ve run out of eyes to be black,” says Chris Sacca, an early investor who still holds a substantial stake. “This is a company that has taken every punch possible and is still standing.” (Sacca believes Twitter’s worst days are behind it.)

Most vexing is the fact that Twitter, which turns 10 years old on March 21, is still grappling with the existential question that’s plagued its existence throughout: What is Twitter?
just setting up my twttr— Jack Dorsey (@jack) March 21, 2006
Five years ago Dorsey didn’t think the company needed an answer. “It’s different things to different people at different times,” he said at a conference. The ambiguity has taken its toll, leading to sluggish innovation, strategy whiplash, and internal dysfunction, all of which intensified—along with the scrutiny—after Twitter went public in November 2013. Worst of all: In a tech culture where constant evolution and perfection of “product” is the gold standard, Twitter’s product development had become a chaotic, crazy-balloons catastrophe, moving in every direction but forward.
In October, a few months after former chief Dick Costolo resigned, Dorsey officially became Twitter’s CEO. He’s simultaneously running Square, the payments company he founded and took public last year. In February he finally answered that pesky existential question: According to Dorsey, “Twitter is live: live commentary, live connections, live conversations.” Already Dorsey is encouraging bold changes to Twitter’s most iconic features, which COO Adam Bain says is critical to Twitter’s future success. “Part of why I knew it could only be Jack was because the product moves we knew we needed to make could only be done by the founder and the inventor of the product,” he says.
Twitter did not make Dorsey available for an interview. But conversations with advertisers, investors, and 15 current and former employees reveal confidence in him. Most of them—even the bitter ones—said some version of, “If anyone can do it, it’s Jack.”
The question is whether anyone can do it. Twitter’s product has insinuated itself into the fabric of international discussion, and the company earned $2.2 billion in revenue in 2015 (with a net loss of $521 million). But because Twitter failed to take that success to the next level, it hasn’t met the lofty expectations the media, tech, and financial worlds had for it, and that it had for itself.
Twitter has 320 million monthly active users—impressive, but well short of the billion-user milestone that separates a digital-media superpower from an also-ran. Alphabet owns seven billion-user products. Facebook has two. Three years ago, at its IPO, most observers thought Twitter could get to the billion-user mark too. But since then the company’s product has stagnated, while competitors—Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat—have continually made their services better and more essential to their users.

Incredible, singular events happen on Twitter, from Kanye West’s wild rants to Donald Trump’s latest bullying. But the best of Twitter gets embedded around the web, analyzed on TV, and even quoted in stodgy old newspapers. So despite Twitter’s 95% brand awareness, many regular people—those who aren’t influencers in media, finance, activism, sports, politics, or pop culture—have decided they don’t need the app. Investors, in turn, have decided Twitter is worth a mere $12.5 billion—a far cry from Alphabet’s $494 billion market capitalization and Facebook’s $308 billion.

Twitter’s management, led by the would-be superman Dorsey, isn’t giving up. But this could be the company’s last chance to get it right.



In 2011, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s recently promoted CEO, decided that Twitter should make $20 million that year from a product focusing on live events, like concerts and big football games. There was just one problem: Not only did the events product not exist, but the vision of what it might look like didn’t exist. All Twitter had was a catchy concept and a revenue target. Twitter’s product managers had to scramble to create something advertisers might pay $20 million for rather than build something Twitter’s users might want. It was revenue first, product second, epitomizing everything that was wrong with Twitter’s strategy, according to employees familiar with the project. And to no one’s surprise, the $20 million didn’t materialize that year, because no “events product” shipped.
It’s hard to overstate how much companies like Twitter live and die by their products—the apps and websites they build and their constant improvements to those offerings. It’s critical, according to Silicon Valley wisdom, that the products have a clearly defined “vision.” Even more critically, products must emphasize user experience over revenue. If a company gets too greedy and ignores what users want, that company is dead. Users are a fickle bunch. Just ask Myspace.

Twitter’s culture, leftover from playing catch-up to its own early runaway growth, has been more reactive than visionary. Its style has been to build things “the crafty, hack-y way,” as a former executive puts it. That adds to Twitter’s charm, but it doesn’t motivate product managers to dream up ambitious long-term projects. Many of Twitter’s most innovative features, including the hashtag, @reply, and retweet, were actually invented by users. “We always had a long list of stuff that we were slogging through, and we would only look quarter ahead to quarter ahead to quarter ahead,” says COO Bain, a 5½-year veteran of Twitter’s sales side.
As CEO, Costolo had strengths, although being a “product visionary” wasn’t one of them. He was well-versed in teaching managers how to manage. And he pulled off something Twitter’s previous two CEOs, including Dorsey, had not: bringing an air of relative stability to the freewheeling, Fail Whaling startup. He whipped Twitter into a revenue-generating business, taking it public in 2013 with a 73% first-day stock pop that drove its valuation to $22 billion. He also took a bold stab at the “What is Twitter?” question in the company’s public offering document with four simple words: public, real-time, conversational, and distributed.
But even during the successful IPO, investor concerns about slowing user growth lurked beneath the surface. Eager to show he could jump-start growth, Costolo put his No. 2, COO Ali Rowghani, in charge of Twitter’s product division. A glowing Wall Street Journal profile dubbed Rowghani “Twitter’s Mr. Fix-It.”

Rowghani found a disorganized, overstaffed product and engineering team that couldn’t agree on anything. Every team seemed to overlap with every other team, because no matter the name (“Growth” or “Timeline,” say) they were all essentially working on the same thing: the tweet. A rule that any team could test a new feature on 1% of Twitter’s users was meant to spur creativity, but soon Twitter was running more than 100 tests at once with little coordination. “It quickly got to the point where it was like throwing darts on a board rather than testing a hypothesis,” a former executive says.
What’s more, Twitter continued to grapple with its identity. Within six months of its IPO, the company’s biggest product initiatives no longer matched Costolo’s “public, real-time, conversational, and distributed” description. A feature called “While you were away” showed users old tweets they might have missed—the opposite of real-time. Updates to “direct messages,” Twitter’s one-on-one messaging service, were by definition not public. Meanwhile Instagram and Snapchat were grabbing attention with their own public, conversational, and occasionally real-time products, taking market share that should have been Twitter’s.
By May 2014, Twitter’s stock price had been slashed by more than half from its January high, and Costolo was under pressure. He took control of product development back from Rowghani, prompting his COO to resign on June 12, 2014. Looking back, many insiders point to that day, exactly a year before Costolo stepped down as CEO, as the clearest sign Costolo was doomed. “That was the moment everyone realized Dick was running scared, looking over his shoulder,” a former executive says. (Costolo did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

High turnover and regime changes plagued Twitter through the next 12 months. The company lost two vice presidents of engineering, a product head, a media head, a director of product, and a senior director of engineering (see timeline above). The lack of continuity only intensified the short-term thinking among Twitter’s product builders. Any progress on new features “would be blown up every six months” by another reorganization, says a former executive.
The dysfunction reached an apex in May 2015 when Sacca, the early investor, published a series of blog posts longer than the U.S. Constitution outlining the company’s shortcomings. Investor cries for Costolo’s head intensified, not helped by Twitter’s June 3 shareholder meeting, where he reiterated his latest vision: “to connect everyone to their world.” (AT&T once used a similar mission statement.)
A week later Costolo stepped down. It was his idea, he insisted in interviews. Things at Twitter were just fine. In a statement that bewildered anyone who had been following along, Costolo said, “We have great leaders who work well together and a clear strategy.” Since then at least 16 high-level managers and executives have left, and the company’s tactics have completely changed.



Jack Dorsey has said Twitter should be “the most powerful microphone in the world.” Lately it’s been a powerful microphone for people to complain about Twitter. When, in January, Twitter changed its star-shaped “favorite” button into a heart, users loudly protested. (Even ex-Tweep Vivian Schiller tweeted, “I don’t get the point of this.”)
@aweiss i know i know. i'm just grumpy because I don't get the point of this.— Vivian Schiller (@vivian) November 03, 2015
When the Twittersphere learned that the service would expand its iconic 140-character count, the vitriol was so strong that Dorsey had to tweet a clarification. On news that Twitter would use a Facebook-like algorithm to sort its fast-moving stream, the Internet boiled over in rage, elevating the hashtag #RIPTwitter to a trending topic.






Passionate users will always react passionately to big changes. But the real takeaway, Twitter executives will tell you, is the speed at which Twitter is introducing these changes. In the past Twitter’s product managers would debate for ages over barely noticeable tweaks. But in recent weeks, “we’re shipping, we’re shipping, we’re shipping,” says Verrilli, the corporate development director. “That is the energy and the momentum that characterizes the company right now.” (The other takeaway is that the changes appear to be working: Twitter says the heart button got 6% more use in its first week than the star button averaged since it was invented.)
Before it could ship, ship, ship, Twitter had to clean house. In October, Dorsey laid off 8% of its 4,200-person staff. “Some of the people that got laid off were amazing,” says a former product manager, “but you can’t have a bunch of people doing the same job.” Then Dorsey had to fix Twitter’s broken product process. He borrowed a strategy from Apple by appointing a “DRI” (directly responsible individual) in charge of decisions for each product. He also insisted that designers be included earlier in the development process. Dorsey killed features that he believes focus on boosting short-term metrics without adding much to the overall Twitter experience, like a “follow” button that appeared on individual tweets. His message to employees is “think bolder.” At a January executive retreat, he handed out copies of the book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, which includes motivational, if vague, lines like “Becoming is better than being.” The right mind-set, according to Mindset, is a “growth mindset.”

And in February, Dorsey finally delivered his “Twitter is live” mission statement. “Hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the fastest way to understand the power of Twitter,” he wrote in a letter to investors. And okay, sure! People tweet more when there is breaking news or when they’re watching a live event like the Super Bowl. Periscope, the fast-growing video app Twitter acquired last year, is primarily live.
Having reorganized and declared a mind-set, a vision, and a set of priorities, Dorsey is now in recruiting mode. Hiring coups so far include former Google chief business officer Omid Kordestani as executive chairman, former American Express chief marketing officer Leslie Berland to run marketing, and former Apple PR executive Natalie Kerris to head communications. There’s also the effusive rehire Verrilli, who says, “If you are here, you’re here because you believe in this place and you’re trying to create something great.”

Indeed, staring at one of the many neon-blue signs at Twitter’s offices that command you to #lovewhereyouwork when you actually #hateit would be miserable. Disgruntled employees have no shortage of well-funded startups to jump to, and scores have done just that, landing predominately at Uber, Lyft, and Slack. (Some Twitter employees are calling Slack, a business messaging software startup, “the New Old Twitter.”) There’s even a Slack chatroom where hundreds of Twitter alumni at different companies share articles and gossip about their former employer—it’s called Flown the Coop. Those who stayed got a giant thank-you gift from Dorsey in October when he announced plans to give a third of his Twitter stock (worth $122 million at press time) to the employee equity pool.

Still Breaking the Internet

Business woes aside, Twitter is where the biggest names in politics, media, and the arts break news and change the zeitgeist. Here are three of Fortune’s favorite world-changing tweets from the past year …
Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.— President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015
"And you can want who you want... Boys and boys and girls and girls."

#lovewins #FINALLY— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 26, 2015

…and one from a famous guy begging for money.
Mark Zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West ideas— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016
For more tweets that made big news, read “12 Tweets That Changed the World.”
Through the drama, Twitter’s advertising business, run by the well-respected COO Bain, has remained a bright spot, and revenue grew 58% last year. Despite Facebook’s best attempts to court so-called influencers, Twitter is still the go-to place for politicians, business leaders, athletes, and Kanye West to make important announcements. When West publicly asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to give him $1 billion, did he make the request on Facebook? Nope—he tweeted it. (See above.) Tony Effik, vice president of media and connections at ad agency R/GA, says buying ads on Twitter works great for reaching prominent professionals and leaders who drive public debates. The scale may not be there, he says, but the influence is.
Twitter isn’t profitable, but it has a $3.5 billion pile of cash. And though an unusually high percentage of its shares are held by short-sellers, many analysts believe that the company has hit the bottom—it can only go up from here. Just two out of 43 analysts covering Twitter have a sell rating on the stock. “Now it’s all about execution,” says Bob Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. “It’s more of a ‘show me’ story now.”
In its decade of existence Twitter has survived enough drama and dysfunction to kill 100 startups of its size—it has taken every punch possible, as Sacca says, and is still standing. If Dorsey can transform “crafty, hack-y” Twitter into a focused, product-execution machine, the missteps of the past few years should give way to stability and growth. Twitter has a solid brand, a solid business, and an influence that’s impossible to quantify. That may have to be enough for now—superpower status is out of reach.

Jack Dorsey Quotes

American
-
Businessman

Born: November 19, 1976










































   Loading...






My goal is to simplify complexity. I just want to build stuff that really simplifies our base human interaction.
Jack Dorsey


Goal,
Want,
Build



















The idea of Twitter started with me working in dispatch since I was 15 years old, where taxi cabs or firetrucks would broadcast where they were and what they were doing.
Jack Dorsey


Working,
Me,
Doing
























The Web provides a very easy way to immediately grasp what's going on. It really offers the transparency, so you can see, especially with the search engine, how people are using Twitter at one glance. The phone doesn't allow for that.
Jack Dorsey


People,
You,
See



















I'm less interested in how people are following each other and more interested in how they are following topics and tweets themselves. People are following more key words and concepts and more ideas and acting on those rather than individuals or organizations.
Jack Dorsey


Words,
Acting,
Ideas



















I think Twitter is the future of communications and Square will be the payment network.
Jack Dorsey


Future,
Think,
Will



















When people come to Twitter and they want to express something in the world, the technology fades away. It's them writing a simple message and them knowing that people are going to see it.
Jack Dorsey


Technology,
Writing,
Simple



















I love cities, and I love city governments in particular. But in politics it would have taken me 8 years from implementing a policy before I would get to see the feedback. With programming I could model the same policies and see the impact immediately. Technology is a far more efficient way to test.
Jack Dorsey


Love,
Technology,
Politics



















What's interesting about Twitter and the influencers that someone follows - like, say, Shaquille O'Neal - is that they see someone who is using the exact same tools that they have access to, and I think that inspires this hope to be able to really engage with someone like him.
Jack Dorsey


Hope,
Tools,
Think



















IM is interesting because you look at your buddy list and, at a glance, see what your friends are listening to, what they're working on, what they're doing. The problem was that you were bound to the computer keyboard.
Jack Dorsey


Friends,
Listening,
Problem
























It's a matter of invitations versus context. Twitter is really good at providing context, like, I'm having coffee at Third Rail Coffee.' Foursquare is about invitations to places. In this respect Foursquare has started to replace Yelp for me.
Jack Dorsey


Respect,
Good,
Coffee



















I fell in love with flora of all types, especially ferns. Loved the sparse structure and repetition of shape - almost fractal.
Jack Dorsey


Love,
Loved,
Repetition



















Anything you're interested in the world - whether it be Charlie Rose or JetBlue or a public figure or your local coffee shop - they're on Twitter and broadcasting what is interesting to them.
Jack Dorsey


Coffee,
Rose,
World



















The interesting products out on the Internet today are not building new technologies. They're combining technologies. Instagram, for instance: Photos plus geolocation plus filters. Foursquare: restaurant reviews plus check-ins plus geo.
Jack Dorsey


Today,
Building,
Restaurant



















I think Twitter is best when it sparks conversations elsewhere. To use YouTube and Facebook and all the tools we have available to us today to respond and also promote and answer and engage is awesome.
Jack Dorsey


Best,
Today,
Tools



















There's an entire universe in every single tweet, and it all really depends on the content as far as how it's going to spread.
Jack Dorsey


Universe,
Single,
Content
























I loved couriers. You had this transfer of physical information happening throughout the city and the world. Someone picking up the package, putting it in a bag, going somewhere, taking it out of the bag, giving it to someone else. I thought that was so cool. I wanted to map it, to see that flow on a big screen.
Jack Dorsey


Cool,
World,
City



















I said a long time ago that Foursquare can make cities better. You have these augmented realities like Foursquare and Twitter and Facebook that provide these virtual nodes and instant feedback from anywhere, adding annotation around a physical places.
Jack Dorsey


Time,
Feedback,
Long



















I was fascinated with jeans, because you can impress your life upon the jeans you wear. The way you sit imprints on the jeans.
Jack Dorsey


Life,
You,
Way



















Twitter was around communication and visualizing what was happening in the world in real-time. Square was allowing everyone to accept the form of payment people have in their pocket today, which is a credit card.
Jack Dorsey


Communication,
Today,
World



















A number of people in the United States, almost everyone, is using plastic cards to pay for things, but it's extremely difficult to accept these cards. So let's make it's easy and take more and more of the friction out as we can.
Jack Dorsey


People,
Cards,
Accept



















People who are using it to sell things on Craigslist to holding garage sales - campaigns - the Obama campaign and the Romney campaign both used Square to raise funds.
Jack Dorsey


Sales,
People,
Raise



















What I love about New York is just the electricity I feel right away.
Jack Dorsey


Love,
New York,
Electricity
























Twitter has been my life's work in many senses. It started with a fascination with cities and how they work, and what's going on in them right now.
Jack Dorsey


Life,
Work,
Now



















The first complaint we hear from everyone is: 'Why would I want to join this stupid useless thing and know what my brother's eating for lunch?' But that really misses the point because Twitter is fundamentally recipient-controlled - you choose to listen and you choose to leave. But you also choose what to put down and what to share.
Jack Dorsey


Brother,
Stupid,
Lunch



















TweetDeck is a very interesting client, because it presents a view that no other client in the world presents, which is this multicolumn, massive amounts of information in one pane. And people really, really enjoy that.
Jack Dorsey


World,
Enjoy,
Information



















You can follow your favorite company or organization. You can also mix that in with your family and your social network and talk about all these interests in real time. That's the value, not the brand 'Twitter.' Twitter just provides the venue for it.
Jack Dorsey


Family,
Time,
Organization

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

Jack Dorsey (born November 19, 1976) is an American computer programmer and internet entrepreneur widely known as a co-founder and CEO of Twitter, and as the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company.[7] In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8] For 2012, The Wall Street Journal gave him the "Innovator of the Year Award" for technology.[9]

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]




Biz Stone and Dorsey accepting a Crunchie award for best mobile startup


In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]
Main article: Twitter




Dorsey in 2008

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]

Early life[edit]
Dorsey was born and raised in St. Louis,[10][11] the son of Marcia (Smith) and Tim Dorsey.[12][13][14] He is of part Italian descent.[15] His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.[16] He was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati.[17] He went to Catholic high school, at Bishop DuBourg High School.
By age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by many taxi cab companies.[12] Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University.[18] While working on dispatching as a programmer, he later moved to California.[19][20]

In Oakland in 2000, Dorsey started his company to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web.[21] His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a "frictionless service market".[21] In July 2000, building on dispatching[12] and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.[21]
When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared among friends easily.[12] He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging.[12] Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[12] The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams[12] who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.
Twitter[edit]

Williams, Stone and Noah Glass co-founded Obvious Corporation, which then spun off Twitter Inc. with Dorsey as the CEO.[12][22] As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company.[23] He reportedly lost his position for leaving work early to enjoy other pursuits such as yoga and fashion design.[24]
As the service began to grow in popularity, Dorsey chose the improvement of uptime as top priority,[25] even over creating revenue – which, as of 2008, Twitter was not designed to earn.[26] Dorsey described the commercial use of Twitter and its API as two things that could lead to paid features.[26] He describes his three guiding principles, which he says are shared by the company, as simplicity, constraint and craftsmanship.[26]
On October 16, 2008,[27] Williams took over the role of CEO, while Dorsey became chairman of the board.[28][29] On March 28, 2011, Dorsey returned to Twitter as Executive Chairman after Dick Costolo replaced Williams as the CEO.[30] On June 10, 2015, Costolo announced that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter effective July 1, 2015. Dorsey would assume the post of Interim CEO upon Costolo's departure.[31] He was named permanent CEO of Twitter on October 5, 2015.[32] On the day after the controversy about Twitter's new algorithms for tweets, Dorsey responded to the trend saying it was only a hoax.[33]
In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This move was an attempt to entice new users since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 compared to about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.[34]
On November 17, 2016, Dorsey tweeted a public apology for an automated system error that allowed a hate ad to appear on Twitter that violated Twitter's user policy. The error occurred within one day of Twitter suspending multiple accounts associated with the alt-right movement.[35]
On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter user account with 3.9M followers. After restoring the account Dorsey tweeted the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".[36]
In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman Omid Kordestan matched a $530,000 donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers. Their match brought the total donation to $1.59 million.[37]
Square, Inc.[edit]
Main article: Square, Inc.
Dorsey developed a small business platform to accept debit and credit card payments on a mobile device called Square, released in May 2010. The small, square-shaped device attaches to iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android devices via the headphone jack, and as a mini card reader allows a person to swipe their card, choose an amount to transfer to the recipient and then sign their name for confirmation. Square is also a system for sending paperless receipts via text message or email, and is available as a free app for iOS and Android OS.[38][39] The company grew from 10 employees in December 2009[40] to over a hundred employees by June 2011. Square's office is located on Market Street in San Francisco.[41] In September 2012, Business Insider magazine valued Square Inc. at $3.2 billion.[42] Dorsey is CEO of Square, Inc.[43] On October 14, 2015, Square filed for an IPO to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
Other projects[edit]
Producer Tom Anderson and correspondent Lara Logan interviewed Dorsey for a segment of CBS 60 Minutes called "The Innovator: Jack Dorsey" which aired during March 2013.[45] In 2013, talking to CNN, Dorsey expressed admiration for Michael Bloomberg and his reinvention through design and simple interfaces of what it means to be mayor.[46] Dorsey thinks becoming mayor of New York City is an aspiration that would raise the bar for him.[46] He served as a judge for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's NYC BigApps competition in 2011.[47] Dorsey is an on-record donor to Democratic Party candidates.[48]
Dorsey was announced as a new member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company on December 24, 2013. The press release referred to Dorsey as a "talented entrepreneur" and explained that his experience is aligned with the corporation's "strategic priorities."[49]
He is also a board member of the Berggruen Institute's Governance Center.[50][51]
