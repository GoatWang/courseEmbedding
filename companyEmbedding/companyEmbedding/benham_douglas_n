There are approximately 3,400 Arby's restaurants worldwide.  Benham, 47, was the Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of The RTM Restaurant Group ("RTM"), Arby's largest franchisee, where he held positions of increasing responsibility since 1989.

A Certified Public Accountant, Benham received a B.A. summa cum laude in Accounting from the University of West Florida in 1978.  Commenting on Benham's appointment, Nelson Peltz, Triarc's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Doug has been an important force in the Arby's system for a long time. He brings a wealth of operating and financial experience to the Triarc Restaurant Group. We are confident that the Arby's restaurant system will greatly benefit from Doug's leadership and we look forward to working with him, TRG's senior executive team and Arby's franchisees in realizing the system's growth potential."  Commenting on Howe's departure, Nelson Peltz, said: "On behalf of everyone at Triarc, we thank Michael for his many contributions to the Triarc Restaurant Group during his tenure with us. We also wish Michael and his family well."  Russ Umphenour, RTM's Chief Executive Officer, Arby's largest franchisee, with over 700 Arby's stores in the United States, said: "We are appreciative of Michael's hard work and commitment to the Arby's brand over the last several years. We are confident that Doug and the Arby's team will continue to maintain excellent relationships with the franchisees and that the Arby's brand will continue to grow for both its franchisees and Triarc."  Geoff Bailey, Chairman of the Arby's Franchise Service Corporation, an Arby's franchisee association, added: "Arby's has been blessed with good leadership and active ownership. I would expect Doug to step right in and be a major contributor to the Arby's system immediately. We look forward to working with him in his new leadership role at Arby's. We also greatly appreciate Michael's contributions and hard work on behalf of the Arby's brand."  Triarc is a holding company and through its subsidiaries, the franchisor of the Arby's(R) restaurant system and an operator of approximately 240 Arby's restaurants located in the United States.
