Serving Clients Since 2010


480-479-7540







































 
Since 2010 Energy Consulting Services, LLC has helped thousands of homeowners eliminate a majority of their electric bills! Our first step is to acquire your last 12 months of energy usage so we can start configuring what your home’s annual kilowatt hour usage is. After our free initial in home Energy consultation, we order an NRG Energy Efficiency Audit. Once the audit is complete, we form an in-depth report and compile all the deficiencies. Once we meet with our client, we formulate a plan to offset their energy waste. After we have our energy waste settled, we attack the remaining energy usage with Solar. This is the most efficient way to tailor your needs and create the highest energy savings guaranteed! We only promote the Highest Quality Products in the Energy Efficiency and Solar Industry. We pride ourselves in being able to offer the Best Priced Energy Solution and Greatest Value since 2010!

German Attic Fan
The importance of venting your attic cannot be overlooked. In cold climates, improper venting can lead to moisture build-up which causes mold growth, wood rot in extreme cases or even ice in the attic insulation. In hot dry climates, stagnant air can dry out your trusses, increase your energy costs for air conditioning and make your house uncomfortable.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Free Home Solar Quote | Sunrun                                   3 Questions To Ask Before Going Solar There's never been a better time to consider going solar at home. As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
