Description



Welcome to The Second City for Windows Phone - a fan app made by an improv comedy fan for improv comedy fans. This app lets you read humorous pieces, watch videos and follow news from The Second City theatre company. You can also watch comedy videos, browse through fan photos, and get more info on how to contact The Second City in Chicago.

The Second City is the birthplace of improv-based sketch comedy. With theatres in Chicago and Toronto, training centers in those cites as well as Hollywood, 11 full time touring ensembles and multiple theatrical projects as well as television and film operations, Second City is the artistic home for an incomparable list of past, current and up and coming comedy talent. The Second City opened its doors on a snowy Chicago night in December of 1959. No one could have guessed that this small cabaret theatre would become the most influential and prolific comedy theatre in the world.

I want to thank Ben Hauck for introducing me to long-form improvisation and for providing unforgettable improv classes in Manhattan. It truly was a wonderful experience to perform live at the D-Lounge on Union Square, and Caroline's Comedy Club on Broadway.

So, What’s The Second City?
The Second City has been bringing the funny for over 50 years, but here’s the short version.
We began as a small comedy theater, and have grown to become today’s leading brand in improv-based sketch comedy. With a variety of theaters, training centers and full-time, touring ensembles, you can find us all over the world.
We’ve also taken improv off the stage, expanding our business to include collaborations with corporate clients, and television and film productions.
And we have more than a handful of successful Second City alum that we aren’t too modest to mention, like Tina Fey, Chris Farley, Bill Murray, and Keegan-Michael Key.
