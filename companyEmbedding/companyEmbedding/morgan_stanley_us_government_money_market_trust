            From the first day I talked to Jay about my case until the day my case was settled, he made me feel like he truly cared about me as a person, not just a client. I highly recommend Morgan & Morgan to anyone in need. And, I will never be able to thank them enough for what they did for me!

Car Accident Lawyers







At Morgan & Morgan, our attorneys understand the difficulties that can arise after a car accident. We have witnessed the injuries and damage that can result from a crash and understand the struggle some victims may face in trying to recover compensation for their losses.
Our car accident attorneys have handled automobile accident cases in several states and if you’ve suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you.
If you’ve been in a car accident and are unsure of your next step, please fill out our free case review form. Our firm will review your claim for free and determine if our lawyers may be able to help you with your personal injury claim.
How Can a Car Accident Attorney Help Me?
Driving is getting more dangerous. In fact, 35,092 people died in crashes on U.S. roadways in 2015 according to the National Highway Safety Administration.
So having an experienced attorney represent you after your car accident is becoming more important than ever before.
There are specific rules and regulations that can complicate insurance claims and the recovery of additional damages, such as for pain and suffering, in cases of severe injury or death. An attorney can help ensure you receive full benefits from the insurance company and determine whether you can file a claim for additional damages against the party at fault in the event of a car accident.
If you have suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you file a lawsuit to claim compensation beyond what is provided by insurance claims.
Once you’ve exhausted your personal injury protection (PIP) benefits and decide you want to take legal action against the driver at fault for the crash, our attorneys can begin preparing your claim by:

Collecting police and accident scene reports
Questioning witnesses
Reconstructing the accident scene
Taking photographs of the scene, damage, and injuries
Analyzing medical reports
Contacting expert witnesses to review evidence
Speaking with the insurance providers on your behalf

The insurance company or negligent party from which you are attempting to collect compensation will work to categorize your injury as temporary, rather than permanent. Your attorney can collect and organize evidence on your behalf to rebut the defendant’s claims.
Car Accident Injuries and Compensation
Because each accident is different, the extent of injuries suffered will vary between cases. In many cases, the costs for treatment of the injuries sustained will not be covered by PIP insurance and will require additional litigation or negotiations.
Some injuries that we may attempt to collect compensation for include, but are not limited to:

Paralysis
Burns and scars
Loss of limbs
Spinal cord injuries
Head injuries
Joint, muscle, back, neck, and bone injuries
Knee damage
Whiplash
Permanent disability
Wrongful death

If you have suffered any degree of injury, contact us by filling out our free, no-obligation case review form.
Economic auto accident damages, also known as compensatory damages, attempt to compensate the injured car crash victim for his or her monetary losses. Common economic damages awarded in car accident lawsuits include:


Medical Expenses: This could include expenses for emergency room
visits, hospitalization, emergency surgery, any assistive devices and
future appointments with a medical professional.


Future Medical
Expenses: If the car accident victim can prove that they will need
continued medical care as a result of the crash, they may be able to
recover the cost of future medical expenses.


Lost Wages: Car
accident victims who have been injured can seek compensation for lost
wages from the time of injury to the conclusion of the lawsuit. Even if
the victim was unemployed, he or she could receive compensation for lost
wages if the attorney can prove that the accident limited his or her
earning potential.


Loss of Earning Capacity: If you sustained
injuries that prevent you from working, you may be able to receive
compensation by proving that your earning capacity was negatively
impacted by the incident. In this case, the jury will
typically determine the amount the victim could have earned if the car accident had not occurred.


Non-economic car accident damages award the plaintiff for non-financial losses. Car accident damages for non-monetary losses are typically harder to quantify and may include compensation for the following:


Pain and Suffering: This includes compensation for the pain and
suffering you faced after the accident. In awarding damages for pain and
suffering, the jury will examine the extent of your injuries, including
how long you are expected to suffer, the nature of the injury, and what
financial burdens the incident places on you and your family.


Mental
Anguish: You may also be able to attain compensation for the emotional
pain you faced after the incident. Mental anguish, for example, can
include feelings of fright, nervousness, worry, grief, and any other
type of emotional trauma a victim can face after a devastating accident.


Loss of Consortium: The surviving spouse may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society, and companionship of his or her loved one in the case of a wrongful death caused by a car accident. Surviving parents may be awarded compensation for the loss of love, affection and companionship of their minor children as a result of their wrongful death. Likewise, minor children may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society and companionship of their parents as a result of their wrongful death.


Punitive Damages: If the
actions of the defendant were so malicious or egregious, the jury may
impose punitive damages, which are intended to punish the defendant and
discourage similar behavior in the future.


Seeking Additional Damages
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence.
If you are seeking additional damages, your attorney will approach the negligent party’s insurance company in an attempt to recover compensation to cover your remaining costs. Your claim will be submitted for approval to the insurance company, which will have conducted an investigation of its own.
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence. This is no easy task though because the opposing insurance company will want to minimize their payout. 
Providing your attorney with as much information as possible can help strengthen your claim. If your attorney and the insurance company cannot agree on a settlement, the case may proceed to trial.
Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Accidents
After exhausting PIP coverage, if the other driver has no other insurance or an amount of coverage that is insufficient to cover the costs related to your injury, your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage may cover the damage caused by the negligent party.
If the negligent party was underinsured, your insurance will cover the difference between your losses and the amount you received from the other party’s insurance company. If you do not have this coverage, you should contact an attorney to obtain compensation for injuries resulting from the accident.
An attorney may be able to seek damages from the negligent party’s homeowners’ insurance, your own insurance carrier or your health insurance provider. Attempting to collect compensation through your uninsured motorist coverage can be complicated and will likely require the assistance of an experienced attorney.
Your insurance company may try to limit your payout, based on their own investigation of the accident and how much they believe your claim is worth. If you receive an amount that you believe does not properly cover your losses, your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit against your insurance company in an attempt to recover additional compensation.
Types of Car Accident Claims
“No-fault” insurance law attempts to limit the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents. Civil suits to recover additional compensation for personal injury damages are only permitted under certain circumstances, such as:
Negligence
Most car accidents rely on the concept of negligence, or the
party’s failure to exercise a certain level of caution while operating a
vehicle or using common roads. Negligence is one of the most common factors in accidents that harm other motorists, pedestrians, or bicyclists.
To prove negligence, your attorney 
will conduct a preliminary investigation to identify who was responsible for the accident.
To have the best chances of receiving compensation, the attorney must
prove that the defendant failed to meet a reasonable standard of care
and that his or her negligence caused the accident. Some examples of
defendants are negligent drivers, reckless drivers, intoxicated drivers, and bus drivers.
Manufacturer Liability
If your vehicle, or the other party’s vehicle, had a defect contributed
to the accident, the injured party may have a claim against the
manufacturer of the vehicle or one of its parts. If the car had a faulty
design, or a manufacturing and labeling issue, the manufacturer can be
held responsible regardless of who was actually at fault for the
accident.
To prevail, your attorney must prove that you were not at fault for the
accident as the defect that caused the accident occurred during the
manufacturing process. Oftentimes expert testimony and analysis is used
as evidence to prove that the defect contributed in some way to the
accident. Successful lawsuits will require the plaintiff to show:

The defective car or part was “unreasonably dangerous”
The vehicle was being operated as intended
The vehicle’s performance had not changed since its initial purchase

Claims are usually filed against manufacturers in the case of defective parts such as seat belts, airbags, accelerators, brakes, and engines.
Road Design
In some cases, faulty construction, design, or maintenance of roads can contribute to accidents. Some common causes include:


Embankments: When a road curves, the outer edge is set
at an incline as a safety precaution. These raised areas serve the
purpose of managing traffic so that vehicles can approach the outer edge
of the road without driving off it. If the embankment is too steep or
not elevated properly, motorists may be in danger.


Barriers and
Guard Rails: Barriers, guard rails, speed bumps, medians, and
curbs help to influence safe driving. If any of these structures are
poorly designed or placed, driver safety may be compromised.


Surfaces: Various alterations in road surface alert drivers of
approaching hazards or that they are leaving their lane unexpectedly.


Signage: Signs give drivers prior notice of approaching
intersections, sharp turns, animal crossings, etc. They should be
positioned in obvious locations and brightly illuminated for maximum
visibility.


Traffic Control: Traffic lights, stop and
yield signs, lights to warn drivers of intersections and crosswalks, and
other devices are utilized to dictate traffic flow. Proper placement and
operation of these devices are imperative.


Wrongful Death
If you have lost a loved one in a car crash, you may have legal recourse through a wrongful death lawsuit. In these cases, the family or survivors of the victim must prove that their loved one was killed as a result of another’s negligence. Economic, non-economic, and punitive damages may be available.

On June 24, 2016, the Class of the U.S. Government Money Market Trust was redesignated as the "R Class."
On June 28, 2016, the U.S. Government Money Market Trust launched Class S shares.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the Fund's current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Portfolio information and composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single mutual fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Subsidized(Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect. Current yield is a measure that looks at the current price of a bond instead of its face value and represents the return an investor would expect if he or she purchased the bond and held it for a year. Calculated by dividing the Annual Cash Inflows / Market Price. The 7-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 7 days. SEC 30-day yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield - Un-Subsidized (Un-Sub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Weighted average maturity (WAM). Maturity measures the number of days remaining in the life of a bond. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio's individual holdings. Weighted average life (WAL). A measure of sensitivity to liquidity and/or credit risk. Weighted average life takes into account all call options exercised by the issuer as well as permissible maturity shortening devices such as demand features.
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Funds’ sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(8) (defining “daily liquid asset” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day).
2 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(32) (defining “weekly liquid assets” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days).
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolios. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/liquidity or call 1.800.236.0992. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.


 






 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

            From the first day I talked to Jay about my case until the day my case was settled, he made me feel like he truly cared about me as a person, not just a client. I highly recommend Morgan & Morgan to anyone in need. And, I will never be able to thank them enough for what they did for me!

So having an experienced attorney represent you after your car accident is becoming more important than ever before.
There are specific rules and regulations that can complicate insurance claims and the recovery of additional damages, such as for pain and suffering, in cases of severe injury or death. An attorney can help ensure you receive full benefits from the insurance company and determine whether you can file a claim for additional damages against the party at fault in the event of a car accident.
If you have suffered any degree of injury, we may be able to help you file a lawsuit to claim compensation beyond what is provided by insurance claims.
Once you’ve exhausted your personal injury protection (PIP) benefits and decide you want to take legal action against the driver at fault for the crash, our attorneys can begin preparing your claim by:

Collecting police and accident scene reports
Questioning witnesses
Reconstructing the accident scene
Taking photographs of the scene, damage, and injuries
Analyzing medical reports
Contacting expert witnesses to review evidence
Speaking with the insurance providers on your behalf

The insurance company or negligent party from which you are attempting to collect compensation will work to categorize your injury as temporary, rather than permanent. Your attorney can collect and organize evidence on your behalf to rebut the defendant’s claims.
Car Accident Injuries and Compensation
Because each accident is different, the extent of injuries suffered will vary between cases. In many cases, the costs for treatment of the injuries sustained will not be covered by PIP insurance and will require additional litigation or negotiations.
Some injuries that we may attempt to collect compensation for include, but are not limited to:

Paralysis
Burns and scars
Loss of limbs
Spinal cord injuries
Head injuries
Joint, muscle, back, neck, and bone injuries
Knee damage
Whiplash
Permanent disability
Wrongful death

If you have suffered any degree of injury, contact us by filling out our free, no-obligation case review form.
Economic auto accident damages, also known as compensatory damages, attempt to compensate the injured car crash victim for his or her monetary losses. Common economic damages awarded in car accident lawsuits include:


Medical Expenses: This could include expenses for emergency room
visits, hospitalization, emergency surgery, any assistive devices and
future appointments with a medical professional.


Future Medical
Expenses: If the car accident victim can prove that they will need
continued medical care as a result of the crash, they may be able to
recover the cost of future medical expenses.


Lost Wages: Car
accident victims who have been injured can seek compensation for lost
wages from the time of injury to the conclusion of the lawsuit. Even if
the victim was unemployed, he or she could receive compensation for lost
wages if the attorney can prove that the accident limited his or her
earning potential.


Loss of Earning Capacity: If you sustained
injuries that prevent you from working, you may be able to receive
compensation by proving that your earning capacity was negatively
impacted by the incident. In this case, the jury will
typically determine the amount the victim could have earned if the car accident had not occurred.


Non-economic car accident damages award the plaintiff for non-financial losses. Car accident damages for non-monetary losses are typically harder to quantify and may include compensation for the following:


Pain and Suffering: This includes compensation for the pain and
suffering you faced after the accident. In awarding damages for pain and
suffering, the jury will examine the extent of your injuries, including
how long you are expected to suffer, the nature of the injury, and what
financial burdens the incident places on you and your family.


Mental
Anguish: You may also be able to attain compensation for the emotional
pain you faced after the incident. Mental anguish, for example, can
include feelings of fright, nervousness, worry, grief, and any other
type of emotional trauma a victim can face after a devastating accident.


Loss of Consortium: The surviving spouse may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society, and companionship of his or her loved one in the case of a wrongful death caused by a car accident. Surviving parents may be awarded compensation for the loss of love, affection and companionship of their minor children as a result of their wrongful death. Likewise, minor children may be awarded compensation for the loss of services, assistance, aid, society and companionship of their parents as a result of their wrongful death.


Punitive Damages: If the
actions of the defendant were so malicious or egregious, the jury may
impose punitive damages, which are intended to punish the defendant and
discourage similar behavior in the future.


Seeking Additional Damages
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence.
If you are seeking additional damages, your attorney will approach the negligent party’s insurance company in an attempt to recover compensation to cover your remaining costs. Your claim will be submitted for approval to the insurance company, which will have conducted an investigation of its own.
The strength and success of your claim will likely hinge on the ability of your attorney to collect, analyze, and present evidence. This is no easy task though because the opposing insurance company will want to minimize their payout. 
Providing your attorney with as much information as possible can help strengthen your claim. If your attorney and the insurance company cannot agree on a settlement, the case may proceed to trial.
Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Accidents
After exhausting PIP coverage, if the other driver has no other insurance or an amount of coverage that is insufficient to cover the costs related to your injury, your uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage may cover the damage caused by the negligent party.
If the negligent party was underinsured, your insurance will cover the difference between your losses and the amount you received from the other party’s insurance company. If you do not have this coverage, you should contact an attorney to obtain compensation for injuries resulting from the accident.
An attorney may be able to seek damages from the negligent party’s homeowners’ insurance, your own insurance carrier or your health insurance provider. Attempting to collect compensation through your uninsured motorist coverage can be complicated and will likely require the assistance of an experienced attorney.
Your insurance company may try to limit your payout, based on their own investigation of the accident and how much they believe your claim is worth. If you receive an amount that you believe does not properly cover your losses, your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit against your insurance company in an attempt to recover additional compensation.
Types of Car Accident Claims
“No-fault” insurance law attempts to limit the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents. Civil suits to recover additional compensation for personal injury damages are only permitted under certain circumstances, such as:
Negligence
Most car accidents rely on the concept of negligence, or the
party’s failure to exercise a certain level of caution while operating a
vehicle or using common roads. Negligence is one of the most common factors in accidents that harm other motorists, pedestrians, or bicyclists.
To prove negligence, your attorney 
will conduct a preliminary investigation to identify who was responsible for the accident.
To have the best chances of receiving compensation, the attorney must
prove that the defendant failed to meet a reasonable standard of care
and that his or her negligence caused the accident. Some examples of
defendants are negligent drivers, reckless drivers, intoxicated drivers, and bus drivers.
Manufacturer Liability
If your vehicle, or the other party’s vehicle, had a defect contributed
to the accident, the injured party may have a claim against the
manufacturer of the vehicle or one of its parts. If the car had a faulty
design, or a manufacturing and labeling issue, the manufacturer can be
held responsible regardless of who was actually at fault for the
accident.
To prevail, your attorney must prove that you were not at fault for the
accident as the defect that caused the accident occurred during the
manufacturing process. Oftentimes expert testimony and analysis is used
as evidence to prove that the defect contributed in some way to the
accident. Successful lawsuits will require the plaintiff to show:

The defective car or part was “unreasonably dangerous”
The vehicle was being operated as intended
The vehicle’s performance had not changed since its initial purchase

Claims are usually filed against manufacturers in the case of defective parts such as seat belts, airbags, accelerators, brakes, and engines.
Road Design
In some cases, faulty construction, design, or maintenance of roads can contribute to accidents. Some common causes include:


Embankments: When a road curves, the outer edge is set
at an incline as a safety precaution. These raised areas serve the
purpose of managing traffic so that vehicles can approach the outer edge
of the road without driving off it. If the embankment is too steep or
not elevated properly, motorists may be in danger.


Barriers and
Guard Rails: Barriers, guard rails, speed bumps, medians, and
curbs help to influence safe driving. If any of these structures are
poorly designed or placed, driver safety may be compromised.


Surfaces: Various alterations in road surface alert drivers of
approaching hazards or that they are leaving their lane unexpectedly.


Signage: Signs give drivers prior notice of approaching
intersections, sharp turns, animal crossings, etc. They should be
positioned in obvious locations and brightly illuminated for maximum
visibility.


Traffic Control: Traffic lights, stop and
yield signs, lights to warn drivers of intersections and crosswalks, and
other devices are utilized to dictate traffic flow. Proper placement and
operation of these devices are imperative.


Wrongful Death
If you have lost a loved one in a car crash, you may have legal recourse through a wrongful death lawsuit. In these cases, the family or survivors of the victim must prove that their loved one was killed as a result of another’s negligence. Economic, non-economic, and punitive damages may be available.

Is my money safe?

How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.

The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/21/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.
EverBank promises that the yield on your Yield Pledge® Checking and/or Money Market Account will stay in the Top 5% of Competitive Accounts based on Bankrate Monitor National Index survey data from the last week of each month.

This includes data from the 5 largest banks and 5 largest thrifts in each market, except in markets without 5 banks and 5 thrifts. Each week Bankrate.com surveys these institutions and distributes its results on a paid subscription basis. Not all institutions report each week. EverBank reserves the right to change its Yield Pledge calculation method as necessary to accommodate changes in Bankrate's survey methodology at any time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
