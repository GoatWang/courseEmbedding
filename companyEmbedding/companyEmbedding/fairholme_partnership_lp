Fairholme Capital Management Launches the Fairholme Partnership for 
      Institutional Investors




Absence of Management Fee Supports Pay for Performance






October 06, 2013 08:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Fairholme Partnership, L.P. (“Partnership”) today announced that it 
      is offering interests to institutional investors.1 The 
      Partnership launched in January 2013 with seed capital from employees of 
      its investment adviser, Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C. 
      (“Fairholme”), and currently has approximately $140 million in assets. 
      The Partnership is designed for investors who share Fairholme’s 
      contrarian, disciplined, and patient investment approach. Advised by 
      Fairholme and its Chief Investment Officer Bruce R. Berkowitz, the 
      Partnership pursues a focused, event-driven, fundamental value strategy. 
      As of September 30, 2013, the year-to-date return of the Partnership is 
      23%.2



      The Partnership seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in a 
      focused portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities acquired at 
      prices well below Fairholme’s estimate of intrinsic value. Such 
      securities may include preferred and common stock, bank debt, 
      convertible securities and bonds, warrants, and interests in real estate 
      investment trusts. The Partnership may also engage in opportunistic 
      hedges and invest in special situations such as reorganizations, 
      recapitalizations, restructurings, and other corporate transactional 
      events.
    

      The Partnership offers investors three subscription options: Series One 
      has a rolling five-year lock-up with a 15% incentive allocation; Series 
      Two has a rolling three-year lock-up with a 20% incentive allocation; 
      and Series Three has a rolling one-year lock-up with a 25% incentive 
      allocation. The Partnership is not subject to a management fee and each 
      series will have a high-water mark. The minimum investment amount is $5 
      million, subject to waiver in the sole discretion of the general partner 
      of the Partnership. Non-U.S. persons and U.S. tax-exempt investors may 
      access the Partnership by investing in an offshore fund available to 
      such investors.
    

      “The absence of a management fee for The Fairholme Partnership further 
      differentiates us from the crowd,” said Mr. Berkowitz, “and reflects our 
      ongoing commitment to closely align our interests with those of our 
      investors.”
    

      The Partnership portfolio may shift across asset classes and market 
      sectors from time to time based upon the adviser’s assessment of the 
      relative attractiveness of investment opportunities, general market and 
      economic conditions, fundamental values of securities, as well as 
      expected future returns of investments.
    

About Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C.


      Fairholme Capital Management is a value-oriented, long-term focused 
      investment adviser providing advisory services to various types of 
      clients, including mutual funds with over 200,000 shareholders. We 
      invest in companies whose securities are trading below our estimate of 
      intrinsic value and hold them until we believe the market accurately 
      reflects their fair value. We adhere to the fundamental investment 
      principles of Benjamin Graham & David Dodd.
    

      Founded in 1997 by Bruce R. Berkowitz, Fairholme has 24 full-time 
      employees and is based in Miami, Florida.
    

      As of September 2013, Fairholme has approximately $10.5 billion in 
      assets under management across three public mutual funds, a separately 
      managed account program, and The Fairholme Partnership (and its offshore 
      feeder fund).
    

      In 2010, Mr. Berkowitz was selected as Morningstar’s® first Domestic-Stock 
      Fund Manager of the Decade. The Fund Manager of the Decade award is 
      given for “delivering outstanding long-term performance, aligning 
      interests with shareholders, and demonstrating the courage to differ 
      from consensus.”
    



1 This document does not constitute an offer to sell or 
          the solicitation of an offer to buy, which may only be made at the 
          time a qualified offeree receives a confidential private offering 
          memorandum, which contains important information (including 
          investment objective, policies, risk factors, fees and tax 
          implications), and only in those jurisdictions where permitted by 
          law. Investors should not construe the contents of this document as 
          legal, tax, investment or other advice. The Fairholme Partnership 
          (“Partnership”) limits its investors to those meeting the 
          definitions of accredited investor in Regulation D under the 
          Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and qualified purchaser 
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”). Interests in 
          the Partnership (“Interests”) are being offered in reliance on an 
          exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
          The Securities and Exchange Commission has not passed on the merits 
          of the offering or given its approval. The Partnership is not 
          registered under the 1940 Act and therefore the offering is not 
          subject to the investment protections of the 1940 Act. Investing in 
          Interests involves risk, and investors should be able to bear the 
          loss of their investment. Interests have limited liquidity. No 
          secondary market for Interests is expected to develop, and there are 
          legal restrictions on an investor’s ability to withdraw, transfer, 
          and resell Interests. The investment program of the Partnership is 
          speculative and involves risk. The investment portfolio of the 
          Partnership is expected to be concentrated on a limited number of 
          issuers thereby increasing the risk to the Partnership of losses due 
          to adverse events affecting any issuer in the portfolio. There can 
          be no assurance that the Partnership’s investment objective will be 
          achieved.
        





2 YTD performance for Series One Interests is an 
          unaudited estimate based on the performance of The Fairholme 
          Partnership from January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013. 
          Performance is net of all Series One expenses (including brokerage 
          and other trading costs) and reflects the reinvestment of dividends 
          and interest. The 2013 YTD performance does not reflect the 
          deduction of any incentive allocation, which if reflected would 
          reduce the performance returns shown. The Partnership’s incentive 
          allocations and other expenses may offset or exceed trading profits. 
          Past performance is not an indication of future performance. The 
          investment return and principal value of an investment in the 
          Partnership will fluctuate so that an investor’s interests in the 
          Partnership, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their 
          original cost. The Partnership’s performance may be volatile. 
          Current performance of the Series One Interests may be lower or 
          higher than the performance quoted. Performance of the Series will 
          differ.
