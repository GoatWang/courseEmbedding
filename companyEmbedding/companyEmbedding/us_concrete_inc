Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education will receive a draft report on Wednesday that could recommend closing or merging some of the 14 taxpayer-funded universities that have struggled with rising costs and falling enrollments.The interim report, produced by a Colorado-based nonprofit, will be released during the PASSHE Board of Governors’ meeting in Harrisburg. The noon meeting’s agenda also includes possible votes on tuition and fee rate increases for the 2017-18 school year that begins with the fall semester.Whether you go in person or watch on a live stream at home, you will see the report at the same time Chancellor Frank Brogan and the board do.“We'll learn what they have to say at the same time as everyone else,” said PASSHE spokesman Kenn Marshall. “We'll get their formal report probably in a week or so.”Regardless of the report’s findings, all universities will open in the fall for more than 100,000 students, said Rep. Matt Baker, R-Tiogoa, a PASSHE board member whose district includes Mansfield University, one of the system’s most stressed schools.“Any recommendations or suggestions will be carefully reviewed and discussed by the board,” Baker said. “But it will take some time for us all to have time to weigh any and all suggestions and recommendations.”The National Center for Higher Education Management Systems was hired in March under a $400,000 contract.The non-profit looked at how schools and the Office of the Chancellor can be more viable and sustainable amid a 5 percent enrollment drop in the last decade and intense competition from private and for-profit colleges, community colleges, and semi-public research universities like Penn State, Temple and Pittsburgh that operate regional campuses.

National Center representatives visited campuses and met with students and staff, state and local lawmakers and business officials.If the report recommends closures or mergers, the Legislature and Gov. Tom Wolf or his successor would have final say.“[It] likely would require a change in the law that established the state system (Act 188 of 1982), since it specifically lists the state universities,” Marshall said.PASSHE consists of Kutztown, East Stroudsburg, Cheyney, Bloomsburg, California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana, Lock Haven, Mansfield, Millersville, Shippensburg, Slippery Rock and West Chester universities. Not all of those schools are struggling.On a financial and enrollment basis, Mansfield's and Cheney Univeristy, the nation’s oldest college for African Americans, are in the worst shape. By comparison, West Chester University, in the expanding Philadelphia suburb of Chester County, is bursting with students.Closing any of those campuses could create far-reaching negative economic impact. Most PASSHE schools were founded in rural communities in the 1800s and the campuses remain economic and cultural hubs.A 2015 PASSHE study said the universities generate more than $6.7 billion annually in the state. That figure was based on taxes paid by its own 12,000 employees and 62,000 jobs at local businesses that rely on employees and students as customers.Economic ramifications are the reason why public universities are rarely shutdown, National Center Vice President Patrick Kelly previously told The Morning Call.PASSHE universities offer more than 2,300 degree and certificate programs in more than 530 academic areas. But Harrisburg’s financial commitment has waned as costs have risen.In 1983-84, when there were more students, state tax dollars accounted for 63 percent of PASSHE’s $384.1 million operating budget. In the 2016-17 fiscal year that just ended, tax dollars equaled 28 percent of PASSHE's $1.6 billion operating budget.The Legislature andWolf increased PASSHE’s funding by about 2 percent to $453 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year budget that started July 1.Everyone looks immediately to closing struggling campuses to save money, said Sen. Judy Schwank, D-Berks, another PASSHE board member whose district includes Kutztown.The ultimate goal of the report, she said, should be what is best for students, from 18-year high school graduate to the adult learner to someone studying online.“I hope the report will offer us concrete ideas to fine tune the system to take it back to its roots to help all Pennsylvanians get a low-cost, high quality education,” Schwank said. “I think we’ve moved away from that.”THE LATESTYears of enrollment drops, rising costs and reduced state funding have financially strained the State System of Higher Education's 14 universities.On Wednesday, PASSHE’s consultant, the nonprofit National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, will release its report on how to make the system more sustainable, which could include mergers and consolidations.

EducationLow CO2 ConcreteSustainabilitySustainability Strategy 



Sustainability
U.S. Concrete recognizes the inherent value in aggressively supporting sustainable construction and green building initiatives. Through our high performance, low 
CO2 concrete mixes (EF Technology®) and Certified Concrete Sustainability Specialists (CCSS), we continue to contribute to the building of projects that are environmentally responsible, cost-effective and healthy places to live and work.
Concrete is the future of sustainable construction

Increasingly, concrete is being recognized for its life cycle environmental and economical benefits, from extraction and production, to construction, maintenance and disposal. There are solid facts that make concrete the right choice for effective sustainable development.
CO2 emission – The use of recycled materials in concrete reduces greenhouse gasses, frees up landfill space, and reduces raw material consumption.
Recyclable – After a concrete structure has served its original purpose, the concrete can be crushed and recycled into aggregate for use in new concrete or as a backfill or road base.
Environmental and cost benefits – The use of concrete pavement and roofing in our urban areas and roadways means that more light is reflected and less heat is absorbed. This may result in significant energy savings and healthier and safer communities.
Reduces storm water waste – Pervious concrete is a strong type of pavement with a porous structure that allows rainwater to pass directly through the pavement and into the soil naturally.
Energy efficient – Buildings constructed of concrete have a unique energy-saving advantage because of their inherent thermal mass. In addition, insulated concrete wall systems are a technology that can be more energy-efficient than traditional or wood construction.
Durability – Concrete offers significant strength over other building materials. It can sustain natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes and tsunamis. Concrete conserves resources by reducing the need for reconstruction.

Increasingly, concrete is being recognized for its life cycle environmental and economical benefits, from extraction and production, to construction, maintenance and disposal. There are solid facts that make concrete the right choice for effective sustainable development.
CO2 emission – The use of recycled materials in concrete reduces greenhouse gasses, frees up landfill space, and reduces raw material consumption.
Recyclable – After a concrete structure has served its original purpose, the concrete can be crushed and recycled into aggregate for use in new concrete or as a backfill or road base.
Environmental and cost benefits – The use of concrete pavement and roofing in our urban areas and roadways means that more light is reflected and less heat is absorbed. This may result in significant energy savings and healthier and safer communities.
Reduces storm water waste – Pervious concrete is a strong type of pavement with a porous structure that allows rainwater to pass directly through the pavement and into the soil naturally.
Energy efficient – Buildings constructed of concrete have a unique energy-saving advantage because of their inherent thermal mass. In addition, insulated concrete wall systems are a technology that can be more energy-efficient than traditional or wood construction.
Durability – Concrete offers significant strength over other building materials. It can sustain natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes and tsunamis. Concrete conserves resources by reducing the need for reconstruction.

U.S. Concrete focuses on helping architects, builders, and engineers achieve their design and building objectives. As design innovations and environmental sensibility continue to evolve, we understand the need for sustainable, low carbon concrete products that perform and help translate innovative designs into structural forms, while reducing environmental impact.
In the simplest term, concrete conserves resources by reducing the need for reconstruction, but that is not what concrete is all about. Increasingly, concrete is being recognized for it’s life cycle environmental and economical benefits, from extraction and production, to construction, maintenance and disposal. Furthermore, architects and engineers are discovering the advantages of concrete construction as the quality construction material that stands the test of time. The emerging concrete technologies are opening new possibilities for concrete architecture, and inspiring contemporary architects and designers around the world.
The use of concrete in buildings has many benefits that span all stakeholders.






For designers – Not only has concrete proved to be the material of mass structures, but also has become architectural facades, surfaces, and even furniture – the possibilities of its applications seem to be getting broader every day.
Precast concrete provides many functional and design structural benefits. The flexible aesthetic possibilities of precast concrete make it a building material that can fit into any design.
Concrete can help achieve LEED certification.
Recycled materials in concrete reduce CO2 emission.
Concrete pavement can be used to reduce urban heat islands. Concrete’s light color reflects more energy and absorb less heat, thereby reducing energy usage and costs.
Pervious concrete helps conserve storm water runoff by offering a porous structure that allows rainwater to pass directly through the pavement and into the soil naturally. See sustainable construction.
Concrete’s extreme durability and strength allows architects to design longer spans with less supporting columns making more usable floor space available.
Concrete’s superior strength protects against storms and natural disasters. Additionally, concrete construction offers a high level of fire resistance.
The availability of materials with on-site or cast-in-place concrete provides project managers with significant time savings, as opposed to long delivery time for another construction materials like steel.
