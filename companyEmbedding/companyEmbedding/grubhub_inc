GrubHub's stock surges after analyst says company could be Amazon's next takeover target
Shares of GrubHub Inc.  surged 5.2% toward a more-than two-year high in morning trade Monday, after Wedbush Securities suggested the online food-ordering company may be Amazon.com Inc.'s  next takeover target, following the Whole Foods Market Inc.  deal. With Amazon's focus now "squarely on food delivery," analyst Aaron Turner said he believes there is a "sound" rationale for Amazon to buy GrubHub. He said Amazon has already tried to launch its restaurant delivery business with Restaurants, with little success. "The company has been unable to capture any significant user traction and restaurant acquisition has been lackluster," Turner wrote in a note to clients. "During the same time, [GrubHub] has successfully expanded into new markets, reaccelerated user and revenue growth and is rapidly scaling its delivery infrastructure." He reiterated his outperform rating on GrubHub and his stock price target of $50, which would imply a market capitalization of $4.31 billion. The stock has run up 21% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.4%.

Its portfolio of brands include Grubhub, Seamless, AllMenus and MenuPages operating under Grubhub leadership. Founded in 2004, Grubhub has offices in Chicago, New York and London.

In September 2011, Grubhub acquired competitor Dotmenu, the parent company of AllMenus and campusfood while in October 2011, Seamless acquired MenuPages. In May 2013, Grubhub and Seamless which was founded in 1999, merged. On April 4, 2014, Grubhub opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB" following its initial public offering. Since then it has completed acquisitions of DiningIn (February 2015),  Restaurants on the Run (March 2015), Delivered Dish (December 2015), Bask Labs (April 2016) and LAbite (May 2016). All these businesses have been absorbed within the parent Grubhub.

On, June 8, 2017 Grubhub announced that it has entered into an agreement for an all-cash transaction to acquire Boston-based Foodler. The transaction which is subject to closing conditions will extend Grubhub's presence in New England and add more than $80 million of annualized gross food sales in 2017. 
• GrubHub Seamless maintains a $50-100,000 contract to source its computer peripherals (computer monitor, printers, etc.).
• GrubHub Seamless maintains a $50-100,000 dollar sourcing contract for its desktop and workstation equipment.

• GrubHub Seamless maintains a $50-100,000 dollar sourcing contract for its desktop and workstation equipment.

2013 and Earlier:
GrubHub Seamless offers online restaurant ordering for both pick-up and delivery.

The company uses ViaWest for its Web hosting services.

IT Priorities:
•GrubHub and Seamless merged in Q2-Q3 to form GrubHub Seamless. While Chicago-based GrubHub and New York-based Seamless will continue to be separate websites at this time, as will other entities under the parent umbrella such as MenuPages and Allmenus, there will likely be some integration of technology resources. The company announced plans to evaluate the platforms in use.
•The main focus of the IT department at Seamless, which will likely remain the same in the combined company, is the development of enterprise software to improve the process efficiency of the company.

IT Structure:
•The Chief Information Officer of GrubHub Seamless was previously the CIO at Seamless.
•While the merged company will maintain its headquarters at Seamless' old headquarters in New York, NY, most IT employees at Seamless work out of Sandy, UT, where the data center is located.

Grubhub Unveils New In-Restaurant Technology

GrubCentral Makes Managing Online Orders Easier Than Ever

CHICAGO, May 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Grubhub, the nation's leading online and mobile food-ordering and delivery platform, today announced the launch of GrubCentral, the company's new in-restaurant technology platform. Accessible from any device, the GrubCentral platform makes it easy for restaurants to manage their menus, review Grubhub financial statements and easily process orders from any device. 

GrubCentral raises the bar on efficiency and functionality standards for in-house restaurant technology. It offers significant improvements over the first in-house restaurant technology, OrderHub, which Grubhub introduced in 2012. OrderHub is an Android app that allowed restaurants to manage online orders received via Grubhub.
"We are completely focused on connecting diners and restaurants, offering the best and broadest set of restaurant choices to diners and positively impacting the bottom line of our restaurant partners," said Sudev Balakrishnan, SVP of Product for Grubhub. "We're thrilled that GrubCentral will make the lives of restaurant owners easier by improving accessibility, enabling real-time menu updates and offering tighter integration with our delivery drivers. Efficiencies driven by this new product will give time back to our restaurant partners to focus on what they love: serving up delicious food."
A snapshot of GrubCentral's new features include: 

Access from any device, anywhere - Restaurants can opt for a Grubhub-provided tablet, or they can use a web browser on their own hardware. This clears up the crowded, tablet-filled counter space, allowing owners to manage financials in a back office while staff can continue to manage orders from the front of the house. 
Manage menus in real-time - Restaurants will be able to create and modify their online Grubhub menu in real-time, giving them control and flexibility over their menu. This enables restaurant owners to instantaneously change and update menu items, including daily specials that are being offered. 
Integrated Grubhub Delivery features - Owners are given real-time status updates on driver location. In combination with map tracking, this helps restaurants decide when to fire food and also allows access to each driver's contact info, so restaurants can reach out to drivers to check on orders or resolve issues. 
"We pride ourselves on our in-house, chef driven specials," said Rick Jurmark, General Manager of EJ's Luncheonette in New York City. "With GrubCentral's menu management capabilities, it's been a game changer when it comes to offering daily specials. We can easily update our menu with just a few clicks, allowing us to provide a more diverse menu selection and increase our order volume while improving recognition of our brand." 
GrubCentral is being used by thousands of restaurants and will continue to be offered to more restaurants over the coming months.

Grubhub generates 39% revenue growth in the first quarter

CHICAGO, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Grubhub Inc. (NYSE: GRUB), the nation's leading takeout marketplace, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. DAGs grew 21% year-over-year, and the Company posted quarterly revenues of $156.1 million, which is a 39% year-over-year increase from $112.2 million in the first quarter of 2016.
"More new diners tried Grubhub than ever before in the first quarter. We are seeing clear signs of success from a more diverse restaurant base, broader marketing reach, and continuous improvement of our product," said Matt Maloney, Grubhub CEO. "We already had the most comprehensive takeout marketplace in the U.S., and delivery has enabled our restaurant network to grow significantly in both breadth and depth, making Grubhub the place to go for online takeout."
First Quarter 2017 Highlights
The following results reflect the financial performance and key operating metrics of our business for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.
First Quarter Financial Highlights

Revenues: $156.1 million, a 39% year-over-year increase from $112.2 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Net Income: $17.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, a 78% year-over-year increase from $9.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016.
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: $42.7 million, a 32% year-over-year increase from $32.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Non-GAAP Net Income: $25.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, a 46% year-over-year increase from $17.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016.
First Quarter Key Business Metrics Highlights

Active Diners were 8.75 million, a 26% year-over-year increase from 6.97 million Active Diners in the first quarter of 2016.
Daily Average Grubs (DAGs) were 324,600, a 21% year-over-year increase from 267,800 Daily Average Grubs in the first quarter of 2016.
Gross Food Sales were $898 million, a 26% year-over-year increase from $713 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
"Grubhub's growth on both sides of our network helped drive DAGs growth of 21% and EBITDA growth of 32% compared to the prior year," said Adam DeWitt, Grubhub CFO. "We generated significant operating leverage, in part due to our continued improvement in delivery efficiency. As a result, EBITDA per order was up 10% year over year to $1.46, even while we invested aggressively in product and marketing to drive future growth." 
Second Quarter and Full Year 2017 Guidance
Based on information available as of April 27, 2017, the Company is providing the following financial guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2017:

Use of Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding management's future expectations, beliefs, intentions, goals, strategies, plans and prospects, including the expected financial performance of Grubhub following its recent acquisitions and investment in delivery. Such statements constitute "forward-looking" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the matters set forth in the filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including those set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on Feb. 28, 2017, which is on file with the SEC and are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://investors.grubhub.com/. Additional information will be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that will be filed for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2017, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results. Please also note that forward-looking statements represent management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.  
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude acquisition and restructuring costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders exclude acquisition and restructuring costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and other nonrecurring items as well as the income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of acquisitions and restructuring, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.
See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation" below for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to common stockholders.
