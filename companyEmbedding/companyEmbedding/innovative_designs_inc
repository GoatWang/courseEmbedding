Get Started with IDP
Please fill out the form to the right and someone from our staff will contact you within 24 hours. Or call Jennifer Rivkind at 949.748.1902 to discuss your project and obtain a full explanation of our development process.



IP Protection: IDP understands the importance of protecting your unique idea. We’ll send you a signed Non Disclosure Agreement. We’re also happy to sign your NDA.

Custom Development Plan/Quote: Once we learn about your specific product and development needs, we can put together a custom product development plan. Our engineers will confirm your product requirements and provide expert feedback on your product. The custom product development plan explains in detail all the steps, stages, costs and timeframes to design, engineer and prototype your product. It can be used for comparison and is something that can be built into your business plan or investor documents.

Custom Development Plan Fee: We charge $500 to $1,000 for this initial work packet. It takes about 7 days and is credited back to you if you decide to continue working with us within 30 days of the proposal date.

Dedicated Team: Each project requires a unique team of experts. Once you engage IDP, we will assign the appropriate team of designers, engineers, prototype fabricators and manufacturing experts to develop your product. You will also be assigned a project manager who will communicate with you throughout the process.
