The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund’s I Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s A Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s C Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The five-year rating for C Shares is based on extended performance, using historical adjusted returns prior to the inception date of the Class C shares (Class C inception was 3/31/14), and reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class (inception date for Class I and A was 2/17/11), adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of the Class C shares. These star ratings for all share classes were among Energy Limited Partnership Funds with 76 funds in the three year period and 34 funds in the five year period. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

The Fund is offered only to United States residents and information on this website is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is nondiversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund will invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) which concentrate investments in the natural resource sector and are subject to the risks of energy prices and demand and the volatility of commodity investments. Damage to facilities and infrastructure of MLPs may significantly affect the value of an investment and may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their business. MLPs are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment. Investments in smaller companies involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. MLPs are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including complex tax structure risks, limited ability for election or removal of management, limited voting rights, potential dependence on parent companies or sponsors for revenues to satisfy obligations, and potential conflicts of interest between partners, members and affiliates.
An investment in the Fund does not receive the same tax advantages as a direct investment in the MLP. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation or “C” corporation and is therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at rates applicable to corporations (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. MLP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result the MLP Fund’s after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. The potential tax benefits from investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Return of Capital: A return, by the Fund, of an investor's monies that is not considered income and therefore is not taxed because its amount does not exceed the original investment.

The MainGate MLP Mutual Fund: A Synergy of MLP Opportunity and Mutual Fund Convenience
Investment Objectives
The MainGate MLP Fund is constructed with a Total Return perspective. Chickasaw Capital Management concentrates on MLP interests that it deems attractive in the current market based on a variety of key considerations. Our primary investment objective is total return by pursuing the generation of current income combined with the appreciation of capital.
Fund Benefits
The MainGate MLP Fund offers access to the MLP market with the convenience of implementing a Mutual Fund.

1099 tax reporting
No K-1s
No UBTI
MLP sector performance compared to broader equity markets and other asset classes (see Figure MG-1)
Income and growth potential
Liquidity, transparency and flexibility of a Mutual Fund
Inflation-hedging potential
Qualified retirement plan eligibility
IRA eligibility
Portfolio diversification

Capital Gains
Due to the Fund’s "C" corporation tax structure, shareholders receive a 1099 DIV statement that reflects income received and Return of Capital associated with quarterly distributions for the year. There will be no capital gains reflected on the 1099.
Potential capital gain/loss activity from the Fund’s investment portfolio is handled at the Fund level and does not flow to the Fund shareholder via their 1099.
Investment Strategies
Distribution Stability and Growth Profile. Chickasaw Capital Management seeks MLPs that continue their record of achieving earnings growth through operational expansion, rate increases and acquisitions. Recent years have seen many major oil companies divest midstream energy assets, providing an opportunity for MLPs to acquire these assets at attractive valuations — a practice that may in all likelihood continue. Since MLPs tend to distribute the bulk of their available cash to unit holders, Chickasaw Capital Management believes that distributions should continue to increase as MLPs increase their earnings.
Strategic Value of Energy Infrastructure Assets. MLPs in certain industries that operate strategically important assets — such as the pipelines that deliver crude oil, refined products and natural gas — have a history of generating stable and predictable cash flows. Chickasaw Capital Management believes that the fee-based models of MLPs such as these — which are unrelated to commodity prices — combined with the long-term importance of their midstream energy assets, may position these MLPs to generate stable cash flows throughout economic cycles due to the inelastic nature of demand. MLP product pipelines tend to be regulated by federal and state authorities to ensure that rates are fair, which may include inflationary rate increases that provide an environment for highly predictable cash flows.
Position Within the MLP Sector. Chickasaw Capital Management typically seeks well-established MLPs with more significant asset bases and operations as these may enjoy a competitive advantage over other entities seeking to enter the market. Due to the many challenges involved in creating new rights-of-way, the lower cost of expanding rather than constructing new assets, not to mention the complexities involved in regulating such assets, the barriers that must be overcome to gain entry to the midstream energy sector are relatively high. This being said, Chickasaw Capital Management would remain mindful of smaller, less-seasoned MLPs should our research and evaluation processes present a clear and present opportunity to achieve the overall investment objective of the Fund.
Inefficient Market Conditions. Because of a lack of broad institutional ownership and in-depth research, the market for MLPs is often inefficient, an opportunity which the Fund will seek to exploit. Historically, there has been a lack of MLP ownership for many institutional investors. Because MLPs often generate unrelated business taxable income, tax-exempt investors such as pension plans, endowments, employee benefit plans, and individual retirement accounts have not traditionally been MLP investors. Because of the perceived tax-reporting burdens and complexities associated with MLP investments, MLPs have historically appealed only to certain retail investors. Chickasaw Capital Management believes that due to this limited focus, the market for MLPs can experience inefficiencies which we will seek to exploit.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund’s I Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s A Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s C Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The five-year rating for C Shares is based on extended performance, using historical adjusted returns prior to the inception date of the Class C shares (Class C inception was 3/31/14), and reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class (inception date for Class I and A was 2/17/11), adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of the Class C shares. These star ratings for all share classes were among Energy Limited Partnership Funds with 76 funds in the three year period and 34 funds in the five year period. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

You should consider the MainGate MLP Fund's ("Fund") investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus that contains this and other information, click here. To have a hardcopy prospectus mailed to you, call 855.MLP.FUND (855.657.3863).
The Fund is offered only to United States residents and information on this website is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is nondiversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund will invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) which concentrate investments in the natural resource sector and are subject to the risks of energy prices and demand and the volatility of commodity investments. Damage to facilities and infrastructure of MLPs may significantly affect the value of an investment and may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their business. MLPs are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment. Investments in smaller companies involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. MLPs are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including complex tax structure risks, limited ability for election or removal of management, limited voting rights, potential dependence on parent companies or sponsors for revenues to satisfy obligations, and potential conflicts of interest between partners, members and affiliates.
An investment in the Fund does not receive the same tax advantages as a direct investment in the MLP. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation or “C” corporation and is therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at rates applicable to corporations (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. MLP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result the MLP Fund’s after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. The potential tax benefits from investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Return of Capital: A return, by the Fund, of an investor's monies that is not considered income and therefore is not taxed because its amount does not exceed the original investment.

An Investment Process Focused on Risk
The Chickasaw Capital Management investment team starts with an energy point of view which influences our outlook on the relative attraction of various sectors of the MLP market. The current MLP investment universe is thoroughly analyzed in order to evaluate potential investment candidates.
Through our rigorous research efforts, Chickasaw Capital Management develops a clear profile of the risk and return characteristics of a given MLP. We seek to identify those factors that most strongly influence the MLP’s distributable cash flow, which is more important to us than earnings estimates. We then call upon those factors and our understanding of the particular MLP's management strategy and project portfolio to forecast future distributable cash flow estimates and anticipated growth rates. Business prospects, then valuation, are thoroughly assessed before our process ultimately yields viable candidates for closer consideration.
While many in the investment community may use statistical measures — such as standard deviation* — as proxies for risk, we define risk as the potential for any investment loss. Ultimately, we are interested in identifying possible influences and circumstances that could lead to loss. We seek to control risk by developing a diversified portfolio comprised of MLPs that collectively maintain a history of stable and growing cash flow, with exposure that is spread across geographic, business, capital structure and company management factors.
Chickasaw Capital Management's research and investment processes have evolved from our depth of experience and expertise. These qualities combine with our close, longstanding relationships with MLP management teams to help differentiate Chickasaw Capital Management as we strive to deliver competitive returns to our clients.
__________
*A statistical measure of the historical volatility of a mutual fund or portfolio, usually computed using 36 monthly returns.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.

It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.

The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund’s I Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s A Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The Fund’s C Shares received 3 stars over the three year period and 4 stars over the five year period. The five-year rating for C Shares is based on extended performance, using historical adjusted returns prior to the inception date of the Class C shares (Class C inception was 3/31/14), and reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class (inception date for Class I and A was 2/17/11), adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of the Class C shares. These star ratings for all share classes were among Energy Limited Partnership Funds with 76 funds in the three year period and 34 funds in the five year period.

How MainGate Handles Capital Gains




 














 



newswire


 











Experience...The Difference
Investing in energy Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) can provide an array of compelling characteristics...just look at the sector's performance compared to broader equity markets and other asset classes, its distribution record, and the liquidity and flexibility of public trading (see Figures MLP 1-3).
Now you can tap into the MLP asset class with the convenience of a mutual fund...1099 tax reporting, no K-1s or UBTI, and daily liquidity at NAV.
As you explore the opportunity to capitalize on the potential role that MLPs can play, we hope you will call upon the expertise of those who have been immersed in the sector from its earliest days. The portfolio managers of Chickasaw Capital Management — advisor of the MainGate MLP Fund — have spent an average of 22+ years within the MLP sector...we believe this makes us one of the most experienced MLP investment teams in the U.S.
Learn more about putting our experience and expertise to work for you and your clients.
Capital Gains
Due to the Fund’s "C" corporation tax structure, shareholders receive a 1099 DIV statement that reflects income received and Return of Capital associated with quarterly distributions for the year. There will be no capital gains reflected on the 1099.
Potential capital gain/loss activity from the Fund’s investment portfolio is handled at the Fund level and does not flow to the Fund shareholder via their 1099.

 

 

 



Individual Investors


 
   

 








For you — the Individual Investor — MLPs can have the ability to address a host of asset allocation needs.
Whether it is the potential for yield, the potential for hedging against inflation or the potential for a desired total return, the attributes that MLPs have historically displayed (see Figures MLP 1-3) can offer a compelling complement to one's portfolio.

Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.

The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.

MLPs are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment. Investments in smaller companies involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. MLPs are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including complex tax structure risks, limited ability for election or removal of management, limited voting rights, potential dependence on parent companies or sponsors for revenues to satisfy obligations, and potential conflicts of interest between partners, members and affiliates.
An investment in the Fund does not receive the same tax advantages as a direct investment in the MLP. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation or “C” corporation and is therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at rates applicable to corporations (currently at a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. MLP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result the MLP Fund’s after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. The potential tax benefits from investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
Return of Capital: A return, by the Fund, of an investor's monies that is not considered income and therefore is not taxed because its amount does not exceed the original investment.

our history


















1963

Our company was founded by Chick Saffell and based in southern California. In the beginning, the company name was Sport Service. It was formed from a conversation between two friends, Chick and the founder of the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), Wally Parks. The first merchandise line produced by our company was for the NHRA U.S. Nationals event located in Indianapolis in 1963. 2,000 t-shirts were produced with novelty items to compliment the assortment. All merchandise was sold out half way through the event weekend.









1985

The company continued to grow with the NHRA and a few other business partners, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It became apparent that we needed to be more centrally located to continue with the fulfillment of all our events. In 1985, Sport Service relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana.









2002

In late 2002, we changed our name from Sport Service to MainGate Inc. We started to change our leadership with the hiring of David Moroknek as Executive Vice President. Moroknek began to build a new team who shared a vision for growth.












2003 thru 2008

MainGate focused on diversification of partnerships and establishing a new mission to provide the best customer service in the industry and maximizing sales. Our goal is to have the Right Product at the Right Place at the Right Price and at the Right Time. With these changes, we continued to grow and at the end of each of these years, we closed our books with stating “this was the best year in our company’s history”. 









2009

A year where the economy hit many companies very hard, some closing doors and many downsizing to keep their doors open, we continued to grow. The key to our success in 2009 was adding new partnerships, providing the best customer service and staying loyal to the brands we represent. Despite the effects of the economy, we continued to invest in our business. We worked hard and did not lose sight of our goal to be The Premier Event Retail and Merchandising Company in the Country.









today

Today, MainGate is a privately held merchandise and marketing company as diverse as its clientele. We are not only the industry standard in event merchandising, but also a multifaceted merchandise company offering a wide-range of merchandise solutions to all our business partners. We are large enough to secure anything our customers need yet small enough to provide the customer service our partners deserve.

If you need additional financial guidance, investment professionals are available over the phone.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
*Other fees and commissions apply to a WellsTrade® account. For complete information on fees and commissions refer to the WellsTrade® Account Commissions and Fee Schedule on wellsfargo.com

Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites.

Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details.

When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime.
