Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Superstar Investors Webinar | December 13, 2016


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.

Can Value Timing Improve a Style Portfolio?

Just like asset classes, styles - or factors - can become cheaper or more expensive than average. In this webinar, Cliff Asness and Ronen Israel discuss whether this information can be used to build a better style portfolio, and compare value timing to strategic diversification for style investors.
