U.S. Chamber Board Elects Gerald L. Shaheen Chairman







Wednesday, June 7, 2006 - 8:00pm
WASHINGTON, D.C.—The United States Chamber of Commerce board of directors elected Gerald L. Shaheen, group president of Caterpillar, Inc., as its new chairman for 2006. Caterpillar Inc. is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines.
"Gerry is immensely admired in the business world," said Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue. "He will play a significant role in advancing the Chamber's goals and initiatives." 
During his term as chairman, Shaheen will focus on the steps the U.S. needs to take to remain globally competitive, including providing greater access to health care, improving the deteriorating education system, reducing lawsuits, and engaging in global trade and investment. 
"I believe that America's best days are ahead, but they won't come without constant change, flexibility, and innovation," Shaheen said. "American business is good at adapting, taking risks, and fighting for survival. We need to continue to do these things to keep our edge."  
Shaheen helped lead Caterpillar to a second consecutive year of record sales and profits in 2005.  Since joining Caterpillar in 1967, Shaheen has held numerous marketing and management positions both in the U.S. and Europe and at one time had responsibility for Caterpillar's business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union.  He was elected vice president of Caterpillar with responsibility for engine marketing and administration in 1995 and assumed his current position in 1998. 
A graduate of Bradley University, Shaheen serves as chairman of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. He is a board member of the Mineral Information Institute and Bradley University. He also serves on the Board of Directors for National City Corporation, where he chairs the Nominating and Board of Directors Governance Committee, and AGCO Corporation, where he chairs the Compensation Committee.  In Peoria, Mr. Shaheen serves on the OSF Saint Francis Medical Center Foundation Council, as well as on the Board of Trustees of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Greater Illinois Chapter, and Peoria NEXT.
The U.S. Chamber is the world's largest business federation representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region.

A director's stock index is an unweighted index of company stock performances while they sat on the board.
CEO pay includes salary, bonuses, stock sales, and other payments.
Average CEO Pay is calculated using the last year a director sat on the board of each company.
Stock returns do not include dividends.
