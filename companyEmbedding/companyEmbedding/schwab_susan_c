Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Ranks Highest in Full Service Investor Satisfaction for Second Consecutive Year


 






Costa Mesa, Calif.: 6 April 2017 — Emerging affluent investors—defined as Millennials1 with $100,000 in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of at-risk assets managed by full service financial advisors, according to the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study,SM released today. Surprisingly, half (48%) of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm, compared with just 8% among all other generations of investors. "Wealth managers have been slow to focus on Millennials because they don’t yet have the assets Boomers do, but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different," said Mike Foy, director of the wealth management practice at J.D. Power. "With the emergence of robo-advisors and self-directed platforms, investors have more options than ever, both within and outside the traditional full-service channel."The study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space. Noting distinct differences between Millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction, economic outlook, advisor and firm loyalty, and advocacy/referrals, this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer base.Following are some of the key generational findings in the study:Millennial money in motion: An alarming 48% of emerging affluent Millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next 12 months versus only 8% of other investors. While emerging affluent Millennials still represent just 8% of the overall available investable asset pool, they represent 55% of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firm.Evolving investor needs: Today, just 54% of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning, these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for Millennials (e.g., major purchase or education planning) or for Boomers who are leaving the work force (e.g., capital preservation or estate planning).Brave new world of referrals: The firms that are able to create loyalty among Millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards. Among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend, Millennials made more positive recommendations during the past 12 months (an average of 8.1 per client) than did Boomers (3.3 per client) and Gen X (3.7 per client) combined. But advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source: Millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked (40%) or they were incentivized to do so (39%).Risk of channel defection: One-fourth (25%) of full-service Millennial investors have either tried, or are actively using, a robo-advisor platform and 28% of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their full-service firm. Also, more than one-third (34%) have a secondary self-directed account, suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups. Study RankingsCharles Schwab & Co., Inc. (838) ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for a second consecutive year, followed by Fidelity Investments (835) and Edward Jones (833).The U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, now in its 15th year, measures overall investor satisfaction with full service investment firms in seven factors (in order of importance): financial advisor; investment performance; account information; product offerings; commissions and fees; website; and problem resolution. This year, overall investor satisfaction is up 15 points to 819 (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2016.The study was fielded in January 2017 and is based on responses from more than 6,500 investors who make some or all of their investment decisions with a financial advisor.For more information about the 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-full-service-investor-satisfaction-study.See the online press release at http://www.jdpower.com/pr-id/2017037.J.D.

7 Information about  Clients Speak™, Ratings and Reviews by Schwab clients
Ratings and reviews are submitted by clients voluntarily and are screened for acceptance in accordance with the Publishing Guidelines prior to publication. Please see the Publishing Guidelines for details regarding which reviews are published.
 The average rating scores are based on published reviews for the indicated account(s) and services and do not incorporate ratings and reviews that do not satisfy the Publishing Guidelines. Ratings and reviews are added continuously and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed. During the period from 1/1/2011 to 9/30/2013, 2,996 reviews were submitted, 2,386 were accepted, and 610 were not accepted for publication in accordance with the Publishing Guidelines. Sorting of reviews by “Featured Reviews” first shows reviews selected by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and Schwab Bank based on subjective criteria deemed relevant at the time of selection including marketing priorities.
 Ratings and opinions expressed by clients are not meant to suggest future performance or the suitability of any account type, product, or service for any particular client and may not be representative of the experience of other clients. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and Schwab Bank cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information included in client reviews.

Career[edit]
Prior to becoming Deputy Trade Representative, she had served since 2003 as President and CEO of the University System of Maryland Foundation. From 1995 to 2003, she served as Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she remains on the faculty.[1] Earlier in her career, she served as an aide to then-U.S. Senator John Danforth, as a foreign service officer in the State Department, as a well-respected Director-General of the Foreign and Commercial Service within the U.S. Department of Commerce, and as a business development executive at Motorola. Her first job was a trade negotiator with the USTR office, and she later served as Trade Policy Officer in the US Embassy in Tokyo.
She negotiated the United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute by signing a deal along with Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson on September 12, 2006 that gave Canada 4 out of the 5.3 billion dollars that the country lost in the dispute.[2]
On January 13, 2009, as the Bush Administration neared its end, Schwab reportedly announced retaliatory tariffs on "dozens" of European luxury items, including French truffles, Irish oatmeal, Italian sparkling water and Roquefort cheese. The European ban on U.S. beef containing hormones was the reason cited by the US for the retaliatory action. Roquefort cheese, made from sheep's milk in a region of southern France, was hit with a 300% tariff, apparently the highest level by far of any in the package. When a 100% tariff was placed on the cheese in 1999, the report says, José Bové helped marshal opposition. As of 2009, the French complaint with the Roquefort tariff is being pursued through diplomatic channels.[3] She helped to launch negotiations for ACTA.[4]
Board of directors member[edit]
On June 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation elected Ambassador Schwab as a director. The Board also appointed Ambassador Schwab as a member of its Compensation Committee. She also sits on the Board of Directors at Boeing and Caterpillar Inc.
Personal information[edit]
Schwab is a resident of Annapolis, Maryland. She attended Williams College (BA) in Political Economy, Stanford University (MA) in Development Policy and George Washington University (Ph.D) in Public Administration and International Business. She is a 1972 graduate of International School Bangkok.
On November 20, 2006, Schwab's husband, Curtis Carroll, died.[citation needed]

Susan Carol Schwab (born March 23, 1955) is an American politician, who served as United States Trade Representative from June, 2006 to January, 2009.
She was nominated to replace Rob Portman as United States Trade Representative in April, 2006, becoming Acting Trade Representative upon Portman's confirmation as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Previously, she served as Deputy United States Trade Representative from 2005 to 2006.

Career[edit]
Prior to becoming Deputy Trade Representative, she had served since 2003 as President and CEO of the University System of Maryland Foundation. From 1995 to 2003, she served as Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she remains on the faculty.[1] Earlier in her career, she served as an aide to then-U.S. Senator John Danforth, as a foreign service officer in the State Department, as a well-respected Director-General of the Foreign and Commercial Service within the U.S. Department of Commerce, and as a business development executive at Motorola. Her first job was a trade negotiator with the USTR office, and she later served as Trade Policy Officer in the US Embassy in Tokyo.
She negotiated the United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute by signing a deal along with Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson on September 12, 2006 that gave Canada 4 out of the 5.3 billion dollars that the country lost in the dispute.[2]
On January 13, 2009, as the Bush Administration neared its end, Schwab reportedly announced retaliatory tariffs on "dozens" of European luxury items, including French truffles, Irish oatmeal, Italian sparkling water and Roquefort cheese. The European ban on U.S. beef containing hormones was the reason cited by the US for the retaliatory action. Roquefort cheese, made from sheep's milk in a region of southern France, was hit with a 300% tariff, apparently the highest level by far of any in the package. When a 100% tariff was placed on the cheese in 1999, the report says, José Bové helped marshal opposition. As of 2009, the French complaint with the Roquefort tariff is being pursued through diplomatic channels.[3] She helped to launch negotiations for ACTA.[4]
Board of directors member[edit]
On June 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation elected Ambassador Schwab as a director. The Board also appointed Ambassador Schwab as a member of its Compensation Committee. She also sits on the Board of Directors at Boeing and Caterpillar Inc.
Personal information[edit]
Schwab is a resident of Annapolis, Maryland. She attended Williams College (BA) in Political Economy, Stanford University (MA) in Development Policy and George Washington University (Ph.D) in Public Administration and International Business. She is a 1972 graduate of International School Bangkok.
On November 20, 2006, Schwab's husband, Curtis Carroll, died.[citation needed]

  Ambassador Susan SchwabUnited States Trade Representative

www.ustr.gov




Ambassador Susan C. Schwab was nominated to be United States Trade Representative by President George W. Bush on April 18, 2006, and was confirmed as USTR by the United States Senate on June 8, 2006.  As USTR, Ambassador Schwab is a member of the President's Cabinet and serves as the President’s principal trade advisor, negotiator, and spokesperson on trade issues.  
Prior to her appointment as USTR, Ambassador Schwab served as Deputy USTR with a portfolio overseeing U.S. trade relations with Europe and Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Americas.  In addition she is responsible for USTR operations involving the WTO and multilateral affairs; services and investment; intellectual property; industry, market access and telecommunications; and intergovernmental affairs and public liaison activities.  Since her arrival at USTR, Ambassador Schwab has been actively engaged in the development of U.S. strategy in the Doha Round multilateral trade negotiations, and successfully concluded bilateral free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South Korea. 
Ambassador Schwab served as Dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy from 1995 through 2003.  Immediately before joining the Administration, she held the position of President and CEO of the University System of Maryland (USM) Foundation and USM Vice Chancellor for Advancement.  Schwab came to the University of Maryland from Motorola, Inc., where she served as Director of Corporate Business Development, and where she was engaged in strategic planning and negotiation on behalf of the company in China and elsewhere in Asia.  Prior to that appointment she was Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service during the Administration of George H.W. Bush.
 Schwab spent most of the 1980s as a trade policy specialist and then legislative director for Senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), playing a major role in numerous U.S. trade policy initiatives, including landmark trade legislation that Congress enacted in 1984 and 1988.  Previously, Schwab served as a Trade Policy Officer in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.  Her first job was as an agricultural trade negotiator in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.   
Ambassador Schwab is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). She previously served on the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Board of Trustees of the Council for Excellence in Government and the National Selection Committee for the Innovations in American Government Awards program. She holds a B.A. in Political Economy from Williams College, a Masters in Development Policy from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Public Administration and International Business from The George Washington University. 
Ambassador Schwab has published articles and a book on U.S. trade policy and legislation (“Trade-Offs: Negotiating the Omnibus Trade Act,” Harvard Business School Press, 1994), as well as articles on U.S.–Japan trade relations, trade politics, and public policy education. 
In addition to the time she has spent working overseas, Ambassador Schwab is the product of a Foreign Service family and grew up in Africa, Europe and Asia. She currently resides in Annapolis, Maryland.

Ambassador Susan C. Schwab

United States Trade Representative
Biography












November 6, 2007





Susan C. Schwab
Good afternoon, this is an exciting time in trade policy.  There are few issues as important to our nations economic health and security.  And yet, there are few issues as misunderstood.  I hope todays discussion sheds some light on both aspects of trade.

FIRAS, from CALIFORNIA  writes: How will this free trade agreement benefit America the most? Why are
only 
these countries listed on the free trade agreement? Keep up the good
work 
Susan C. SchwabThank you! The pending agreements will give American farmers, manufacturers, workers, and service providers access to growing markets.  For years we have imported nearly all products from Peru, Colombia, and Panama duty-free.  Finally, our producers will have the same access to their markets.  

When you consider that the population of the three Latin American countries is over 76 million people and Korea has another 48 million, it is easy to see that these are pretty significant commercial opportunities.  In fact, the U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that the Korea agreement will add from $10.1 to $11.9 billion per year to our GDP through enhanced trade in goods alone - not to mention the enhanced export opportunities the FTA will afford U.S. service providers, or savings it stands to provide to U.S. consumers.

In addition to these compelling commercial considerations, these agreements will strengthen strategic alliances with critical allies.  

The United States had free trade agreements in force with 3 countries before the Bush Administration, and now we have agreements in place with 14 countries. Only three were in place when we came into office.  That is unprecedented number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).  Under President Bushs leadership, America has been hard at work opening markets for the products and services Americans produce so well.  We are always looking for new opportunities.  However, not all countries are ready for the comprehensive approach we take to the FTAs.  These agreements must truly level the playing field.  They are complex and significant undertakings and they have to be done right.
Debbie, from Texas  writes: Question 1. What do say to those that say NAFTA is the cause of the
invasion of 
mexican nationals crossing our borders illegally leaving behind their 
families to seek employment? 

Question 2. And what do you say to the millions Americans that lost
their 
outsource jobs to cheap(er) labor? 

 Question 3. Because of the skyrocket home closures, do you agree just
maybe 
that free trade is not a good idea at this time for our Country? 
Susan C. SchwabDebbie, Im glad you asked these questions because there are a lot of misperceptions out there about trade.  NAFTA has actually resulted in economic opportunities on both sides of the border.  In the dozen years since NAFTA, U.S. economic growth has been higher and unemployment is lower than in the dozen years before NAFTA.  Even our manufacturing output has gone up.  Economic change is a permanent part of modern economic life and the transformation can cause dislocations.  However, immigration from Mexico as a policy issue pre-date NAFTA but you can pretty certain that without NAFTA and the opportunities it has created on both sides of the border, the illegal immigration picture would have looked worse.  You simply need to be careful not to blame trade for other things going on in the economy.  In fact, the best estimates we have is that trade accounts for two, maybe three percent of annual job losses.  The vast majority of dislocations results from increases in productivity, changes in consumer preferences, competition among U.S. companies here at home, and even the weather.  When trade does result in job losses, however, we must assist the communities and individuals involved.  President Bush has emphasized this with support for a better Trade Adjustment Assistance program.    But we should not be trying to help those adversely affected by trade in ways that hurts the vast majority of Americans who benefit from trade.

What we have to remember is that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.9 percent this year third quarter, with export expansion accounting for almost half of that growth.  Unemployment is also at a low 4.7 percent.  Overall, we have created over 8 million jobs in the last four years.   We have seen that exports have made an important contribution to this economic growth.  With the problems in the housing market and gas prices on the rise again, restricting one source of our growth would be precisely the wrong thing to do at this time.

John, from TX  writes: Lately it seems like Free Trade means giving away our industries, jobs
and 
trade secrets away for free to our competitors. Why can't we have "Fair 
Trade" where we get something back of equal value? Now it just serves as
a way 
for our industries to export environemntal problems and workers rights 
abuses to other countries in the name of corporate profits.  Of course
we'd 
like to open up US markets to developing countries so they can become 
self-sufficient but our trade with China and oil-producing countries 
seems to be in the long-term self-destructive, especially since we don't
produce anything anymore that people can't get elsewhere cheaper. Now 
places like Dubai and China own us like a colony where they get to
exploit our 
resources. 
Susan C. SchwabAs I noted earlier, the four trade agreements before the Congress open new markets for U.S. exports that already have virtually unlimited access to our market.  Free trade must be fair trade and the benefits of trade must be broadly shared.  These principles help shape our countrys trade policy.  The free trade agreements have concluded now have enforceable provisions to safeguard labor rights and environmental protections.  Instead of the U.S. exporting bad practices, U.S. companies operating closer to emerging export markets often bring with them high standards that are emulated in other countries.  It is hard to see how workers or the environment in developing countries will be any better off without these trade agreements.  The FTAs are the best leverage we have to raise standards.

Similarly, our trade relationship with China has allowed us to encourage Chinas adoption of market-oriented economic reforms.  The U.S. worked closely to bring China into the rules-based trading system and China has changed literally thousands of laws to meet its World Trade Organization obligations.  We still have a long way to go and we continue to use all the tools we have to ensure China plays by the rules  including bringing legal cases before the WTO, four of which are currently pending.  What we cannot do is deny American families and business the goods and services they need.  Closing our market to trade and investment from other countries will only impede job creation.  Foreign direct investment employs some five million Americans directly and exports expand opportunities to create additional, well-paying jobs.  We need to keep goods and capital flowing both ways for fair and mutual benefit. 

I would add, however, that the United States has the worlds largest production of manufactured products and, further that U.S. production of manufactures over the last 10 years (1996-2006) has grown (38.5%) slightly fast than the overall U.S. economic (37.1%.).  Overall job loss in manufacturing reflects to a significant degree the high rates of worker productivity growth achieved in that sector in recent years.
Kim, from Kentucky  writes: Hi Susan,  What exactly is a trade agreement supposed to accomplish and
why 
were these countries chosen? Thank You 
Susan C. SchwabHere is why trade is so important economically.  For the American economy to grow - for us to be able to create good jobs - we need to open new markets.  The best way to do that is with free trade agreements.  

Congress is set to vote on a free trade agreement with Peru this week.  Agreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea are right behind Peru.  The United States has long been open to the goods and services from these countries.  Now we have a chance to open their markets to our goods and services.  

These four countries have stated their eagerness to forge deeper and stronger trade ties with us.  Our response must be to grasp their extended hands.  We know there are leaders around the world who do not share our values of economic and political freedom.  We will accomplish a lot by establishing stronger relationships with countries that share our vision and in providing their people an alternative path to economic development and political stability.

hernan, from Lima - Peru writes: Dear Ambassador Susan C. Schwab:  In the trade agrement between the
United 
States and Peru, I would like to know what improvement will bring this
trade 
agreement to peruvian workers and american workers, because in your 
country you have higher salaries than Peru. And in your country you have
an 
equal opportunity employer way of recruiting employees and worker in
most 
companies, very different of my country Peru. 

Thank You very much for your sincerity.
Susan C. SchwabDear Mr. Herrera, the U.S. Peru Trade Promotion Agreement will lock in Perus preferential access to the U.S. market on a permanent basis.  This will create a more consistent, predictable economic relationship than conditional trade preferences, and will generate new trade and investment flows.  More than that, the agreement will encourage more transparency in Perus legal and commercial systems, stronger protections for intellectual property rights, and better access to American services. This will help Peru continue to modernize and grow its economy.  Together, these changes will help Peru attract more foreign direct investment, create quality jobs and make it easier for Perus own entrepreneurs to operate successfully.
Cliff, from Brimfield, Ohio
 writes: Ambassador Schwab: You always read about the trade with China, But just
how 
much trade do we do with Peru, Colombia(only thing you hear about them
is 
drugs) Panama and South Korea? Thank You 
Susan C. SchwabThere is detailed information on the USTR website, www.ustr.gov, but here are some basic facts.  Our two-way trade with Peru has doubled in the last three years to $8.8 billion.  Two-way trade with Colombia has reached $16 billion and $3 billion with Panama.  Korea is our seventh largest goods trading partner with two-way trade totaling $78 billion a year.   Together, these four countries represent 124 million potential consumers for our exports of food, manufactured products, and services.

Thanks in part to trade initiatives in the 1990s, which were aimed at encouraging people to move into the licit, formal economy, drug trafficking and the violence associated with it in Latin America have been greatly reduced.  Members of Congress who have visited Colombia with Administration officials in recent months have discovered a different country than the one that had dominated their perceptions.  Medellin for example, once known for its high level of violence, is now a city where families are thriving in peace.   The leaders and the people of Peru and Colombia have courageously made great strides in establishing peace and stability and are looking to the United States to support those efforts with deeper and stronger trade relationships.

Tarik, from springfield,IL  writes: Why is free trade good for America? Why is our current trade defict not
a 
worry for this administration? We import more than we export so free
trade 
benefits everyone else more than us. Why is that a good strategy? 
Susan C. SchwabFrom an economic standpoint, trade is good for the economy in two ways.  

One, imports allow families to more easily purchase what they want and need, whether it is shoes for the kids or the latest high-tech gadget.  Imports also allow businesses to obtain the parts and inputs they need at prices to allow them to stay competitive in the international marketplace.  Competition also requires Americans to be more efficient, to become productive, and to concentrate in areas where we have competitive advantages over most other countries.  More and more, our advantage is in the high-skill, high-wage jobs of cutting-edge industries and services.  This free-trade formula has worked to create an economic system that is the envy of most of the world.  

Two, trade benefits America because it allows us to send the food we grow, the products we make, and the services we provide to the rest of the world.  Ninety five percent of the worlds consumers live outside our borders.  To stay prosperous we need to reach them.  We cannot build a sustainable economic future by only buying and selling from each other at home.   Recently, for example, trade has contributed significantly to our economic growth, with exports generating some 40 percent of our GDP growth in the past four quarters.

The best way to bring down the trade deficit is to expand exports not to restrict imports.  And, in fact this year U.S. exports have increased so much faster than imports that our trade deficit has actually been declining.  If we want more balance in our trade relationships, our trading partners must grow faster and purchase more of what we produce.  Most countries recognize that the path to economic growth is to embrace the market principles that have worked so well for us.  As other countries prosper from commerce, we should see ever expanding opportunities for the United States.  One final thought about trade deficits is that we have often enjoyed trade surpluses, but mainly during recessions!  The trade deficit, while large, is also a sign of our prosperity, strong consumer demand, and a high standard of living.
Matt, from University of Miami
 writes: Madam Ambassador,  Thank you for serving President Bush and our country,
we 
all appreciate your efforts. How do you usually respond to people out
there 
who stand against free trade and don't see how crucial it is to support
such 
agreements? 

Thank you for taking my question, and God Bless America.
Susan C. SchwabBy speaking the truth.  Trade is easy to demagogue.  That is because its occasional negative effects, though small overall, are often concentrated while its broad benefits are spread so widely in the economy.  Trade gets the blame for all economic ills and is the source of all of our economic anxiety.   Todays pace of economic change can be unsettling and critics of trade often pander to peoples fear rather than stirring their hopes.  All we can do is to explain that trade helped create prosperity at home and stoked development overseas and warn of the perils of retrenching economically.  The President has used high-level platforms, such as the United Nations, to emphasize how important trade is to the promotion of freedom and economic opportunity around the world.  Along with my administration colleagues, I devote a lot of time to meeting with stakeholders from agriculture, industry, services, and other groups to lay out the compelling facts about the benefits of trade.  We give speeches, author articles, and opinion pieces in the news media.  Supporters of trade need to engage in the debate as well and not be complacent as skepticism about trade continues to be on the rise.  We also spend a lot of time talking to members of Congress from both major political parties, listening to their concerns, and responding to their suggestions to make the global trading system work better for all.  Yes, we do need to help the limited number of individuals and communities that are impacted by trade  but we need to do so in ways that does not jeopardize the significant gains that trade produces for the vast majority of Americans.




Susan C. Schwab
It has been a pleasure to explain how trade benefits our economy and enhances our strategic and security interests.  We are fortunate that more and more countries are eager to use trade to boost their peace, freedom, and prosperity.  We should welcome every chance to deepen and strengthen our commercial ties with them.  Thank you.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts. The Schwab One brokerage account has no minimum balance requirements, and there is no requirement to fund this account, when it is opened with a linked High Yield Investor Checking account.

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Ranks Highest in Full Service Investor Satisfaction for Second Consecutive Year


 






Costa Mesa, Calif.: 6 April 2017 — Emerging affluent investors—defined as Millennials1 with $100,000 in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of at-risk assets managed by full service financial advisors, according to the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study,SM released today. Surprisingly, half (48%) of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm, compared with just 8% among all other generations of investors. "Wealth managers have been slow to focus on Millennials because they don’t yet have the assets Boomers do, but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different," said Mike Foy, director of the wealth management practice at J.D. Power. "With the emergence of robo-advisors and self-directed platforms, investors have more options than ever, both within and outside the traditional full-service channel."The study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space. Noting distinct differences between Millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction, economic outlook, advisor and firm loyalty, and advocacy/referrals, this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer base.Following are some of the key generational findings in the study:Millennial money in motion: An alarming 48% of emerging affluent Millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next 12 months versus only 8% of other investors. While emerging affluent Millennials still represent just 8% of the overall available investable asset pool, they represent 55% of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firm.Evolving investor needs: Today, just 54% of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning, these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for Millennials (e.g., major purchase or education planning) or for Boomers who are leaving the work force (e.g., capital preservation or estate planning).Brave new world of referrals: The firms that are able to create loyalty among Millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards. Among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend, Millennials made more positive recommendations during the past 12 months (an average of 8.1 per client) than did Boomers (3.3 per client) and Gen X (3.7 per client) combined. But advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source: Millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked (40%) or they were incentivized to do so (39%).Risk of channel defection: One-fourth (25%) of full-service Millennial investors have either tried, or are actively using, a robo-advisor platform and 28% of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their full-service firm. Also, more than one-third (34%) have a secondary self-directed account, suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups. Study RankingsCharles Schwab & Co., Inc. (838) ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for a second consecutive year, followed by Fidelity Investments (835) and Edward Jones (833).The U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, now in its 15th year, measures overall investor satisfaction with full service investment firms in seven factors (in order of importance): financial advisor; investment performance; account information; product offerings; commissions and fees; website; and problem resolution. This year, overall investor satisfaction is up 15 points to 819 (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2016.The study was fielded in January 2017 and is based on responses from more than 6,500 investors who make some or all of their investment decisions with a financial advisor.For more information about the 2017 U.S. Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-full-service-investor-satisfaction-study.See the online press release at http://www.jdpower.com/pr-id/2017037.J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
