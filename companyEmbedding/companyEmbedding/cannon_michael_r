      Address: Solectron Corporation, 847 Gibraltar Drive, Milpitas, California
      95035; http://www.solectron.com.
    

      ■ In January 2003 Michael Cannon was named president and chief
      executive officer of Solectron Corporation, the electronics-manufacturing
      and supply-chain services provider, bringing with him over 25 years of
      manufacturing and operations experience. As president and CEO of Maxtor
      Corporation he had turned around flagging revenues and built the company
      into an industry leader. Analysts and colleagues alike expressed
      confidence in Cannon's leadership abilities and strategic skills,
      with which he would enhance Solectron's market share and
      profitability.
    

      BUILDING EXPERIENCE IN THE DATA-STORAGE INDUSTRY
    

      After earning a degree in mechanical engineering from Michigan State
      University, Cannon was hired by Boeing Company, where he worked as an
      engineer and eventually as a manager in the manufacturing research and
      development group. After nine years with Boeing, Cannon began his career
      in the data-storage industry when he was hired by Control Data Corporation
      (CDC). Cannon spent the next 10 years with CDC and its spin-off Imprimis
      Technology in a number of senior management positions, gaining exposure to
      the technology-components and disk-drive operations areas. He also logged
      relevant experience in Asian manufacturing, spending four years in
      Singapore as vice president of Far East operations.
    

      In 1993 Cannon joined IBM's Storage Systems Division and over the
      next three years held various senior management positions, including vice
      president of worldwide manufacturing, vice president of the Personal
      Storage Systems Division, and vice president of product design. His work
      again took him to the Far East, where he established manufacturing sites
      in Singapore, Thailand, and China, as well as in Hungary. Cannon left a
      positive mark on IBM's hard-drive business, returning the
      struggling unit to profitability.
    

      TURNAROUND AT MAXTOR
    

      Cannon was brought on as Maxtor's president and chief executive
      officer in July 1996. In 
      
        VARbusiness
      
       he said of his decision to take the helm of the troubled company, which
      had been unprofitable for several years, "I was attracted to the
      turnaround situation and saw tremendous growth opportunity for the
      company" (January 19, 1998). Cannon planned to cut costs, introduce
      efficiencies in manufacturing operations, focus on higher-profit desktop
      drives, and more quickly bring products to the marketplace. He expected
      employees to consider themselves accountable for the company's
      performance. Mark Geenan, the president of the consulting company Trend
      Focus, said of Cannon in 
      
        VARbusiness
      
      , "He pushes people to be on schedule, and everything in the
      company has sped up. Cannon peeled away businesses that didn't make
      sense and returned to core competencies" (January 19, 1998).
    

      During Cannon's tenure Maxtor made dramatic improvements in spite
      of a general downturn in the industry. The company's revenues
      increased significantly, and its base of businesses became more
      diversified by virtue of internal growth and acquisitions. In 2001 Cannon
      arranged a merger between Maxtor and the disk-drive maker Quantum
      Corporation, creating the world's largest disk-drive company in a
      deal worth an estimated $2.3 billion.
    

      TAKING THE HELM AT SOLECTRON
    

      In 2003 Cannon replaced Koichi Nishimura as Solectron's president
      and CEO. From the outset he faced challenging issues: a slump in the
      electronics manufacturing services industry in the early 2000s had had a
      serious impact on the company, which suffered several consecutive years of
      losses. Early on Cannon laid out his recovery plans, which included
      streamlining operations, cutting expenses, and exploring alternate revenue
      opportunities.
    

      Financial analysts were generally pleased with Cannon's
      appointment, describing his candor about the company's financial
      and organizational problems as refreshing. John Mc-Manus, the analyst at
      Needham & Company, told 
      
        EBN
      
      , "he recognizes what he has to do, which is the good news"
      (May 5, 2003). The IDC analyst Kevin Kane remarked in 
      
        EBN
      
      , "Cannon has experience in manufacturing operations, specifically
      in a low-margin, highly competitive business that can't afford
      inefficiency" (January 13, 2003). Colleagues soon appreciated the
      assertive actions that Cannon took in order to meet his goals for the
      company as well as his open line of communication with Solectron clients
      and employees around the world.
    

      William Hasler, Solectron's chairman of the board, had only
      positive things to say about Cannon to America's Intelligence Wire.
      Hasler referred to him as "an individual who truly knows technology
      and manufacturing. Mike has broad manufacturing and operations experience
      and has demonstrated a deep-rooted customer-service mindset. Mike has
      firsthand knowledge of both the challenges and opportunities that
      Solectron faces, and he is a seasoned and successful veteran of the
      hard-disk-drive business." Regarding Cannon's management
      style, Hasler said, "We are confident that Mike possesses the
      strategic skills and leadership abilities needed to accelerate
      Solectron's business and complete the company's return to
      industry-leading profitability and drive the business through a new phase
      of growth and development. He is a dynamic leader. Mike has the personal
      force to build on the great things Ko Nishimura has done for the company
      and make his own mark" (January 7, 2003).
    

      In Cannon's first year with the company, Solectron was the
      recipient of numerous accolades, including Teradata's Supplier
      Excellence Award, Cisco System's Transformation and Integration
      Supplier of the Year, Brocade's Supplier of the Year Award for
      Customer Focus, and Sun Microsystem's Meritorious Supplier
      Performance Award for Electronics Manufacturing. Solectron closed its
      third quarter of fiscal 2004 with sales of $3.04 billion, up 29 percent
      from the prior year.
    

      In addition to serving on Solectron's board of directors and
      remaining on the board at Maxtor, Cannon was a director for the Silicon
      Valley Manufacturing Group and Adobe Systems.
