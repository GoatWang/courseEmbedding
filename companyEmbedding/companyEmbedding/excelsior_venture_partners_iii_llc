SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Excelsior is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware and is a business development company as defined in Section 202(a)(22) of the Advisers Act (“BDC”). Excelsior has an effective registration statement on Form N-2 on file with the SEC. The investment objective of Excelsior is to seek long-term capital appreciation by primarily investing in private domestic companies in which the equity is closely held by company founders, management or a limited number of institutional investors. Excelsior also intends to invest, to a lesser extent, in domestic and international venture capital, buyout and other private equity funds managed by third parties, negotiated private investments in public companies and foreign companies in which the equity is closely held by company founders, management or a limited number of institutional investors. The foregoing investments are referred to collectively herein as “Direct Investments.” 
2. U.S. Trust Company, N.A. Asset Management Division is a separately identified division of U.S. Trust Company, N.A., a national bank organized under the laws of the United States. U.S. Trust Company, N.A. Asset Management Division serves as Excelsior's investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with Excelsior. U.S. Trust—New York Fund Asset Management Division is a separately identified division of United States Trust Company of New York, a state chartered bank and trust company. U.S. Trust—New York Fund Asset Management Division serves as the investment sub-adviser to Excelsior pursuant to an investment sub-advisory agreement among the Investment Sub-Adviser, the Investment Adviser and Excelsior. U.S. Trust Company, N.A. and United States Trust Company of New York are wholly-owned subsidiaries of U.S. Trust Corporation, a registered bank holding company. U.S. Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively herein as “U.S. Trust.” [1] 
           Under the supervision of Excelsior's board of managers (the “Board of Managers”), the Investment Adviser and Investment Sub-Advisers are responsible for finding, evaluating, structuring and monitoring Excelsior's investments and for providing or arranging for management and administrative services for Excelsior. The Investment Adviser and the Investment Sub-Adviser are each registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. 
3. Pursuant to Excelsior's Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), the business and affairs of Excelsior are managed under the direction of its Board of Managers. The Board of Managers consists of four persons and, as required by Section 56(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, three of the managers are not “interested persons” of Excelsior within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of such Act. 
4. Excelsior's members consist of individual and institutional investors and one registered investment company which functions as a feeder fund, Excelsior Venture Investors III, LLC (the “Feeder Fund”). Investors with accounts established at U.S. Trust hold approximately 92% of the units of membership interest in Excelsior and approximately 97% of the units in the Feeder Fund. Most other members of Start Printed Page 12875Excelsior and the Feeder Fund are investors with accounts at Charles Schwab and Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer and an affiliate of U.S. Trust Corporation. Each member of Excelsior other than the Feeder Fund met certain requirements, including that such investor's net assets were valued at $1,000,000 or more, and that the amount subscribed for did not exceed 10% of such investor's net assets. The Feeder Fund holds approximately 63.48% of the net assets of Excelsior. Each member of the Feeder Fund met certain requirements, including that such investor's net assets were valued at $500,000 or more, and that the amount subscribed for did not exceed 10% of such investor's net assets. 
5. The Operating Agreement provides that items of income, gain, loss, deduction and expense of Excelsior will be determined and allocated as of the end of each tax year (typically December 31) to reflect the economic interests of its members and the Investment Adviser. Capital gains are allocated first to the Investment Adviser until the cumulative amount of all gains allocated to the Investment Adviser from the commencement of operations equals the Incentive Carried Interest calculated through the end of the period for which the allocation is being made.[2] 
           The Investment Adviser will distribute a portion of the Incentive Carried Interest to the Investment Sub-Adviser. All remaining items of income, gain, loss, deduction and expense are allocated to Excelsior members pro rata in accordance with their capital investments. 
6. The Operating Agreement provides for the distribution of all cash and other property, including an in-kind distribution of securities, received by Excelsior that the Board of Managers does not expect to use in the operation of Excelsior's business. The Investment Adviser generally will be entitled to a distribution equal to the Incentive Carried Interest. Excelsior's members generally will be entitled to all amounts remaining for distribution pro rata in accordance with their capital investments. 
7. The Operating Agreement provides that (i) Any property that is distributed in kind to one or more members shall be deemed to have been sold for cash equal to its fair market value, (ii) the unrealized gain or loss inherent in such property shall be treated as recognized gain or loss for purposes of determining profits and losses, (iii) such gain or loss shall be allocated pursuant to the Operating Agreement, and (iv) such in-kind distribution shall be made after giving effect to such allocation. To date, however, no in-kind distributions have been made by Excelsior. 
8. Excelsior's Board of Managers will declare an in-kind distribution when it determines that such distribution is in the best interests of Excelsior and its members. Each member will be allocated securities distributed in kind in proportion to the member's ownership interest in Excelsior. Cash will be distributed in lieu of fractional share interests. 
9. Securities distributed in kind by Excelsior in conjunction with this Application will be listed on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ Stock Market and will not be subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale. These securities will be valued at the average of the closing bid and ask price, or in the case of exchange traded securities the closing price, of the five days immediately preceding the distribution. Market liquidity will be an important factor in declaring distributions and Excelsior will not distribute securities at any one time in an amount that is more than 5% of the outstanding shares of an issuer. In those relatively infrequent situations when this restriction does not permit all of Excelsior's holdings of an issuer to be distributed at one time, Applicants will closely monitor the market prior to any subsequent distribution to assure that the prior distribution is no longer significantly impacting the price of the securities. Excelsior's Board of Managers will, in acting upon each proposed distribution, consider whether a distribution of cash proceeds from a sale of securities would be of greater benefit to its members, including the Feeder Fund, than a distribution of the securities in more than one distribution, as described above. 
10. At the time Excelsior's Board of Managers declares an in-kind distribution, the Feeder Fund's Board of Managers will simultaneously declare an in-kind distribution having the same record date and distribution date to its members. From the securities allocated to the Feeder Fund, Feeder Fund members will be entitled to receive shares, and cash-in-lieu of fractional share interests, in proportion to their interests in the Feeder Fund. The Feeder Fund will notify Excelsior of the number of shares to be distributed and the amount of cash-in-lieu payments to be made to each Feeder Fund member and will instruct Excelsior to make a distribution directly to Feeder Fund members as of the distribution date. The Applicants will provide notice to Excelsior and Feeder Fund members of the in-kind distribution and will facilitate obtaining members' brokerage instructions or establishing a brokerage account for the receipt of the securities distributed in kind. Any cash-in-lieu payment for fractional securities will be made within five business days of the distribution date to all Excelsior members and Feeder Fund members. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act prohibits any investment adviser, unless exempt from registration pursuant to section 203(b), from entering into a contract that provides for compensation based upon “a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client,” commonly referred to as a “performance fee.” 
2. Section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act excepts from the performance fee prohibition of section 205(a)(1) a contract between an investment adviser and a BDC that provides for compensation not in excess of “20 per centum of the realized capital gains upon the funds of the [BDC] over a specified period or as of definite dates, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation.” Applicants assert that section 205(b)(3) recognizes the appropriateness of a performance fee as compensation for advisers' activities in light of the special nature of BDCs. 
3. Section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act, however, permits a performance fee only with respect to realized capital gains and does not contemplate the procedures set forth in the Operating Agreement whereby unrealized gains or losses will be deemed to be realized under certain conditions for purposes of calculating the Incentive Carried Interest. Excelsior's performance fee is prohibited by section 205(a)(1) and does not fall within the exception set out in section 205(b)(3). 
4. Section 206A of the Advisers Act authorizes the SEC by order upon application to conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person or Start Printed Page 12876transaction, or any class or classes of persons, or transactions, from any provision of the Advisers Act “if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Advisers Act].” 
5. Applicants request that the SEC grant an exemption from section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act to permit Excelsior to deem realized any unrealized gains or losses attributable to securities distributed in kind to its members for purposes of payment of the performance fee to the Investment Adviser and Investment Sub-Adviser. 
6. Applicants assert that their exemption from section 205(a)(1) is consistent with the standards of section 206A regarding investor protection and the purposes of the Advisers Act. Applicants argue that Congress has already found it appropriate to permit a performance fee in the case of an investment adviser to a BDC. Applicants argue further that, to the extent that section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act requires such a fee to be based on net realized capital gains, Applicants' proposal is consistent with the statutory purposes. Once the in-kind distribution is made, Excelsior's members and the members of the Feeder Fund will have the exclusive ability to liquidate such investments and realize any gains or losses. Applicants also assert that there should be no concern over the proper valuation of the securities upon which the fee is based, because Applicants are requesting exemptive relief only with respect to in-kind distributions of securities for which a trading market exists on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
7. Applicants state that they believe that it is in the best interests of the members of Excelsior and the members of the Feeder Fund, and in the public interest, for Excelsior to make in-kind distributions of securities. Applicants state that they believe that an in-kind distribution would enable Excelsior's members and the members of the Feeder Fund to maximize their investment. First, Applicants state that the alternative to an in-kind distribution is the sale of the securities and argue that such sales may have a negative effect on the price of the shares in the market. Second, Applicants represent that the securities to be distributed will be freely transferable and will not be subject to either legal or contractual restrictions on their sale. Moreover, Applicants represent that a distribution of securities will not constitute a taxable event with respect to Excelsior, its members, and members of the Feeder Fund, so that the members of Excelsior and the Feeder Fund will, in determining whether to hold or sell the securities, control the timing of realization of capital gains or losses. Finally, Applicants assert that as a venture capital fund, Excelsior and its advisers have not held themselves out as having experience with respect to publicly traded securities, and therefore its members do not lose any benefit of management expertise by receiving an in-kind distribution of securities.
Conditions
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. The relief will only apply to the distribution in kind by Excelsior of securities that are traded on a national securities exchange or on the NASDAQ Stock Market and are subject to no legal or contractual restriction on their sale.
2. Securities distributed in kind pursuant to the relief will be valued at the average of the closing bid and asked price (or in the case of exchange-traded securities, the closing sale price) at which the relevant securities were quoted on the relevant exchange or system during the five trading days immediately preceding the distribution. Members will receive notice of the basis for the valuation at the time of or before distribution.
3. Excelsior agrees to use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that securities that are the subject of an in-kind distribution are transferred to its members as soon as practicable following their valuation in connection with the allocation of the Incentive Carried Interest, and in any event within 30 days thereof.[3] 
           Distributions will be recommended by Applicants, and the Board of Managers of Excelsior will approve each distribution and establish its record date, which will also be the valuation date. Prior to an in-kind distribution, members who are not account holders at U.S. Trust will be requested to provide brokerage instructions or establish an account if necessary, and procedures will be followed to assure that members who respond on a timely basis will receive the portfolio securities promptly. Members that hold accounts at U.S. Trust will receive distributions within five (5) business days of the record date.

	ITEM 1.








	BUSINESS.








	Overview





	Excelsior Venture Partners III, LLC (the Company) is a Delaware limited liability company organized on February 18, 2000. The Company is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
	operating as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), and, in connection with its initial offering of units, registered said offering of units
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). BDCs are a special type of investment company, as defined and regulated by the Investment Company Act, which focus primarily on investing in the privately issued
	securities of eligible portfolio companies, as defined by the Investment Company Act. A BDC must also make available significant managerial assistance to such companies. The Companys investment objective is to achieve long-term capital
	appreciation by investing in domestic venture capital and other private companies and, to a lesser extent, domestic and international private funds, negotiated private investments in public companies and international direct investments that the
	Investment Advisers (defined herein) believe offer significant long-term capital appreciation.




	UST Advisers Inc. serves as investment
	adviser (the Investment Adviser) to the Company pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. Until July 1, 2007, United States Trust Company, National Association acting through its registered investment advisory division, U.S.
	TrustNew York Asset Management Division, has served as investment sub-adviser to the Company (the Investment Sub-Adviser, and together with the Investment Adviser, the Investment Advisers), pursuant to an investment
	sub-advisory agreement. The Investment Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America), a bank holding and financial holding company. Prior to July 1, 2007, the Investment Adviser was
	an indirect subsidiary of U.S. Trust Corporation, a registered financial holding company, which, in turn, was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Charles Schwab Corporation. All officers of the Company are employees and/or officers of the Investment
	Adviser. The Investment Adviser is responsible for performing the management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company.




	Pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File 333-30986), which was originally declared effective on September 7, 2000, the Company was authorized to offer an unlimited number of units of membership
	interest with no par value. The Company sold 295,210 units via a public offering, which closed on May 11, 2001, for gross proceeds totaling $147,605,000. Units of the Company were made available through Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., the
	Companys principal distributor (the Distributor).




	The Company incurred offering costs associated with the public
	offering totaling $1,468,218. Net proceeds to the Company from the public offering, after offering costs, totaled $146,136,782.




	The
	Companys Certificate of Formation provides that the duration of the Company will be ten years from the final subscription closing date, subject to the rights of the Board of Managers to extend the term for up to two additional two-year
	periods.

	Investments Held  Private






	Archemix Corporation

	(Archemix)







	Description

	: Archemix is a biopharmaceutical company leading the development of aptamers as a new class of directed therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of chronic and acute disease. Aptamers can be used in a wide range of
	disease areas, including many of those currently addressed by protein-based therapeutics, and can be produced quickly and economically. With a portfolio of over 300 patents and patent applications, Archemix holds the key to the development of
	aptamer technology and its implications for the pharmaceutical industry. Archemix is focused on using its expertise to aggressively pursue drug discovery and development in a variety of areas. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested
	$2.7 million in Archemix.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: Archemix continues to progress in terms of research. Archemix filed an S-1
	initial registration statement and as a result no further comments will be made due to quiet period restrictions.





	Cydelity

	(Cydelity,
	formerly Datanautics, Inc.)







	Description

	: Cydelity is a provider of Internet Security and Online Fraud Management solutions
	to combat security infringements. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $10.4 million in Cydelity.





	2007 Activity and
	Outlook

	: Since the Company was unable to support Cydelity on its own and Cydelity was not able to secure additional financings, the Cydelity board pursued an M&A transaction to sell Cydelity in early 2007. As a result, the Company was able
	to generate $1.0 million for its investment in Cydelity from the M&A deal, thereby generating a realized loss of $9.4 million.

	Ethertronics, Inc.

	(Ethertronics)







	Description

	: Ethertronics designs and manufactures the industrys only Isolated
	Magnetic Dipole


	TM



	(IMD) internal antennas for wireless devices. Used in cellular and wireless LAN applicationsphones, notebooks, LAN
	cards, PDAs, Bluetooth devices and GPS receiversIMD antennas provide longer-range, increased signal strength and improved voice/data quality inside buildings, particularly in noisy environments and in fringe network coverage areas. As of
	October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $9.2 million in Ethertronics.






	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: In 2007,
	Ethertronics met all the sales, operations and cash flow goals set by the investors and board. Ethertronics has become a key supplier to top tier vendors like Amoi, Casio, Compal, HP, Lenovo, Mobicom, Samsung, Symbol/Motorola and Techfaith.
	Ethertronics has an aggressive growth plan for next year including significant revenue and profit growth plans.





	Genoptix, Inc.

	(Genoptix)







	Description

	: Genoptix provides Personalized Medicine Services to hematologists and oncologists and
	their patients through its CLIA- and CAP-certified testing laboratory to aid in the treatment of blood and bone-marrow malignancies. Genoptixs Personalized Medicine Services combines proprietary and exclusive tests with advanced clinical
	techniques to provide comprehensive evaluation to individual patients. Genoptix tests monitor an individual patients response to chemotherapeutic agents in leukemia and other blood-related cancers. These services help physicians deliver
	personalized patient management which results in accurate diagnoses, more effective treatment, reduced adverse effects, enhanced monitoring and improved outcomes As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $4.8 million in Genoptix and has
	generated proceeds thus far of $1.1 million.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: Genoptix has continued to grow rapidly in 2007 and achieved
	profitability throughout the year. Genoptix continues to investigate additional offerings that would complement its existing suite of hematology/oncology related testing services. In October of 2007, Genoptix completed an initial public offering of
	common stock; its common stock is now traded on Nasdaq under the symbol GXDX.





	LogicLibrary, Inc.

	(LogicLibrary)







	Description

	: LogicLibrary is the leading provider of a software system that enables the management and reuse of software
	development assets for large enterprises and IT environments. Logic Librarys patent-pending technology provides a comprehensive and collaborative approach for creating, migrating and integrating enterprise applications for use in
	service-oriented architecture, web services and other software development initiatives. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $5.4 million in LogicLibrary.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: LogicLibrary continues to make progress in providing service-oriented architecture (SOA) solutions to
	Fortune 1000 companies. As is the case with several others of our portfolio companies, LogicLibrary and its board of directors are exploring certain potential M&A opportunities given what we perceive as the desire on the part of certain larger
	software vendors to build up their positions in the service-oriented architecture software development where LogicLibrary is positioned. The Company anticipates a potential transaction in mid-2008.





	NanoOpto Corporation

	(NanoOpto)







	Description

	: NanoOpto is applying proprietary nano-fabrication technology to the rapid design and high volume manufacturing of nano-optic devices for optical components and systems for consumer electronics, commercial, and
	communications platforms. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $4.8 million in NanoOpto.




	 




	3








	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: Since the Company and other co-investors were unable to support
	NanoOpto for the 2008 financing plans, NanoOptos board pursued a M&A transaction to sell the company and completed the transaction in mid-2007. As a result, the Company expects to collect $0.1 million from NanoOpto as a debtor of the
	Company and the equity invested was written off, thereby generating a realized loss of $4.6 million.





	OpVista, Inc.

	(OpVista)







	Description

	: OpVista provides advanced optical network solutions for advanced video and IP services. OpVistas reconfigurable
	optical transport systems are uniquely suited to deliver triple play convergence, especially advanced video and IP services, for cable and communications service providers. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $15.4 million in
	OpVista.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: In 2007, OpVista has become one of the leading suppliers of advance video solutions to the
	cable markets and is a preferred vendor for Cox, Time Warner Cable, TW Telco, Liberty Media, Service Electric and others. However, due to some execution failures, market dynamics and competitive pressures in mid-2007, OpVista has undergone
	significant management and strategy changes. Currently, OpVista is in the middle of raising a large financing to fund the 2008 restructured operating plan.





	Pilot Software, Inc.

	(Pilot)







	Description

	: Pilot provides operational performance management
	solutionsa combination of domain expertise, a proven approach and award-winning softwarethat enable organizations to rapidly achieve objectives by aligning execution with strategy. Sample customers who are using Pilots solutions
	include: Kaplan University, Pinellas county, Santa Barbara county, GSA, American Heart Association, HealthNet, KLA-Tencor, Coors/Molson, K-Mart/Sears Holdings and Yahoo. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has sold its $9.5 million investment
	in Pilot, generating $12.8 million in proceeds or a 1.3x multiple.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: The Company initiated an M&A
	opportunity with SAP America, Inc. and as a result sold Pilot in early 2007 for $12.8 million of which the Company has collected $10.4 million. The remaining proceeds are held in escrow and will be released in mid-2008.





	Silverback Systems, Inc.

	(Silverback)







	Description

	: Silverback designs, manufactures and markets components which enable IP storage solutions and true network convergence for SAN, NAS and LAN. Silverback accelerates the design and performance of storage networking
	equipment through a comprehensive package of silicon, firmware and drivers. Also, because Silverback offers a complete development program, it accelerates the adoption of IP storage by helping equipment vendors provide a cost effective deployment
	solution for small, medium and eventually large enterprises. As of October 31, 2007, the Company has invested $8.3 million in Silverback and sold Silverback in early 2007 generating $0.7 million in proceeds. As a result, the Company realized a
	loss of $7.6 million.





	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: Silverback was sold during the first quarter of 2007. The Company received $0.7
	million in consideration and has collected $0.4 million during 2007. The remaining proceeds will be collected in mid-2008 assuming no breach of customary warranties.





	Tensys Medical, Inc.

	(Tensys)







	Description

	: Tensys designs, develops,
	manufactures and markets a continuous, non-invasive arterial blood pressure management system. This method is more effective than intermittent cuff-based systems and far less invasive than arterial cannulation. As of October 31, 2007, the
	Company has invested $6.5 million in Tensys.




	 




	4








	2007 Activity and Outlook

	: Tensys continues to invest in research and development to refine its
	non-invasive blood-pressure-monitoring products to improve market acceptance. Feedback from customers and increased usability of Tensys new products indicate that earlier usability issues, which were a key stumbling block, have been addressed
	successfully. As is the case with several others of the Companys portfolio companies, Tensys and its board of directors are exploring certain potential M&A opportunities given what the Company perceives as the attractiveness of
	Tensys working blood-pressure monitoring device and its associated intellectual property to certain larger medical device vendors.





	Exits





	The Company liquidated its interest in ten of its portfolio companies since inception. As a result of these exits, the Company realized
	proceeds of $40.4 million. Total cost for these ten companies was $59.8 million.




	The Company made a $10.4 million investment in Cydelity,
	of which the initial investment was made in March 2004. Due to lack of support from external and current investors, Cydelity will attempt to wind up its affairs by year-end in 2008. The Company expects to collect $1.0 million from the asset sale
	that occurred in August of 2007 as Cydelity winds down its operations.




	The Company made a $9.5 million investment in Pilot and was able to
	successfully exit the investment through a M&A transaction with SAP America, Inc. for $12.8 million.




	The Company made a $8.3 million
	investment in Silverback

	.

	Silverback was sold during the first quarter of 2007. The Company received $0.7 million in consideration and has collected $0.4 million during 2007. The remaining proceeds will be collected in mid-2008.

	For additional information concerning the Companys investments, see the financial statements beginning on page 13 of this report.





	Competition





	The Company encounters competition from
	other entities and individuals having similar investment objectives. Primary competition for desirable investments comes from investment partnerships, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, investment companies and
	wealthy individuals. Some of the competing entities and individuals have investment managers or advisers with greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and may therefore be in a stronger position than the Company to
	obtain access to attractive investments. To the extent that the Company can compete for such investments, it may not be able to do so on terms as favorable as those obtained by larger, more established investors.





	Employees





	At October 31, 2007, the Company had
	no full-time employees. All personnel of the Company are employed by and compensated by the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Investment Agreement.





	Risk Factors





	An investment in the securities of a BDC, such as the Company, involves certain risks not present in an
	investment in the securities of other companies, including other types of management investment companies.





	Portfolio Investment
	Risk

	. Under the Investment Company Act, a BDC generally must be operated for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain present and former eligible portfolio companies or certain




	 




	6







	bankrupt or insolvent companies. Generally, eligible portfolio companies include companies that at the time of initial investment (i) do not have a
	class of securities included in the Federal Reserve Boards over-the-counter margin list (i.e., unregistered, private companies) or (ii) have total assets of less than $4 million, among other things. Although investing in such private or
	small companies offers the opportunity for significant capital gains, such investments also involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses.




	The portfolio investments of the Company consist principally of securities of private companies that have been purchased in offerings not registered
	under the Securities Act or any states securities laws and may not be resold by the Company without registration or pursuant to an exemption. In addition, the securities of portfolio companies that are public companies may also be
	subject to restrictions on resale because they were acquired from the issuer in a private placement transaction or because the Company is deemed to be an affiliate of the issuer. Generally, the Company will not be able to sell these
	securities publicly without the expense and time required to register the securities under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. In addition, contractual or
	practical limitations may restrict the Companys ability to liquidate its securities in portfolio companies. These limitations on liquidity of the Companys investments could preclude or delay any disposition of such securities or reduce
	the amount of proceeds that might otherwise be realized.

COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
The Excelsior Group, making investments on behalf of opportunistic and cash-flow focused investors, focuses on the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related assets, predominately in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan Area. Most acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. Assets of this nature require attentive and aggressive asset management to maximize performance and value – this is where we add value to our clients.
Crucial to each investment’s success is The Excelsior Group’s “ownership mentality” coupled with our hands-on asset management philosophy – we think and act like the owner on each investment we make. As asset manager, we strictly adhere to our four-part strategy of (1) opportunism, (2) preservation of principal, (3) investment in areas where we have expertise, and (4) patience.
