Measurement principle
Instrument has two cores for voltage injection and current measurement.  From the defined voltage and measured current, the total circuit loop resistance is calculatedNote: For multi grounded systems only. In a multi-grounded system, the larger the number of grounding poles, the more accurate the measured value.

0.20 Ω (0.01 Ω resolution) to 1600 Ω (20 Ω resolution), 10 ranges, Zero suppression: Less than 0.02 Ω, Accuracy: ±1.5 % rdg. ±0.02 Ω


AC Current measurement
20.00 mA (0.01 mA resolution) to 60.0 A (0.1 A resolution), 5 ranges, Zero suppression: Less than 0.05 mA, Accuracy: ±2.0 % rdg. ±0.05 mA (30 Hz to 400 Hz, True RMS), Crest factor 5.0 or less (for the 60 A range, 1.7 or less)


Max. allowable input
100 A AC continuous, AC 200 A for 2 minutes or shorter (at 50/60 Hz, requires derating at frequency)


Max. rated voltage to earth
600 V AC CAT IV


Memory function
2000 data


Alarm function
For resistance measurement and current measurement, Beeps when measured value is less than or greater than threshold

    Hioki FT6381 Details
    


Hioki FT6381 Clamp On Earth TesterThe Hioki FT6381 Clamp On Earth Tester features Bluetooth wireless technology.

This product was developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in North America, Europe, and Asia, where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements.

Thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor, the FT6381 delivers a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations. At the same time, we have increased the size of the grip used to open the sensor, allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies. Finally, the FT6381’s incorporation of Bluetooth wireless technology allows it to be linked to Android handsets for report creation. 

Advanced Features: 
    Compact clamp-on sensor for ultimate convenience in confined locations
     To date, grounding resistance testers from other manufacturers have been characterized by their heavy weight and large jaws, which complicate use of the instruments due to the difficulty of attaching them to ground wires. Responding to resulting demand for more compact sensors, HIOKI engineered a low-profile sensor just 20 mm wide for both instruments so that they can be used to measure ground wires that have been installed in cramped spaces. The sensor is 50 percent smaller by volume than sensors on existing competing products.
     Larger sensor grip for improved workability
     HIOKI has enlarged the clamp sensor's grip so that it can be opened with just two fingers, enabling it to be operated with only half the force of existing competing products.
     Low power consumption for extended use
     The FT6381 use approximately half the power of competing products, maximizing work efficiency because they can be continuously used for longer periods of time.
     Bluetooth wireless technology for connectivity with Android handsets (FT6381)
     The FT6381 features Bluetooth wireless technology, allowing users to display data in real time on Android handsets and instantaneously create reports in the field including measured values, times and dates, and position data. This technology can be used to e-mail measurement results to an administrator in a remote office in real time.
     Onboard storage for 2,000 data points
     The FT6381 can store 2,000 data points (each including a grounding resistance value and a current value) in the field.

The FT6381 measure grounding resistance simply by clamping to multiple-grounded ground wires. No auxiliary grounding rod is needed, and there is no need to disconnect the ground wire from the grounding rod. The compact, low-profile sensor can be used to clamp ground wires with ease, and also provide AC current measurement functionality and can measure currents ranging from leakage current on the order of several mA to load currents of up to 60 A.

CAT IV 600V
Key Features
•	Earth resistance measurement for multi-grounded systems
•	Measure leak current with absolute certainty with highly sensitive 0.01 mA resolution (at 20.00 mA range)
•	Measure load current up to 60.0 A range
•	Clamp at the narrowest point
•	Data transfer to Android™ phones using Bluetooth® wireless technology (FT6381)
•	Real time data transfer, automatic report generation on Android™ phone (FT6381)




Model No. (Order Code)

Hioki FT6381 Clamp On Earth Tester with Bluetooth Communication



 
Hioki Launches Clamp On Earth Tester for Multiple Grounding Use Convenient, Low-profile Sensor is Ideal for Confined Locations FT6380 / FT6381
 
HIOKI E.E. CORPORATION is pleased to announce the launch of the FT6380 Clamp On Earth Tester for multiple grounding use and the FT6381 featuring Bluetooth® wireless technology. The two products were developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in North America, Europe, and Asia, where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements.

Thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor, the FT6380 and FT6381 deliver a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations. At the same time, we have increased the size of the grip used to open the sensor, allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies. Finally, the FT6381’s incorporation of Bluetooth® wireless technology allows it to be linked to Android™ handsets for report creation.

Need for Grounding Resistance Measurement
“Grounding” generally refers to the act of connecting an electrical device with the ground (earth) in order to zero out any potential difference. Electrical equipment must be grounded for safety reasons because ungrounded devices (that is, devices with a non-zero potential difference) may cause electric shock if they malfunction or suffer degraded components.

Utilities and service contractors need to measure grounding resistance in order to verify whether a given device has been reliably grounded. While grounding ideally eliminates any potential difference, a potential difference does in fact occur between the grounded device and the earth. This fact signals the existence of a not negligible level of resistance, which is known as grounding resistance. It is absolutely critical that we measure grounding resistance in order to ascertain whether it has been minimized to ensure optimal safety.

Easy clamping!
 



Open jaws easily with just two fingers. Only half the grip power is needed compared to typical clamp earth testers.

Now you can easily clamp the earth cable on the pole without digging. The dramatically slim 0.79 inch (20mm) jaws let you finish your job easily and efficiently.

Hioki FT6381 Clamp On Meter with Super Slim Jaw and Bluetooth
Get things done with this super slim jaw clamp on meter from Hioki.  Easy Clamping - open jaws easily with just two fingers. Only half the power is needed compared to typical clamp earth testers Clamp at the Narrowest Point - Now you can easily clamp the earth cable on the pole without digging. The dramatically slim 0.79 inch jaws let you finish your job easily and efficiently. Quick Start - No wait time after powering on. Start measuring instantly without zero-calibation High Accuracy and Repeatability - Well-designed magnetic shields eliminate the leakage flux between the two cores that often affect measurement accuarcy. Alarm Function - Set the alarm to audibly and visually notify you that the resistance or current value exceeds the thresholds. LCD with beatiful back light - With the bright back light, you can easily read the measurement value even in dark locations Large Storage Capacity - You can store up to 2000 measurement values in the field and recall them in your office later Filter function enables even more accurate measurements: Resistant mode filter: digital filter gives you steadier readings. Current mode filter: Low-pass filter eliminates harmonics current over 180Hz Create reports instantly in the field using an Android phone via a Bluetooth connection (for US, Canada and Japan only) Bluetooth Communication
