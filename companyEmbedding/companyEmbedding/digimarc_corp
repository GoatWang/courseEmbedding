Maker Of Invisible Bar Codes Surges On Amazon-Whole Foods Deal
The deal to purchase Whole Foods Market (WFM) commits Amazon.com (AMZN) to evolutionary — not revolutionary — change in the grocery industry, and that may be great news for a company whose cutting-edge invisible bar codes are just a little ahead of their time. On Monday, Needham & Co. analyst James Ricchiuti raised his price target on Digimarc (DMRC) to 42 from 33, keeping a buy rating. Ricchiuti said Amazon's deal for Whole Foods presages

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Digimarc that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed on February 23, 2017 (our "2016 Annual Report"), and other reports and filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "Digimarc," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Digimarc Corporation.  All dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts or unless otherwise noted. Percentages within the following tables may not foot due to rounding.  Digimarc, Digimarc Discover and Guardian are registered trademarks of Digimarc Corporation. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also includes trademarks and trade names owned by other parties, and all other such trademarks and trade names mentioned in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the property of their respective owners.  Overview  Digimarc Corporation, an Oregon corporation founded in 2008, enables governments and enterprises around the world to give digital identities to media and objects that computers can sense and recognize and to which they can react. We have developed Digimarc Discover(R), Digimarc Barcode and the Intuitive Computing Platform(TM) that are designed to optimize the identification of all consumer brand impressions, wherever and whenever they may appear, facilitating modern mobile-centric shopping. The platform includes means to embed "Digimarc Barcodes," invisible and inaudible barcode-like information that is recognizable by smartphones, tablets, industrial scanners, and other computer interfaces into virtually all forms of media content, including consumer product packaging. Digimarc Barcodes have many applications, including facilitating remarkably faster scanning of products at retail checkout as well as improved engagement with smartphone-equipped consumers. The Digimarc Barcode is robust yet imperceptible by people in ordinary use, allowing for reliable, efficient, economical, globally scalable, automatic identification of media without visible computer codes like traditional barcodes.  Our media identification and discovery innovations enable our business partners to create numerous applications across a wide range of media content, including solutions that:   Improve the speed of retail checkout;   Provide simple and intuitive mobile customer engagement experiences in stores;   Quickly and reliably identify and effectively manage music, movies, television programming, digital images, e-publications, documents and other printed materials, especially in light of non-linear distribution over the Internet;   Deter counterfeiting of money, media and goods, and piracy of e-publications, movies and music;   Support new digital media distribution models and methods to monetize media content;   Leverage the power of ubiquitous computing to instantly link consumers to a wealth of information and/or interactive experiences related to the media and objects they encounter each day;   Provide consumers with more choice and access to media content when, where and how they want it;   Enhance imagery and video by associating metadata or authenticating media content for government and commercial uses; and   Better secure identity documents to enhance national security and combat identity theft and fraud.  Our Intuitive Computing Platform has a proprietary foundation in signal processing innovation known as "digital watermarking," which allows imperceptible digital information to be embedded in all forms of digitally designed, produced or distributed media content and many physical objects, including photographs, movies, music, television, personal identification documents, financial instruments, industrial parts and product packages. We refer to the embedded information as the Digimarc Barcode. This digital information can be detected and read by a wide range of computers, smartphones, tablets and other digital devices.  Our inventions allow our business partners and customers to provide persistent digital identities for virtually any media content that is digitally processed at some point during its lifecycle. Our technology can be applied to printed materials, video, audio, and images to supply a wide range of consumer engagement, media management and security solutions across multiple consumer and government industry sectors. Over the years our enabling software and business processes, and associated intellectual property portfolio have grown to encompass many related technologies.  We provide our solutions directly and through our business partners. Our inventions provide a powerful element of document security, giving rise to a long-term relationship with a consortium of central banks (the "Central Banks"), and many leading companies in the information technology industry. We and our business partners have successfully propagated the use of our technology in music, movies, television broadcasts, digital images, e-publications and printed materials. Digimarc Barcodes have been used in these applications to improve media rights and asset management, reduce piracy and counterfeiting losses, improve marketing programs, permit more efficient and effective distribution of valuable media content and enhance consumer entertainment and commercial experiences.  Digimarc Barcodes can be used to enhance all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses, but quickly detected by computers, networks or other digital devices like smartphones and tablets. Unlike traditional barcodes and tags, our solution does not require publishers to give up valuable visual space in magazines and newspapers; nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the publication for readers. Digimarc Barcodes are generally imperceptible in normal use and do all that visible barcodes do, but perform better. Our Digimarc Discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to its readers on their smartphones or tablets across multiple media formats, including print, audio, video and packaging. Unique to the Digimarc Discover platform is its seamless multi-model use of various content identification technologies as needed, including Digimarc Barcode when present.  In January 2014, we introduced Digimarc Barcodes for use in consumer product packaging. These Digimarc Barcodes can contain the same information found in traditional universal product codes ("UPC"). The UPC information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface. We partnered with Datalogic, a global leader in automatic data capture and industrial automation markets and producer of barcode readers, in introducing the Digimarc Barcode to the consumer product packaging market. The first retail scanner enabled was Datalogic's MagellanTM 9800i multi-plane imaging scanner. Since then additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the Digimarc Barcode platform. Digimarc Barcodes can also connect mobile-enabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information, special offers, recommendations, reviews, social networks and more.  Our intellectual property contains many innovations in digital watermarking, content recognition (sometimes referred to as "fingerprinting"), digital rights management and related fields. To protect our inventions, we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and nondisclosure agreements and other contracts. As a result, we believe we have one of the world's most extensive patent portfolios in digital watermarking and related fields, with over 1,100 granted and pending patents as of June 30, 2017. We continue to develop and broaden our portfolio in the fields of media identification and management technology and related applications and systems. We devote significant resources to developing and protecting our inventions and continuously seek to identify and evaluate potential licensees for our patents. The patents in our portfolio have a life of approximately 20 years from the effective filing date, and up to 17 years after the patent has been granted.  The market for patent licensing has become more challenging in recent years. As a result, we have shifted our focus from direct monetization via enforcement and licensing to facilitating progress toward the realization of our vision to enrich everyday living via pervasive, intuitive computing by:   encouraging large scale adoption of our technologies by industry leaders;   improving our financial performance by enhancing our competitive differentiation;   increasing the scale and rate of growth of our products and services business; and   laying a foundation for continuing innovation.  For a discussion of activities and costs related to our research and development, see "Results of Operations -Summary - Research, development and engineering."  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Detailed information about our critical accounting policies and estimates is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2016 Annual Report ("Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"), under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," which is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Results of Operations  The following table presents statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to the three and six month periods relate to the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and all changes discussed with respect to such periods reflect changes compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.

Service revenue consists primarily of software development and consulting services. The majority of service revenue arrangements are structured as time and materials consulting agreements. Most of our service revenue is derived from contracts with the Central Banks and government agency contractors. The agreements range from several months to several years in length, and our longer term contracts are subject to work plans that are reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. These contracts generally provide for billing hours worked at predetermined rates and, to a lesser extent, reimbursement for third party costs and services. Increases or decreases in the services provided under these contracts are generally subject to both volume and price changes. The volume of work is generally negotiated at least annually and can be modified as the customer's needs change. We also have provisions in our longer term contracts that allow for specific hourly rate price increases on an annual basis to account for cost of living variables. Contracts with government agency contractors are generally shorter term in nature, less linear in billings and less predictable than our longer term contracts because the contracts with government agency contractors are subject to government budgets and funding.  The increases in service revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, were primarily due to more program work with the Central Banks and with a government agency contractor.  Subscription. Subscription revenue includes Digimarc Discover, Digimarc Barcode and Guardian products and services, and is generally recurring in nature, paid in advance and recognized over the term of the subscription.  The decreases in subscription revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, were primarily due to lower Guardian revenue, partially offset by higher Digimarc Discover and Digimarc Barcode revenue.  License. License revenue originates primarily from licensing our intellectual property, where we receive license fees and/or royalties as our income stream.  The increases in license revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, were primarily due to higher royalty revenue reported by our licensees.  Revenue by Geography Three Three Six Six Months Months Months Months Ended Ended Dollar Percent Ended Ended Dollar Percent June 30, June 30, Increase Increase June 30, June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenue by geography: Domestic $ 1,253 $ 1,151 $ 102 9 % $ 2,754 $ 2,284 $ 470 21 % International 4,334 4,306 28 1 % 8,924 8,753 171 2 % Total $ 5,587 $ 5,457 $ 130 2 % $ 11,678 $ 11,037 $ 641 6 % Revenue (as % of total revenue): Domestic 22 % 21 % 24 % 21 % International 78 % 79 % 76 % 79 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %  The increases in domestic revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, was primarily the result of higher service revenue from a government agency contractor and higher royalty revenue from a domestic licensee.  The increases in international revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, was primarily due to more program work with the Central Banks.  Cost of Revenue  Service. Cost of service revenue primarily includes costs that are allocated from research, development and engineering, sales and marketing and intellectual property that relate directly to performing services under our customer contracts and direct costs of program delivery. Costs include:   compensation, benefits, incentive compensation in the form of stock-based compensation and related costs of our software developers, quality assurance personnel, product managers, business development managers and other personnel where we bill our customers for time and materials costs;   payments to outside contractors that are billed to customers;   charges for equipment directly used by customers;   depreciation and other charges for machinery, equipment and software directly used by customers;   travel costs directly attributable to service and development contracts; and   charges for infrastructure and centralized costs of facilities and information technology.  Subscription. Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes:   compensation, benefits, incentive compensation in the form of stock-based compensation and related costs of operations personnel;   cost of outside contractors that provide operational support;   amortization of existing technology acquired in the acquisition of Attributor Corporation; and   Internet service provider connectivity charges and image search data fees to support the services offered to our subscription customers.  License. Cost of license revenue primarily includes:   amortization of capitalized patent costs; and   amortization of patent maintenance fees.

The change in service gross profit as a percentage of service revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, was insignificant.  The increase in subscription gross profit as a percentage of subscription revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, was due primarily to lower operations costs.  The decrease in license gross profit as a percentage of license revenue was insignificant for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016.  Operating Expenses  We allocate certain costs of research, development and engineering, sales and marketing, and intellectual property to cost of revenue when they relate directly to our customer contracts. We record all remaining, or "residual," costs as sales and marketing, research, development and engineering, general and administrative, and intellectual property expenses.

Improving the Retail Customer Experience One Barcode at a Time

“
Working with Digimarc gives us the ability to let our knowledgeable and passionate staff be the crucial customer touch point we want them to be.
 - Sean Teisher, senior IT director at New Seasons


New Seasons Market, a leading grocery chain that prides itself on its unique neighborhood grocery shopping experience, is adopting Digimarc Barcode for its partner brands products to increase checkout speed and boost brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. Partner branded products with Digimarc-enhanced packaging will start appearing on New Seasons shelves in the first quarter of the year.
Improving the Customer Experience
With stores throughout Washington, Oregon and Northern California, New Seasons is a champion of the communities it serves and is known for its loyal following of customers who care about their food and the store they bought it from.
The Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly replicated across all sides of a package and does not infringe upon existing designs. The package can be scanned at any angle, significantly increasing checkout speed and accuracy. This saves the retailer money, as well as improving the customer experience at checkout, by allowing cashiers to interact with their customers during the process and ensure they received an optimal in store experience.
Responding to Demand for More Product Information
Digimarc Barcode makes product information more readily available to consumers as they shop in the aisle with their smartphones, ranging from inspirational cooking ideas to stories behind their local suppliers. Smartphone-assisted shopping is an increasingly common trend, with a recent Harris Poll survey finding 78 percent of U.S. adult shoppers want more information about the products they are looking to purchase. The technology also can be used for deli product labels and point of purchase signage.
"New Seasons prides itself on providing a shopping experience that is more than just a transaction," said Sean Teisher, senior IT director at New Seasons. "Working with Digimarc gives us the ability to let our knowledgeable and passionate staff be the crucial customer touch point we want them to be. It's important to us that our employees are able to devote their attention to customers and make sure they are able to help in any way they can."
"New Seasons is a leader in creating neighborhood gathering places, delivering trademark customer service and partnering with farmers and producers to bring their customers the best in the region," said Bruce Davis, CEO at Digimarc. "We are excited for the role our Digimarc Barcode will play in further enhancing consumer engagement with their brands at retail and making greater product information accessible in a simple and easy way."

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

History[edit]
Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]

Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc Barcode[edit]
The Digimarc Barcode is a unique identifier, or code, based on imperceptible patterns that can be applied to marketing materials, including packaging, displays, ads in magazines, circulars, radio and television.[28] Digimarc Barcode is not visible or audible to people, but mobile devices, POS image scanners, and other computing technologies can read them. The code contains information and can deliver data including the same Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) currently carried in traditional product barcode symbols (UPC/EAN).[29] Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly repeated multiple times over an entire product package or printed documents. With support for Digimarc Barcodes in audio, virtually any recorded sound can also be enhanced with an inaudible signal allowing identification and interaction by the Digimarc Discover software.[30]
Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK[edit]
The Digimarc Discover software development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, EAN 13, Code 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.[31]
Content protection[edit]
Digimarc’s acquisition of Attributor Corp. allowed it to leverage its Digimarc Barcode technology to help publishers and authors prevent uncontrolled copying and sharing of ebooks and other documents online.[32]
Along with book and document protection, Digimarc protects image ownership by enhancing images with the imperceptible Digimarc Barcode, enabling photographers, designers and businesses to determine how and where their images are being used online.[33]
Customers[edit]
Retail and consumer packaged goods[edit]
In January 2015, Digimarc disclosed Wegmans, a premium regional grocer, as their first retail customer. Wegmans has enhanced products from their private label in all 85 of their stores.[34] The Oregon-based New Seasons Market became the company’s first retail customer. It started enhancing the grocer’s private label products, items such as almond butter, hot-and-spicy pickled beans and pasta with imperceptible Digimarc Barcodes.[35]
Media and entertainment[edit]
The company partnered with The Nielsen Company in 2007 to enhance audio with Digimarc Barcode for copyright security compliance.[36] Two years later, Digimarc and Nielsen and created two new companies utilizing the consumer and business data amassed by Nielsen to enhance television viewing, facilitate mobile commerce, and help television networks and consumer brands engage more deeply engage with audiences.[37] The online music recognition app, Shazam, partnered with Digimarc in 2014 to recognize Digimarc codes in printed materials. The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

History[edit]
Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]
Accolades[edit]
Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]
Accolades[edit]
Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc Barcode[edit]
The Digimarc Barcode is a unique identifier, or code, based on imperceptible patterns that can be applied to marketing materials, including packaging, displays, ads in magazines, circulars, radio and television.[28] Digimarc Barcode is not visible or audible to people, but mobile devices, POS image scanners, and other computing technologies can read them. The code contains information and can deliver data including the same Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) currently carried in traditional product barcode symbols (UPC/EAN).[29] Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly repeated multiple times over an entire product package or printed documents. With support for Digimarc Barcodes in audio, virtually any recorded sound can also be enhanced with an inaudible signal allowing identification and interaction by the Digimarc Discover software.[30]
Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK[edit]
The Digimarc Discover software development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, EAN 13, Code 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.[31]
Content protection[edit]
Digimarc’s acquisition of Attributor Corp. allowed it to leverage its Digimarc Barcode technology to help publishers and authors prevent uncontrolled copying and sharing of ebooks and other documents online.[32]
Along with book and document protection, Digimarc protects image ownership by enhancing images with the imperceptible Digimarc Barcode, enabling photographers, designers and businesses to determine how and where their images are being used online.[33]
Customers[edit]
Retail and consumer packaged goods[edit]
In January 2015, Digimarc disclosed Wegmans, a premium regional grocer, as their first retail customer. Wegmans has enhanced products from their private label in all 85 of their stores.[34] The Oregon-based New Seasons Market became the company’s first retail customer. It started enhancing the grocer’s private label products, items such as almond butter, hot-and-spicy pickled beans and pasta with imperceptible Digimarc Barcodes.[35]
Media and entertainment[edit]
The company partnered with The Nielsen Company in 2007 to enhance audio with Digimarc Barcode for copyright security compliance.[36] Two years later, Digimarc and Nielsen and created two new companies utilizing the consumer and business data amassed by Nielsen to enhance television viewing, facilitate mobile commerce, and help television networks and consumer brands engage more deeply engage with audiences.[37] The online music recognition app, Shazam, partnered with Digimarc in 2014 to recognize Digimarc codes in printed materials. The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]

The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

For retailers, Digimarc Barcode enhances your private label packaging design by modulating the color data in the pixels that compose the design.

FAQs
Why should I add a Digimarc Barcode to my private label packages?

Differentiate your private-label products from national brands by delivering additional information when shoppers scan your packaging with a smartphone. And, cashiers can more quickly scan items at checkout because your products include dozens of imperceptible barcodes on every side of the package. Some major retailers have experienced as much as a 30 percent improvement in front-of-store throughput.

Why do I need a digital strategy?

Online shopping and mobile devices have become common place for most consumers, and younger shoppers expect to buy when and where they want. Enhanced product packaging delivers digital content and discounts to shoppers anywhere, and new data insights from scanning behavior helps you understand your loyalists.

What devices/apps can scan Digimarc Barcodes?

All major manufacturers of retail POS scanners support scanning of Digimarc Barcode at checkout.

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

History[edit]
Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]
Accolades[edit]
Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc Barcode[edit]
The Digimarc Barcode is a unique identifier, or code, based on imperceptible patterns that can be applied to marketing materials, including packaging, displays, ads in magazines, circulars, radio and television.[28] Digimarc Barcode is not visible or audible to people, but mobile devices, POS image scanners, and other computing technologies can read them. The code contains information and can deliver data including the same Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) currently carried in traditional product barcode symbols (UPC/EAN).[29] Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly repeated multiple times over an entire product package or printed documents. With support for Digimarc Barcodes in audio, virtually any recorded sound can also be enhanced with an inaudible signal allowing identification and interaction by the Digimarc Discover software.[30]
Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK[edit]
The Digimarc Discover software development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, EAN 13, Code 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.[31]
Content protection[edit]
Digimarc’s acquisition of Attributor Corp. allowed it to leverage its Digimarc Barcode technology to help publishers and authors prevent uncontrolled copying and sharing of ebooks and other documents online.[32]
Along with book and document protection, Digimarc protects image ownership by enhancing images with the imperceptible Digimarc Barcode, enabling photographers, designers and businesses to determine how and where their images are being used online.[33]
Customers[edit]
Retail and consumer packaged goods[edit]
In January 2015, Digimarc disclosed Wegmans, a premium regional grocer, as their first retail customer. Wegmans has enhanced products from their private label in all 85 of their stores.[34] The Oregon-based New Seasons Market became the company’s first retail customer. It started enhancing the grocer’s private label products, items such as almond butter, hot-and-spicy pickled beans and pasta with imperceptible Digimarc Barcodes.[35]
Media and entertainment[edit]
The company partnered with The Nielsen Company in 2007 to enhance audio with Digimarc Barcode for copyright security compliance.[36] Two years later, Digimarc and Nielsen and created two new companies utilizing the consumer and business data amassed by Nielsen to enhance television viewing, facilitate mobile commerce, and help television networks and consumer brands engage more deeply engage with audiences.[37] The online music recognition app, Shazam, partnered with Digimarc in 2014 to recognize Digimarc codes in printed materials. The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

History[edit]
Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]
Accolades[edit]
Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc Barcode[edit]
The Digimarc Barcode is a unique identifier, or code, based on imperceptible patterns that can be applied to marketing materials, including packaging, displays, ads in magazines, circulars, radio and television.[28] Digimarc Barcode is not visible or audible to people, but mobile devices, POS image scanners, and other computing technologies can read them. The code contains information and can deliver data including the same Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) currently carried in traditional product barcode symbols (UPC/EAN).[29] Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly repeated multiple times over an entire product package or printed documents. With support for Digimarc Barcodes in audio, virtually any recorded sound can also be enhanced with an inaudible signal allowing identification and interaction by the Digimarc Discover software.[30]
Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK[edit]
The Digimarc Discover software development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, EAN 13, Code 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.[31]
Content protection[edit]
Digimarc’s acquisition of Attributor Corp. allowed it to leverage its Digimarc Barcode technology to help publishers and authors prevent uncontrolled copying and sharing of ebooks and other documents online.[32]
Along with book and document protection, Digimarc protects image ownership by enhancing images with the imperceptible Digimarc Barcode, enabling photographers, designers and businesses to determine how and where their images are being used online.[33]
Customers[edit]
Retail and consumer packaged goods[edit]
In January 2015, Digimarc disclosed Wegmans, a premium regional grocer, as their first retail customer. Wegmans has enhanced products from their private label in all 85 of their stores.[34] The Oregon-based New Seasons Market became the company’s first retail customer. It started enhancing the grocer’s private label products, items such as almond butter, hot-and-spicy pickled beans and pasta with imperceptible Digimarc Barcodes.[35]
Media and entertainment[edit]
The company partnered with The Nielsen Company in 2007 to enhance audio with Digimarc Barcode for copyright security compliance.[36] Two years later, Digimarc and Nielsen and created two new companies utilizing the consumer and business data amassed by Nielsen to enhance television viewing, facilitate mobile commerce, and help television networks and consumer brands engage more deeply engage with audiences.[37] The online music recognition app, Shazam, partnered with Digimarc in 2014 to recognize Digimarc codes in printed materials. The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
In 2010, Digimarc sold the licensing rights to a portion of its patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures as part of a profit sharing partnership.[21]
In 2012, Digimarc acquired Attributor Corp., a content protection company specializing in anti-piracy services and management of copyrights for publishing, photography and corporate documents.[22]
The company formed a partnership in 2016 with GS1 US, a barcode standards organization, to promote the adoption of Digimarc Barcode by the group’s membership. Under the arrangement, GS1 uses Digimarc Barcode technology under the DWCode designation. Digimarc began collaborating with GS1 Germany, a regional offshoot, in 2016 to bring the DWCode to German retailers and manufacturers.[23]
Accolades[edit]
Digimarc was named No. 1 on Forbes 2004 list of “25 Fastest Growing Technology Companies” for the application of its technology to help prevent forgery and counterfeiting in driver licenses.[24]
In 2011, the technology trade group IEEE recognized Digimarc as having the sixth most valuable patent portfolio among software companies in the U.S.[25]
In January 2014, Digimarc set a new Guinness World Record for fastest time to scan and bag 50 items at the National Retail Federation's Annual Convention & EXPO (Retail's Big Show) 2014. With a Guinness World Record adjudicator present, company representatives scanned and bagged 50 items featuring the newly released Digimarc Barcode in 51.91 seconds - bettering the previous record of 75 seconds.[26]
In September 2015, Digimarc was honored with an Emmy Award for Technology & Engineering. The award for Steganographic Technologies for Audio/Video acknowledges Digimarc for engineering creativity in the company’s work in the entertainment industry, which has included involvement in the Nielsen television audience ratings and digital cinema protections for Blu-ray and DVD players.[27]

Digimarc Barcode[edit]
The Digimarc Barcode is a unique identifier, or code, based on imperceptible patterns that can be applied to marketing materials, including packaging, displays, ads in magazines, circulars, radio and television.[28] Digimarc Barcode is not visible or audible to people, but mobile devices, POS image scanners, and other computing technologies can read them. The code contains information and can deliver data including the same Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) currently carried in traditional product barcode symbols (UPC/EAN).[29] Digimarc Barcode is imperceptibly repeated multiple times over an entire product package or printed documents. With support for Digimarc Barcodes in audio, virtually any recorded sound can also be enhanced with an inaudible signal allowing identification and interaction by the Digimarc Discover software.[30]
Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK[edit]
The Digimarc Discover software development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, EAN 13, Code 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.[31]
Content protection[edit]
Digimarc’s acquisition of Attributor Corp. allowed it to leverage its Digimarc Barcode technology to help publishers and authors prevent uncontrolled copying and sharing of ebooks and other documents online.[32]
Along with book and document protection, Digimarc protects image ownership by enhancing images with the imperceptible Digimarc Barcode, enabling photographers, designers and businesses to determine how and where their images are being used online.[33]
Customers[edit]
Retail and consumer packaged goods[edit]
In January 2015, Digimarc disclosed Wegmans, a premium regional grocer, as their first retail customer. Wegmans has enhanced products from their private label in all 85 of their stores.[34] The Oregon-based New Seasons Market became the company’s first retail customer. It started enhancing the grocer’s private label products, items such as almond butter, hot-and-spicy pickled beans and pasta with imperceptible Digimarc Barcodes.[35]
Media and entertainment[edit]
The company partnered with The Nielsen Company in 2007 to enhance audio with Digimarc Barcode for copyright security compliance.[36] Two years later, Digimarc and Nielsen and created two new companies utilizing the consumer and business data amassed by Nielsen to enhance television viewing, facilitate mobile commerce, and help television networks and consumer brands engage more deeply engage with audiences.[37] The online music recognition app, Shazam, partnered with Digimarc in 2014 to recognize Digimarc codes in printed materials. The deal sought to optimize identification, engagement, and monetization of the marketing mix of consumer brands and broadening the portfolio of engagement opportunities.[38] Digimarc Discover Mobile SDK was integrated into Rovio’s “Angry Birds Action!” game in 2016. The game was based on The Angry Birds Movie. The music during the end credits was enhanced with Digimarc Barcode for audio which allowed players to unlock a new area of the game by opening the app during the end credits.[39]
Content protection[edit]
In 2014 the company partnered with HarperCollins Publishers and LibreDigital, a provider of ebook distribution and fulfillment services, to help to protect ebooks from being pirated during distribution.[40][41] Digimarc digitally enhanced US Bancorp’s 2011 U.S. Bancorp Annual Report and U.S. Bancorp Citizenship Report.[42][43]

Digimarc Corporation, a publicly traded technology company and inventor of several patented innovations, provides enterprise software and services for banking, retail, media, entertainment, publishing and several other industries.[3][4]
Digimarc is perhaps best-known for its digital watermarking technologies, part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 issued and pending patents globally.[5] Digimarc’s solutions enable the reliable, efficient and automatic recognition of objects and many media formats, a technology category known as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) or “discovery.” Overall, the company promotes the concept of intuitive computing and aspires to make technology instinctively easy to use, and many of its innovations are modeled on aspects of human cognition and sensory perception.[6]
Based on these principles, Digimarc invented Digimarc Barcode, a machine-readable code that is imperceptible – nearly invisible and inaudible – to people. The company also provides Digimarc Discover® software for detecting the information stored in the Digimarc Barcode. The technology can be used with several forms of content, including product packaging and other physical items, printed material including photographic images, and audio.[7]
Digimarc's products and services are in the areas of security, digital rights management (anti-piracy, counterfeit deterrence, copyright protection), advertising and media monitoring and measurement, interactive publishing, content delivery, manufacturing quality control, mobile and embedded systems software development, digital commerce, inventory management, and product packaging.[8] Digimarc partner companies that license its technologies have developed many related applications.

History[edit]
Digimarc was founded by Geoff Rhoads, an astrophysicist with a background in deep space imaging. The initial inspiration for the company came while Rhoads was photographing images of the planet Jupiter. He felt that his digital images were vulnerable on the internet, even with copyright protection.[3] In 1996, after initial venture funding,[9] Digimarc released its first product: a digital watermarking plug-in bundled with Adobe Photoshop, Corel, and Micrografix.[10] After a second round of venture funding and increased investments in research and technology, Digimarc signed a multi-year contract with a consortium of central banks.[citation needed] [11]
Current CEO Bruce Davis named to the post in 1997. He had previously headed video game development companies, such as Activision, and founded TV Guide on Screen, developing it as the leading electronic program guide for television.[12]
Digimarc went public in 1999 with its initial public offering (IPO), offering four million shares of its common stock at $20 per share.[13]
Digimarc has developed a DRM system used on bank notes of several countries. Developed for the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group, the system embeds various hidden patterns into banknote designs which are detected by code included in several popular image editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro.[14] Digimarc's system blocks users from opening images identified as bank notes.
In 2001, Digimarc acquired the ID Systems assets of bankrupt Polaroid Corporation and established Digimarc ID Systems, LLC.[15] The acquisition gave Digimarc the resources to develop IDMarc, a secure driver license technology eventually adopted by 37 state DMVs.[15]
In August 2008, Digimarc completed the sale of its ID card business to rival L-1 Identity Systems.[16] The new Digimarc corporation consists solely of its digital watermarking business and reincorporated as an Oregon company.[17][18] Digimarc sold off the majority of their patents to Intellectual Ventures in 2010 for $36 million, plus a portion of any future patents Digimarc is granted.[19] The licensing deal helped increase revenue and profits the next year, when the company earned $639,000 on revenues of $8.6 million in the third quarter.[20]
