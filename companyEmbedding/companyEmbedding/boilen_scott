Allstar Products Group Scott Boilen Named One of DRTV’s Industry Leaders to Watch


Leave a reply 


HAWTHORNE, N.Y., Aug. 31, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — When you think of direct-response marketing power players, only a few people come to mind. As Seen on TV industry veteran and Allstar Products Group President and CEO, Scott Boilen, is at the top of list.  The man behind Snuggie, Boilen is featured in the “20 People to Watch in 2016″ from HomeWorld Business Magazine.
Boilen founded Allstar Products in 1999 as a direct mail marketer and later repositioned the company to become a leading As Seen on TV marketer and distributor.  Under Boilen’s leadership Allstar has put more than 100 products on retail shelves in two decades.
Since inception, Boilen has lead Allstar through many successful As Seen on TV rollouts including the famous Snuggie ®. The blanket with sleeves has sold more than 33 million units since becoming a viral sensation in 2009, and it was this popularity that helped cement Allstar to national DRTV prominence.



“The Snuggie was one of the first products that really went viral thanks to the rise of social media. This social buzz set a new standard for our business. Just as our products evolve with audience demands, so does the way we market our inventions. A strong social media presence is now an integral part of our marketing platform,” says Boilen.
HomeWorld Business Editors listed Boilen one of the power players to watch because success in the housewares business is about finding the right formula to stay successful not just once, but time and time again. Allstar’s smart social, TV, and digital promotions along with the distribution of the right product has led to long-term, multi-SKU retail brands such as the Perfect cookware line which included thePerfect Bacon™ Bowl, or Hot Beauty accessories with Hot Buns® and Hot Designs®.
Hoping to continue this success into 2016 Allstar is currently rolling out nine new TV-supported retail items nationwide.  This is the most holiday rollout items in the company’s history.
The HomeWorld Players list is a representation from a cross section of a diverse housewares business – from established to newly installed company leaders.
The group is diverse, not just in the scope of their businesses and responsibilities, but also in their individual experiences and contributions to the industry. All, however, have played a role in shaping the housewares industry.
A list of all the 2016 HomeWorld Players can be found here:http://www.homeworldbusiness.com/Retail/The-Players-People-To-Watch-In-2016/28301
About Allstar Products GroupAllstar Products Group is a leading direct response and consumer products company making quality products available to U.S. and international consumers through direct response television as well as internet, direct mail and retail channels.  Allstar Products has a diverse product portfolio including popular consumer brands such as Snuggie® Magic Mesh®, Hot Designs®, Secret Extensions® and Wobble Wag Giggle®.

Throwback Thursday:  Snuggie as the Leader in Social Media


Leave a reply 


In a 2013 article titled, “Snuggie: Social media’s first viral success,” Melissa Hincha-Ownby explores how the Snuggie® was a leader in social media marketing and viral videos.
“Social media is a powerful tool,” Hincha-Ownby begins her article, “and if anyone doubts the power that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media sites have then they merely need to look at the success of the Snuggie.”  She goes on to discuss how social media helped Allstar Products Group – the makers of the Snuggie  – achieve skyrocketing sales.

It was noted that Snuggie commercials received millions of views on YouTube and Snuggie parodies received even more attention.
Allstar Products Group CEO, Scott Boilen, was quoted saying Snuggie “was the first product that really went viral, that really went mainstream like that. It was probably the first product that had the advantage of social media really peaking.”

Throwback Thursday:  Scott Boilen and the Cult of the Snuggie

It was early 2009 when USA Today announced that Snuggie was taking over America with the “Cult of the Snuggie.”

The article, titled “Snuggie gets a warm embrace from pop culture” notes how “Snuggies seem to be everywhere.”  On Facebook and Youtube, on the Tonight Show and the Ellen Degeneres Show, even among the crowd at Obama’s inauguration.
“Every once in a while, a product transcends advertising to become part of pop culture,” Scott Boilen, president and CEO of Allstar Products Group said in the USA Today article.  “Snuggie got the highest rating ever for any product….” Scott Boilen goes on to say.
Today Snuggie is a permanent part of pop culture and the Snuggie line continues to grow.

Throwback Thursday!  Scott Boilen and Snuggie on the Oprah Show


Leave a reply 


Scott Boilen appeared on Oprah via satellite back in March of 2009 to discuss the Snuggie with a Snuggie-wearing group including Ms. Winfrey (in hot pink) and Tyler Perry (in a zebra print). Scott Boilen attributed part of the product’s impressive sales numbers to the fact that people were spending more time at home and wanting to simply feel warm and comfortable.

Scott Boilen Discusses Snuggie Success


1 Reply 


A recent Yahoo Finance article discussed “surprisingly simply ideas” that have both resonated with a broad range of consumers and became products which generated huge sales. Included among the list is the popular As Seen on TV product, the Snuggie. The Snuggie, created by Allstar Products Group, appears like a simple idea that could have been created years ago. “It’s definitely one of those ideas that’s so simple that a lot of people might say to themselves, ‘Why didn’t I think of that?’” says Scott Boilen, founding member and president and CEO of Allstar Products Group.
“It had actually been around in various forms for a few years with similar products available in the backs of catalogs, but nobody really knew about them,” Scott Boilen continues, so Allstar decided to create and market their own version. The rest is As Seen on TV history and soon we all saw the Snuggie go viral!
Scott Boilen says sales have remained consistent after the first-year spike and he believes the broad-reaching appeal of the Snuggie is a key element to its success. “I think what clicked for consumers is that the Snuggie appealed to everyone….Doesn’t matter if you’re a kid, a senior citizen, a mom, a guy — everyone can wear one. The market potential was limitless.”

Scott Boilen Discusses the Power of Humor


1 Reply 


In a Yahoo Finance segment analyzing the reasons behind Allstar’s successful Snuggie product line, Scott Boilen discusses the marketing power of humor.
“Sometimes you need to be a little bit of joke” CEO Scott Boilen tells Yahoo Finance reporter Lauren Lyster. “You need to stop people as they’re in their viewing habits so they say ‘that’s pretty funny.’”
“So you kinda are in on the joke?” Lyster asks. “Absolutely,” Scott Boilen responds.
Scott Boilen goes to discuss how the Snuggies has revolutionized the way As Seen on TV products are sold in retail stores. “I think Snuggie, and a few other products around that time frame, the velocity that they moved at retail got us from the back of the store to the front of the store.”

Scott Boilen on Marketing a Brand New Product


Leave a reply 


In an Inc.com article entitled “How to Market a Brand New Product” Drew Gannon explores the phases one can take to turn an unknown name and product into a consumer success and Allstar Products Group CEO, Scott Boilen, offers a number of insights.
“With tens of thousands of inventions conceived each year, turning an innovative new product into a consumer staple isn’t easy” Gannon reports. “It requires creativity, ingenuity, and persistence to break into a market and convince consumers they need something that never existed before.” The Snuggie blanket is a perfect example of how to turn an invention into a success.

When Snuggie commercials launched in late 2008 the response by consumers was often sheer laugher. “[B]y the time the ad showed an entire snuggie-clad family cheering at a sporting event, some viewers were too busy laughing to pick up the phone” Gannon recalls. But Scott Boilen and Allstar Products Group had a solid marketing plan and they watched as four million Snuggies were sold in four months.
“Within months of its introduction, the Snuggie transformed from a virtually unknown product into a pop culture phenomenon, appearing on The Today Show, referenced on hit TV comedy 30 Rock, and featured in the tabloids. Hundreds of Facebook groups and YouTube parodies spread awareness and boosted sales.
“Once we got people talking, it turned into a great product,” says Scott Boilen. “It was almost like why wouldn’t a blanket have sleeves?”
A key phase in marketing a new product is designing a campaign with built-in motivation. “Allstar Products intentionally gave its product a quirky name and an over-the-top commercial to promote fun and fashion” says Gannon. “But, the Snuggie still upheld Allstar’s core purpose: problem solving.”
“We’re a problem-solution company,” says Scott Boilen. “We show a problem to a consumer and give them an excellent way to solve it at a good price.” Scott Boilen and Allstar’s problem-solving method considers daily activities and enhances them with the introduction of a new idea.
After Gannon’s review of ways one can focus on the descriptors in their marketing of a new product and the ways can prove to consumers that the product works, Gannon considers his final stage: how to “personalize it.”
“Since introducing its three original colors in 2008, the Snuggie has relied on its consumers…to create the next generation of Snuggies” Gannon notes.
“They’re giving longevity to our brand,” says Scott Boilen. “With any product, make sure you’re connecting with your customer, make sure you’re communicating with them, and make sure you’re partnering with them to build your brand for the future.”

About Scott Boilen
American entrepreneur Scott Boiler is the President of Allstar Products and he has an estimated net worth of $200 million. He is also the man behind The Snuggie which was founded in 2008 and is thought to be a ridiculous idea. It is a sleeved and body-length blanket which is usually made of fleece or Vellux material. Its design is similar to a bathrobe that is meant to be worn backwards. It has been marketed in different brands such as the Snuggie, Snuggler, Doojo, Toastly Wrap, and Slanket.

During its first year, The Snuggie had sold 20 million items. With stronger marketing, the “cult of Snuggie” blanket with sleeves generated close to $40 million in its first three months. Jay Leno, Whoopie Goldberg and Ellen DeGeneres are among those who featured the product on their shows. The product has been ridiculously popular and this led to Snuggie pub crawls, YouTube Snuggie mockery clips and a lot of gag gifts.

 Scott Boilen is the CEO of Allstar Products Group and the man behind the famous Snuggie: the blanket with sleeves. Scott Boilen has worked tirelessly to ensure a stable leadership position for Allstar in the consumer brand space. Boilen has been quoted as saying “I am positive that we have assembled a strong, effective team of specialists who, when combined, are so much more than the sum of their parts. It is rewarding to say with confidence that we have a first-class team.”
It is the network of individuals, with Scott Boilen as CEO, that sets Allstar Marketing apart as a leader in a variety of product categories (including Hardware, Housewares, Pet, Beauty, and more). Scott Boilen, and his team, prove time and again that the DRTV success of Snuggie was not a fluke, but rather the result of combining a strong leadership team with a savvy support staff.

After speaking with Scott Boilen, you can’t help but share his enthusiasm. Boilen explains, “We exist to find, support and bring solutions to market. We vibe off your genius. Put simply, your success is the fuel to our fire.” Scott Boilen is passionate about products and constantly seeks to learn, listen and take advice from product inventors directly. Scott will be the first to admit that, “the inventors often know what works and what doesn’t. Their products are their babies and it is our job to respect and support those positions.” The Allstar leadership team – led by Scott Boilen – often helps an inventor’s dream to become a reality.
In addition to his leadership at Allstar Products Groups, Scott Boilen serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Retailing Association and the Board of Directors for the Food Bank for Westchester (New York). Boilen holds a Bachelors degree in Business Administration from State University of New York at Albany and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Fordham University.

Allstar Products Group Scott Boilen Named One of DRTV's Industry Leaders to Watch

HAWTHORNE, N.Y., Aug. 31, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- When you think of direct-response marketing power players, only a few people come to mind. As Seen on TV industry veteran and Allstar Products Group President and CEO, Scott Boilen, is at the top of list.  The man behind The Snuggie® Blanket, Boilen is featured in the "20 People to Watch in 2016" from HomeWorld Business Magazine. 
Boilen founded Allstar Products in 1999 as a direct mail marketer and later repositioned the company to become a leading As Seen on TV marketer and distributor.  Under Boilen's leadership Allstar has put more than 100 products on retail shelves in two decades. 
Since inception, Boilen has lead Allstar through many successful As Seen on TV rollouts including the famous Snuggie®. The blanket with sleeves has sold more than 33 million units since becoming a viral sensation in 2009, and it was this popularity that helped cement Allstar to national DRTV prominence.
"The Snuggie® was one of the first products that really went viral thanks to the rise of social media. This social buzz set a new standard for our business. Just as our products evolve with audience demands, so does the way we market our inventions. A strong social media presence is now an integral part of our marketing platform," says Boilen. 
HomeWorld Business Editors listed Boilen one of the power players to watch because success in the housewares business is about finding the right formula to stay successful not just once, but time and time again. Allstar's smart social, TV, and digital promotions along with the distribution of the right product has led to long-term, multi-SKU retail brands such as the Perfect cookware line which included the Perfect Bacon™ Bowl, or Hot Beauty accessories with Hot Buns® and Hot Designs®. 
Hoping to continue this success into 2016 Allstar is currently rolling out nine new TV-supported retail items nationwide.  This is the most holiday rollout items in the company's history.
The HomeWorld Players list is a representation from a cross section of a diverse housewares business -- from established to newly installed company leaders.
The group is diverse, not just in the scope of their businesses and responsibilities, but also in their individual experiences and contributions to the industry. All, however, have played a role in shaping the housewares industry.
A list of all the 2016 HomeWorld Players can be found here: http://www.homeworldbusiness.com/Retail/The-Players-People-To-Watch-In-2016/28301 
About Allstar Products GroupAllstar Products Group is a leading direct response and consumer products company making quality products available to U.S. and international consumers through direct response television as well as internet, direct mail and retail channels.  Allstar Products has a diverse product portfolio including popular consumer brands such as Snuggie® Magic Mesh®, Hot Designs®, Secret Extensions® and Wobble Wag Giggle®.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
