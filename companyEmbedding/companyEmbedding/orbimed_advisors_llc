The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.
