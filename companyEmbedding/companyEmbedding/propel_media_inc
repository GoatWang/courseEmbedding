Forward Looking Statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements, based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Kitara's and Future Ads' management, are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of events, factors and conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Kitara and Future Ads and not all of which are known to Kitara or Future Ads, including, without limitation those risk factors described from time to time in Kitara's reports filed with the SEC, including the definitive proxy statement/prospectus relating to the merger. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: loss of key advertising customers; inability to acquire new advertising customers; inability to expand video content library; inability to achieve projected results; inability to protect intellectual property; inability to execute acquisition strategy; inability to effectively manage growth; failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired businesses; competition; loss of key personnel; increases in costs of operations; continued compliance with government regulations; and general economic conditions. Most of these factors are outside the control of Kitara and Future Ads and are difficult to predict. The information set forth herein should be read in light of such risks. Neither Kitara nor Future Ads assumes any obligation to update the information contained in this press release except as required by law.
