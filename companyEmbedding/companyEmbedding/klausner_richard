 Overview








  Overview 



"In the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master, and everyone has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the operator.  This man, unless the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life." 1

NEAVS Initiatives

Cruelty-free Cosmetics and Household Products: NEAVS is committed to supporting companies that do not engage in animal testing during any stage of product development and instead use humane and more effective non-animal testing. Our programs and priorities engage in coalition efforts as well as our own initiatives to replace animal testing with better and more humane science.
	 
Fellowship Grant for Alternatives to Animal Research in Women's Health and Sex Differences: The American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research (AFAAR) and NEAVS offer a one-year, $40,000 postdoctoral fellowship grant to a woman committed to developing, validating, or using alternatives to animal methods in the investigation of women's health or sex differences.
	 
Mandating Alternatives to Animal Testing: NEAVS is a founding member of the Mandatory Alternatives Petition (MAP) coalition, which works to encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to develop better policy guidelines regarding the use of non-animal, in vitro testing methods to meet FDA requirements for drug or device approval.

Why Alternatives? 
Worldwide estimates on the number of vertebrate animals used in science—from mice to nonhuman primates—range from the tens of millions to more than 100 million annually. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated that over 25 million animals are used each year in scientific research, testing, and education. Animals used include cats, dogs, rabbits, ferrets, fish, pigs, sheep, monkeys, chimpanzees, and more.
In education, animals are kept as “pets” in classrooms and used in biology and psychology classes, graduate training courses, and science fair projects. Cats, fetal pigs, and frogs are the most commonly dissected vertebrate species in science classes; frogs, who are typically wild-caught, account for roughly half of the animals dissected in elementary and secondary schools.
In research, scientists utilize animals for a number of different purposes, including the development and testing of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer products, and military weapons. The majority of animals used in research and testing are rats, mice, and birds because of their low cost, high availability, and ease of breeding. The scientific debate about using animals in research and testing lies in the simple fact that animals are not predictive for human responses—be it for drugs or for understanding human disease. Two simple and familiar examples of products being deadly to animals are aspirin being poisonous to cats while providing pain relief in humans, and chocolate being toxic to dogs but practically a staple for many people.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has an annual budget of more than $30 billion and is the largest single funding agency in the U.S. for animal research. Tragically, the NIH spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year funding a bottomless pit of duplicated animal research that accomplishes nothing more than funneling tax dollars into government-supported laboratories. Many research facilities receive well over $100 million yearly and some laboratories approach $200 million. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) who evaluate projects for approval are heavily staffed by animal researchers, affiliated veterinarians, and others with vested interests in animal research.  Sadly, the current system provides funding approval for virtually any project and has led to a steady climb in animal research. In 2010, roughly 40 percent of the grants and contracts funded by the NIH involved animal research.
In contrast to relevant in vitro, epidemiological, and clinical studies, animal experiments have caused immense suffering and wasted billions of dollars and decades of time that could have been spent finding the preventions, treatments, and cures humans need. Traditional toxicity tests performed on animals have resulted in the deaths of millions of animals each year, while mostly producing data that is inaccurate or irrelevant to humans. To be valid, science must be predictive, and to be considered reliable, it must be consistently so. Animal data is neither. Animals who are infected in the lab do not mimic human disease; physiology differs among species and animal "models" are incapable of elucidating the complex nature of disease in humans. For example, animal experimentation has provided little, if anything, in the understanding and treatment of AIDS—a major cause of death in humans. Of the more than 80 HIV vaccines that have proven safe and efficacious in chimpanzees (as well as other nonhuman primates), all have failed to protect or prove safe in humans in nearly 200 human clinical trials. With cancer research, in one 2006 study researchers from Wake Forest University School of Medicine claimed that they cured many types and stages of cancer (the second leading cause of death to cardiovascular disease in humans) without side effects when tested in mice. Of course, researchers are still hoping that what they have learned will someday be applied to human treatments. As stated by Dr. Richard Klausner, former Director of the National Cancer Institute, “We have cured cancer in mice for decades—and it simply didn’t work in humans.”[2]
Conclusion
There is, however, hope for the future as federal agencies and scientists begin to more openly recognize and accept that solutions to cardiovascular disease, cancer, AIDS, and other human health problems lie, not in animal-based methods, but in directly applicable human-based studies—science without vivisection, science NEAVS supports. Recognition of the inadequacy of animal toxicity testing has resulted in the development of better techniques that are able to produce comparable toxicity values of chemicals applicable to humans. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency and the NIH are currently evaluating new technologies in molecular, cellular, and computational sciences to supplement or replace more traditional methods of toxicity testing—new technologies that are producing safer, more complete, and more relevant data for humans.
News of alternatives to harmful animal use continues to flood our desks every day—renewing our faith in what science can and will do once it sets its priorities straight. For instance, a non-animal lung tissue alternative has been created by scientists at the Harvard Medical School and the Children's Hospital in Boston. The “lung-on-a-chip” mimics a human lung, allowing scientists to observe both the basic functions of the lung and the effects that environmental toxins or drugs may have on living lung tissue—heralding, for example, the end of restraining beagles in forced inhalation experiments. Stated by Dr. Donald Ingber, lead scientist of the Harvard study at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, “We really can't understand how biology works unless we put it in the physical context of real living cells, tissues and organs." Therefore, "organs-on-chips could replace many animal studies in the future.”3 
NEAVS and its programs will help hasten the inevitable and necessary transition away from animal-based experimentation, testing, and teaching, toward science and science education governed by progressive scientific thought and compassionate ethics. Our accomplishments include funding world-renowned scientists who have developed scientifically more predictive alternatives to such cruel toxicity tests as the LD50, in which researchers slowly poison animals to death. We are a founding member of a coalition to bring consumers information on products not tested on animals. We petition, challenge, and testify at hearings before federal agencies such as the NIH, the Institute of Medicine, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a variety of issues, including mandating that pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and other entities regulated by the FDA must use existing alternatives to replace cruel animal tests. Most importantly, we expose the suffering of millions of animals every day in laboratories throughout the world—educating and inspiring the public to join us in our work! The American public only reluctantly supports the use of animals in research, and then only when they are led to believe that animals are necessary and they do not suffer. NEAVS’ work shows that animals are in fact not necessary and they do indeed suffer and die.
Humane science is su­perior science. Ethical research benefits not only animals, but humans too.

Leading cancer research centers team up to launch biotech startup focused on cancer immunotherapy














NEW YORK and SEATTLE (Dec. 4, 2013) – The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), along with pediatric partner Seattle Children’s Research Institute, have joined forces to launch Juno Therapeutics Inc., a new biotechnology company focused on bringing forward novel immunotherapies for cancer.








Juno is being launched with an initial investment of $120M, making it one of the largest Series A biotech startups in history. Initial investors include leading technology venture capital firm ARCH Venture Partners and the Alaska Permanent Fund, through a partnership managed by Crestline Investors. Chief Executive Officer Hans Bishop, a longtime biotech industry veteran, will lead the company.
Commenting on the launch of Juno, Larry Corey, M.D., president and director of Fred Hutch, said, “The longtime research investment that centers like the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering have had in tumor immunology has allowed us to progress to where we feel we can genetically engineer smart T cells to eradicate malignant cancer cells and provide meaningful clinical remissions. Joining together allows us to bring some of the world’s most accomplished immunotherapy researchers to catalyze this field.”
José Baselga, M.D., Ph.D., physician-in-chief at MSKCC, said, "Based on the significant anti-tumor activity seen with this T-cell engineering technology, we are pursuing an aggressive and comprehensive clinical development plan to accelerate achievement of regulatory requirements and make this therapy available to cancer patients in the shortest period of time possible."
Robert Nelsen, ARCH co-founder and managing director and Juno co-founder, said, “The initial data from the clinical trials conducted by the scientific founders to date points toward the strong potential for this team to bring forward a broad pipeline of immunotherapy products that will transform how we treat cancer.”
Michael Burns, executive director of Alaska Permanent Fund, added, “Juno presents a compelling opportunity to partner with a sophisticated management team and group of world-class research institutions who share our long-term perspective. At a time when public financing for clinical development has largely dried up, the private-sector model is critical to allowing ventures like Juno to push the frontiers of research.”
Juno’s approach focuses on harnessing the power of the immune system through the reprogramming of a type of immune cell called T lymphocytes (“T cells”). T cells are part of the body’s natural protective defense system against infection, and Juno’s technology reprograms T cells to recognize cancer cells for a precision immunologic attack. Using synthetic receptors and/or augmented natural antigen receptors, Juno’s T cell reprogramming technologies enable the creation of a powerful anti-tumor immune response built from the patient’s own immune system. This transformative approach has the potential to induce long-term remissions and reduce or eliminate the need for debilitating surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
"The tumor regressions we are seeing across our Phase I trials at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Fred Hutch and Seattle Children’s Research Institute are unprecedented," said Michael Jensen, M.D., director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and a scientific co-founder of Juno. "I believe this is a transformative therapeutic platform for patients young and old that has the potential to save lives."
Richard Klausner, M.D., co-founder of Juno and former director of the National Cancer Institute, added, “In more than 30 years of immunotherapy research, this is the most exciting data I’ve seen—a complete molecular response in clinical trial patients.”

Juno’s partner organizations and founding scientists are:


Fred Hutch: Phil Greenberg, M.D., head of the Immunology Program and member, Clinical Research Division; Stanley Riddell, M.D., member, Clinical Research Division.

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center: Renier J. Brentjens, M.D., Ph.D., medical oncologist and associate chair for Cellular Therapy Trials; Isabelle Rivière, Ph.D., director of the Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility; and Michel Sadelain, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Cell Engineering.

Seattle Children’s Research Institute: Michael Jensen, M.D., director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research.

Juno’s co-founders are:

Hans Bishop, CEO of Juno and former executive vice president and chief operating officer of Dendreon Corporation;

Larry Corey, M.D., president and director of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center;

Richard Klausner, M.D., former director of the National Cancer Institute; and

Robert Nelsen, co-founder and a managing director of ARCH Venture Partners.

Juno CEO Hans Bishop noted, “Juno brings together renowned scientists and exceptional investment partners to launch and quickly scale an enterprise that will deliver cutting-edge cancer immunotherapy. It is a completely unique opportunity that holds the potential to truly save lives while transforming how we treat cancer.”

About Juno
Juno is a clinical stage company that brings together three of the world’s leading cancer centers – Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children’s Research Institute – in unique partnership to advance a broad pipeline of potential curative immunotherapy treatments. With one of the largest ever Series A investments for a biotech startup, Juno will build on breakthroughs in the design of novel immunotherapies to develop two distinct and complementary platforms – chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs). The CAR technology is designed to target cell surface antigens that are expressed on cancer cells. In addition, the high-affinity TCR technology can also detect alterations in intracellular proteins present in tumor cells. These treatments reduce longer-term toxicities associated with current chemotherapeutics and provide the potential for curative therapy even for patients with widespread disease. Juno’s goal is to drive multiple product candidates in select hematologic and solid tumor cancers to FDA licensure. Each candidate has the potential to treat a variety of high-risk cancers.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Secrets to Choosing Sectional Sofas



About Sofas

A sofa is a large piece of furniture and anchoring element in even the most cavernous living room or family room, so it’s always important to select just the right one for your needs and style. Luckily, there are quite a few different sofa options and configurations from which to choose:
Sectional sofas are modular couches that come in multiple sections. These can often be modified as needed to offer a variety of different seating arrangements. Sectional sofas tend to be very large, and can offer seating for up to eight or more people.
Sofas and loveseats are the most common design among this type of furniture. A full-length sofa usually seats at least three people, and is a comfortable and spacious option for most living rooms. In contrast, loveseats are a compact couch design that typically accommodates just two people. These are frequently used in smaller spaces or as part of a larger seating group. Together, couches and loveseats can provide plenty of comfortable seating to make for a functional living space.
Sofa beds and futons are both multi-taskers that can serve as either a sofa or a sleeping space. While both are classified as sleeper sofas, the primary difference between them is the way in which they convert into a bed. A futon folds flat so that the whole piece becomes the bed, while a sofa bed (also sometimes called a hide-a-bed) has a fold-out bed tucked inside the body of the couch.
Whether you opt for a hide-a-bed, an expansive sectional or a modern futon, you’re sure to find the ideal furniture pieces in our great selection of high-end furniture!

A dining table is one of the core pieces of furniture that can help make a house a home. It’s more than just a place to sit and eat meals, it’s a centerpiece, a gathering place, and an anchoring piece of furniture that help you bring your loved ones together.


Dining tables come in a wide range of sizes and shapes to accommodate any household or gathering. We offer dining tables from petite café or pub tables that seat just 2, to expansive formal dining tables that can seat upwards of 10 or 12 people. We also carry many flexible options of expandable tables that feature either additional table space that folds out, or separate leaves that can be added in. In terms of shapes, we carry square, rectangular, oval, and round dining tables, as well as some more unusual options such as octagonal, half-moon, and even triangle shapes. And, of course, we offer all of these options in an array of different styles, from unique modern designs featuring unusual silhouettes and striking combinations of metal, glass, and wood, to classic designs in a spectrum of different stain hues. We also have many rustic styles that integrate distressed finishes or reclaimed wood. With our selection of over 1,500 different dining tables to choose from, you are sure to find many different options to add style and functionality to your home.


To complete the look of your dining room, coordinating chairs are usually are in order, so we also offer a great selection of dining chairs, with a huge range of options to complement whatever dining table you choose. Alternately, if you would prefer a pre-matched set, you might want to check out our dining sets for a complete coordinating dining room without any of the time or effort of matching pieces yourself.

About Living Room Tables

There are quite a few types of living room tables to choose from, including coffee tables, end tables, sofa tables, and tray tables. All of these are wonderful additions that add functionality and convenience to an often used space.


Coffee tables are typically the central spot to set a drink, keep magazines, or put your feet up in a living room. They can be versatile pieces that hold just about anything, and usually sit directly in front of the sofa or seating group for easy access. Coffee tables come in an enormous range of styles including convertible and adjustable table configurations, storage ottomans, tables with shelves and drawers, and unique and innovative designs.
        

End tables are functional accent pieces that frequently hold lamps, remotes, and any snacks or drinks that someone sitting on the furniture may be enjoying. There are a wide variety of end table designs ranging from sleek and ultra-modern, to rustic carved wood or industrial chic designs. There are also nesting tables, which are a convenient option that are designed to nestle one underneath another for easy storage. Nesting tables can help add functionality and usable space, while also ensuring that a space have a clean tidy appearance when the tables are tucked away.
        

Sofa tables, also sometimes called console tables, are another helpful type of living room tables. A sofa table is a long and narrow table that is intended to be positioned against the back of a sofa, whether between the sofa and a wall, or out in the middle of a room. This puts the table in a perfect position to hold lamps and decorative items, and creates a readily available space for sofa users to set down a drink or TV remotes.
        

Tray tables can function as accent tables or can be used as TV trays for eating meals while enjoying a movie or sporting event on TV. Some tray tables even have detachable trays to give them more versatility and allow them to be used as serving accessories.

An accent chair is a stand-out addition that is meant to accentuate the style of the rest of a room’s furniture through striking contrast in fashion or design. Although this type of seating is frequently set apart by its bold colors or interesting patterns, an accent chair can just as easily be a centerpiece because of larger size, differing material, varied level of formality, or striking structural elements.

Accent chairs can come in just about any style, shape, or material you can think of, offering plenty of opportunity to add a one-of-a-kind look to your room. themine.com carries large chairs with arms, parsons chairs, club chairs, and unique modern designs, among many others. Whether your space needs a pair of traditional accent chairs, a contemporary chevron patterned piece, or a retro leather arm chair, with over 2,000 different options to choose from, there are choices to fit any design taste or color pallet.


When deciding which of these options might be right for your space, some factors to consider include the size of your space and the function you would like the chair to serve. When thinking about the size of your area, you want to ensure that the accent chair you choose is proportional to the room and the other furniture in the space, so that it neither dominates nor gets lost in the overall design. In larger spaces you may even want to add more than one accent chair to give the arrangement a balanced feel. In terms of function, these seats are a flexible option that can be at home in just about any room of the house due to their varied designs and sizes. One could serve as part of a reading nook in a bedroom, an extra chair in a home office, a décor element in a formal dining room, or even a stylistic accessory in a transitional space such as a hallway or entryway. When picking the style based on use, you may want to consider the comfort level and formality of different chairs to make sure they work for the space.
