Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

Glyphosate, a broad spectrum herbicide widely used in agriculture all over the world, inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the shikimate pathway, and glycine oxidase (GO) has been reported to be able to catalyze the oxidative deamination of various amines and cleave the C-N bond in glyphosate (Pedotti et al., 2009). Here, in an effort to improve the catalytic activity of the glycine oxidase that was cloned from a glyphosate-degrading marine strain of Bacillus cereus (BceGO), we used a bacteriophage T7 lysis-based method for high-throughput screening of oxidase activity and engineered the gene encoding BceGO by directed evolution.

[Abstract]
                               Glyphosate, a broad spectrum herbicide widely used in agriculture all over the world, inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the shikimate pathway, and glycine oxidase (GO) has been reported to be able to catalyze the oxidative deamination of various amines and cleave the C-N bond in glyphosate (Pedotti et al., 2009). Here, in an effort to improve the catalytic activity of the glycine oxidase that was cloned from a glyphosate-degrading marine strain of Bacillus cereus (BceGO), we used a bacteriophage T7 lysis-based method for high-throughput screening of oxidase activity and engineered the gene encoding BceGO by directed evolution.

		Screening
		

				The resulting library of BceGO mutants were expressed into 96 deep-well 
plates (containing 0.6 ml Luria-Bertani medium) and transferred onto 
Luria-Bertani agar plates as corresponding copies, followed by an 
overnight growth (37 °C, 300 rpm). 


				When the cultures grew to 
saturation, both IPTG (at a final concentration of 0.1 mM) and the 
bacteriophage T7 (above 100 particles per cell) were added into 96 
deep-well plates to synchronize the induction of recombinant mutants 
with the release of the lysis of the host E.coli DH5α at 37 °C with 
shaking for 6 h.


				The enzyme-coupled colorimetric assay (200 µl) was performed as follows:
159 µl of lysis cell extracts
20 µl of 50 mM glyphosate (at a decreasing substrate concentration gradient in sequential rounds of screening system)
20 µl of 0.32 mg/ml o-dianisidine dihydrochloride
1 µl of 5 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase 
Then incubated at 25 °C for 8 h


				The absorbance change at 450 nm for each well in the microtiter 
plates was measured and compared with the control (harboring wild-type 
BceGO or containing the empty vector pGEX-6P-1). Mutants that 
outperformed the wild-type were chosen for further activity analysis 
(Figure 1).

	Especially, B3S1 demonstrated a 160-fold increase in substrate affinity for glyphosate, a 326-fold increase in catalytic efficiency towards glyphosate and a significant enhancement in the specificity constant over the wild-type BceGO, achieving the goal of efficient oxidation of glyphosate by evolution of glycine oxidase.


	Notes



		The error-rate is controlled by varying the amount of MnCl2 and unblanced dNTPs added to the error-prone PCR reaction. 


		Design nested primer to amplify the parental genes for the DNA fragmentation and full-length sequences from reassembly products.



	Recipes



		Luria-Bertani medium
10 g/L tryptone 
5 g/L yeast extract 
10 g/L NaCl
Ampicillin (50 mg/L) was added as needed.

Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research

•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees

So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

Successful Inventions
Below are just some of the products that we have successfully licensed or commercialized on behalf of our clients. This sampling of products highlights some of the many industries that we work in.


 



Featured Licensed Product
 
 
 


Instant Trainer
L&L Licenses Pet Invention to As Seen on TV Marketer
Invented by Terry Silva 
The story of Terry Silva’s invention had a painful beginning.  After being dragged across the street, causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room, Terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her  110 pound German Shepherd-Alaskan Husky, named Ziggy.
“I went to the Dollar Store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen,” said Silva.  “I was pleasantly surprised when it worked, so I had a sturdier one made that my dog Ziggy loved!  He walked by my side and I never had to put any pressure on the new leash.” Like most inventors who develop their invention, Terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option.
That’s when she reached out to Lambert & Lambert to help her design and market her new invention, make presentations, and negotiate the license deal.  “Working with Lambert & Lambert has been a pleasure.  They are true professionals and I couldn’t have done it without them.”

Product QuickStart Services
We are here to provide as much, or as little support as you need.








Strategic Advisory Session


$250 +
Can your product be manufactured?  What can be improved?  If you're not sure what the next step is on the path toward a product launch, or if you just want to bounce some ideas off experienced product launchers, a strategic advisory session might be the best first step.  We can spend as little, or as much time with you as you need to determine how or if to proceed.  In many cases, we can help clients streamline their project plans in just a few hours.
 






Idea Audit / Analysis


$1,500 +
A Product QuickStart audit package starts with an analysis of your product idea, concept, or prototype.  Our team will evaluate your program based on technical feasibility, development challenges, aesthetics, industrial design, and manufacturing options.  The report we create helps clients make an informed go/no-go decision about their program.
 












Product Success Plan


$2,000 +
Don't be surprised by downstream development costs or timelines.  Let Product QuickStart develop a custom project plan for your program, identifying significant milestones, stage-gates, and long lead time items and activities.  Project plans we develop serve as invaluable road maps for developing and manufacturing your product, and help keep you on track toward your product launch goals.
 






Product Visualization


$2,000 +
Product QuickStart adds substance, excitement, and depth to our clients' crowdfunding campaign and investor presentations. We provide CAD-based photo-realistic renderings to help you build the vision of what your product will achieve.  In this engagement, we also provide a strong framework of understanding of development costs, manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and development schedule so you know how much capital you need to raise, and how long before you will be shipping product.
 















Product Animation


$3,000 +
Sometimes a static image just isn't enough to communicate the full functionality or uniqueness of a new product.  That's why Product QuickStart offers a variety of product animation options.  Show your prospective customers and investors your product from every angle.  Demonstrate how your product works or how it assembles.  An animation can add a whole new depth of reality to your product concept.
 






Prototypes


Priced by Project
Many projects need a robust, demonstrable working prototype in order to attain funding for development and manufacturing ramp up.  Some crowdfunding portals, like Kickstarter, require product or technology based projects to have a working prototype to be eligible to raise funds.  Product QuickStart provides high quality prototype design, development, fabrication, and testing.  With our prototypes, clients have the opportunity to demonstrate their innovations in a very real, very powerful way.
 












Industrial Design


Priced by Project
Our Industrial Designers have worked on a broad range of projects, from medical equipment to cars.  We start with rapid hand visualization concepts and move quickly to 3D CAD models.  Our designers work closely with the engineers and manufacturing team to make sure what they develop is well thought out and has future manufacturing possibilities.
 






Engineering


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart engineers have experience developing products for many industries. They all have years of experience in the product development industry and are masters of working hand in hand with designers.  Our engineers well help bridge the gap between design and manufacturing to make the product development process as smooth as possible for you.

Product QuickStart builds robust supply chains for our clients through a network of hundreds of vetted, audited suppliers.  We manufacture product both domestically and offshore, and we are not tied to any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.  Being supplier-independent gives us the freedom to design your product and your supply chain around your needs, instead of steering you toward a factory that we need to fill to capacity.  We are masters of quality control and supply chain reliability.

Product QuickStart Services
We are here to provide as much, or as little support as you need.








Strategic Advisory Session


$250 +
Can your product be manufactured?  What can be improved?  If you're not sure what the next step is on the path toward a product launch, or if you just want to bounce some ideas off experienced product launchers, a strategic advisory session might be the best first step.  We can spend as little, or as much time with you as you need to determine how or if to proceed.  In many cases, we can help clients streamline their project plans in just a few hours.
 






Idea Audit / Analysis


$1,500 +
A Product QuickStart audit package starts with an analysis of your product idea, concept, or prototype.  Our team will evaluate your program based on technical feasibility, development challenges, aesthetics, industrial design, and manufacturing options.  The report we create helps clients make an informed go/no-go decision about their program.
 












Product Success Plan


$2,000 +
Don't be surprised by downstream development costs or timelines.  Let Product QuickStart develop a custom project plan for your program, identifying significant milestones, stage-gates, and long lead time items and activities.  Project plans we develop serve as invaluable road maps for developing and manufacturing your product, and help keep you on track toward your product launch goals.
 






Product Visualization


$2,000 +
Product QuickStart adds substance, excitement, and depth to our clients' crowdfunding campaign and investor presentations. We provide CAD-based photo-realistic renderings to help you build the vision of what your product will achieve.  In this engagement, we also provide a strong framework of understanding of development costs, manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and development schedule so you know how much capital you need to raise, and how long before you will be shipping product.
 















Product Animation


$3,000 +
Sometimes a static image just isn't enough to communicate the full functionality or uniqueness of a new product.  That's why Product QuickStart offers a variety of product animation options.  Show your prospective customers and investors your product from every angle.  Demonstrate how your product works or how it assembles.  An animation can add a whole new depth of reality to your product concept.
 






Prototypes


Priced by Project
Many projects need a robust, demonstrable working prototype in order to attain funding for development and manufacturing ramp up.  Some crowdfunding portals, like Kickstarter, require product or technology based projects to have a working prototype to be eligible to raise funds.  Product QuickStart provides high quality prototype design, development, fabrication, and testing.  With our prototypes, clients have the opportunity to demonstrate their innovations in a very real, very powerful way.
 












Industrial Design


Priced by Project
Our Industrial Designers have worked on a broad range of projects, from medical equipment to cars.  We start with rapid hand visualization concepts and move quickly to 3D CAD models.  Our designers work closely with the engineers and manufacturing team to make sure what they develop is well thought out and has future manufacturing possibilities.
 






Engineering


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart engineers have experience developing products for many industries. They all have years of experience in the product development industry and are masters of working hand in hand with designers.  Our engineers well help bridge the gap between design and manufacturing to make the product development process as smooth as possible for you.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
