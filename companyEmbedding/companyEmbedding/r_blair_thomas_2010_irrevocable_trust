 3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust | How To Protect Your Assets             How To Protect Your Assets Menu       3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust Thinking about setting up an irrevocable trust? When it comes to setting up a trust, many don’t realize the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust. Before you sign on the dotted line, there are a few things you should know about irrevocable trusts.   You Give Up Your Rights with Irrevocable TrustsTo distinguish the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust, the name says it all. Once you set up a revocable trust, it’s not set in stone. Trustees can make changes to the trust during their lifetime at their discretion. If you change your mind about leaving your home and a million dollars to your ungrateful son, you can remove his name as beneficiary.With an irrevocable trust, once the grantor does the initial setup, the trustee takes over. That means you can’t go back and rewrite or remove the terms of the trust. Even if there is an exception, the trustee and all parties involved would have to agree to the changes. Even the beneficiaries would need to agree. That’s a hard pill to swallow about assets you once owned.Irrevocable Trusts Are Beneficial Tools for Estate PlanningYou might be wondering why you’d want to get involved in a trust that’s so final. Irrevocable trusts have some nice tax benefits for estate purposes. You’re able to place some property within the trust to reduce the taxable value. Some assets are also sheltered from estate taxes at the time of the grantor’s death and distribution.   There are some other pros to no longer having ownership of assets in an irrevocable trust. In the event of issues with creditors, it protects your estate. Since the assets belong to the trustee after setup, creditors can’t seize assets to reconcile outstanding debts. Even in the case of a bankruptcy, the assets will stay put in the irrevocable trust.Irrevocable Trusts Require MaintenanceIt may not be as simple as you think to setup an irrevocable trust. The process is more than just a one-time setup. Irrevocable trusts require upfront and continuous fees for maintenance and to pay staff. The least expensive trust will cost a few thousand dollars to setup. You’ll also have to pay a trust attorney to make sure the trust is organized correctly with the most benefits.Deciding whether to set up an irrevocable trust all boils down to what you need it to do for you. In the end, even revocable trusts transition to irrevocable. After the death of the grantor, no one can make changes to the terms. The decision depends on if you want to have control and flexibility during your lifetime or the tax benefits to work for everyone now and later.
