Good stuff on this app, Very up to date. Only thing I noticed was the connections are limited. I know this is a lot of work to get it all going but it could use more businesses I have several things there's no hookup for. For example gamefly just for one. Also if you can't do it connection wise it would help if there was a manual input of a recurring fee. Just to keep track. I may be off base though. Good stuff though, keep it going.   Full Review       FileThis Inc. April 21, 2015  Hey Justin, Thanks for the nice review. You can actually forward emails and documents to your FileThis account. Use your personal FileThis email address under settings. And, we are also adding more connections :)                  Chris Olonzo  February 18, 2015                        Great Service.  Buggy App FileThis is a fantastic service.  If they could work out the (many) bugs in the app, I'd give it 5 stars.  As it stands,  you can work around the bugs by simply using the web app. Really guys, the Android app sucks.  One of the buggiest apps I've ever used. Shame...   Full Review       FileThis Inc.

Spent more time looking for HELP than actually using the app.  Why would I buy it if I haven't had the opportunity to successfully try it out? I got stuck in a cycle when adding an account they kept asking me for answer to a security question that was not my question so I didn't have an answer.   Full Review       FileThis Inc.

My biggest complaint with the service is that if you use a credit union or local bank you are going to be pretty much out of luck connecting. I'm not sure why. If Mint can do it why can't FileThis?

The app is pretty sluggish even on a Nexus 6, absolutely no thought given to the material design guidelines, and an outrageous subscription rate.   Full Review       FileThis Inc.

Tyler Hilliard  August 25, 2015                         Could use a MUCH cleaner UI/UX.  Don't expect EVERYTHING to be available or quickly added, they have not added one of the dozen services I have suggested in over six months. Support is rude. Have been no design improvements in the time I have used it.  Support is technically 'available' as they have responded but shuts down any sort of suggestions and denies any bugs so pretty useless. Uses flash.   Full Review       FileThis Inc. September 18, 2015  Hi Tyler, thanks for your feedback.

I love to be able to have all my bills in one place. Thank you for responding and fixing my problem! Great customer service! I want to upgrade to the unlimited connection...but the other billers I have are not on your list. Is there a way to add billers manually?

The only change I would like to see is how they list the statements. It pulls 12 months of statements and list the oldest first. I opened the first statement listed. It's a year old. I panic, nothing on there is even close to the statement from the present month. I contacted support and was amazed to get an answer back in hours not days like most support. This app is a keeper.

Unreliable Service

    This service is able to download a good percentage of my monthly bills. I pay extra for the extra connections, but for the past month, I am having trouble looking past their many hiccups, to the point that it has become unreliable. As part of the service, you are able to send via email, any file you want to add to the account. I have been having intermittent problems with this, they finally fixed it and that lasted a whopping 2 days. Now I am back to having problems and there is no prompt response from the developers to address the situation. When a fix did get made, I only got the new files I emailed me, the old ones I sent got lost. That is a major problem for me. Today, I was attempting to move files from one account to another and they simply disappeared! Their search function is appalling.  If I search for credit cards, 2016, Chase, I will get all my credit cards, all that has a 2016 relevant dates and all of the Chase  tagged items. I should only be getting the items that meet all 3 criteria. I want to love this service, it is a true time saver, but they still have ways to go before it becomes reliable. They need to be proactive in fixing their numerous problems. I would also like to have a field to add notes/comments to the files.
  



Excellent service! Worth paying for!!

    I love this service! Connects to almost all of my banks, credit cards, utilities, insurance, etc accounts and pulls the PDFs into my Evernote. I pay extra for more connections and it's worth it. I have needed easy access to statements so many times. Before this service it was a pain to find them on individual websites or the website no longer had older statements. I can trust that all of my statements are archived in my own system. I login from time to time to make sure all connections are working. Sometimes a bank or company will update their security settings and FileThis will have to reconnect. But it's so easy!!!
  



Great concept, product

    I gave up on Mint and Mint Bills after Intuit essentially kept messing with them so much that they're below par for me. FileThis does something I've been dying for a service to do, and that's download all of the paperwork from accounts automatically; this is a giant time saver and extremely useful to have as an easy-to-access backup. The built-in bill pay calendar I love, although I second another reviewer's desire for an iCal implementation. The biggest downside right now is the limited companies that are available to sign in to, and again, per another user, it's be awesome to see health insurance companies be a part of this. That being said, it's not entirely on FileThis for that shortcoming.

FileThis is a service that collects online statements and makes them available to you in one place via cloud storage or locally on your computer.  The FileThis Fetch app works well with many online financial institutions such as banks and moneylenders as well as merchants and service companies.  Whether you want to stay on top of personal finance or manage small business expenses, FileThis Fetch might suit your needs.
After the installation, you will be required to create a FileThis account.  The free service allows up to six free connections (statements) with a paid premium option of $5/month for 30 connections. To create a connection, just press the "+" icon and search for the company/bank/retailer that you would like to access.  The app currently supports more than 300 institutions (with more on the way), from popular banks such as Bank of America and Chase to online merchants like Amazon, and even Utility companies like AT&T. Your account info. is needed plus a verification process must be passed (e-mail, phone number check) to start a connection.  The final step is to create a destination to deposit all of your digital statements.  You can choose from a variety of cloud services like DropBox, Google Drive, or Evernote. FileThis Fetch will then gather as many statements as it can find and converts it neatly into a PDF, accessible from your destination of choice.  After this initial setup, FileThis Fetch becomes mostly hands-off and will automatically fetch your documents.
The app performed well during our test and only had a minor hiccup when it came to Amazon but that was quickly remedied by the development team.  Syncing is almost instantaneous and FileThis Fetch was able to pull even the oldest statements we had available from Amazon.  The interface is a little bland but mostly created to be functional; you won't see any distracting design elements here.  We also hope that future updates will allow multiple destinations instead of just one. The core functionality of the mobile works well with its desktop counterpart.  FileThis Fetch may be ideal for small business owners keeping track of expenses, or students managing loans, or just about anyone trying to stay on top of their finances.

FileThis Pro saves you and your clients hours every week by checking for new online documents from their online accounts. FileThis is like a personal assistant that fetches all your documents on a reliable schedule. Now you can help getting your clients organized in minutes and getting your work done. 


Find what matters!
FileThis Pro stores bills, statements, and other files as searchable PDF files and names them clearly by institution, account number, and date. This makes it easy to track back over the early part of the year for deductible expenses or other transactions. Spend less time on managing paperwork. Let FileThis do it for you.


































FileThis Pro – Winner of the 12th Tax & Accounting Technology Award 2015






“Successful business leaders and their accounting professionals are increasingly turning to cloud-based solutions to help achieve greater productivity and profitability, both more necessary than ever in today's competitive environment. The winners of the 12th annual Tax & Accounting Technology Innovation Awards, all cloud-based solutions, are examples of this new reality of on-demand information and business agility.” – Isaac M. O'Bannon, CPA Practice Advisor








“Most often, it’s not the giant changes in technology that have a major impact on practitioners. In fact, more often, it’s the smaller, thoughtful advances that are the game changers…and FileThis is a game changer. This unique technology, designed for accounting professionals, solves a major pain point because it automates the time-consuming, manual process of collecting financial documents from clients. This adds up to major time savings, and that is always a big deal to practitioners.” – Darren Root, CPA, CITP, CGMA, and CEO of RootWorks LLC.








Invite and connect
Invite your clients to FileThis. With FileThis they get a digital file cabinet that lets them connect all their financial and household accounts. We support over 450 institutions in the US!



You relax – we fetch
FileThis goes out and automatically fetches online statements. The first time a client connects  an account, we collect up to three years worth of documents – and every new document that becomes available in the future. 



Where do you want it?
By default FileThis delivers all documents to the secure FileThis Cloud. But you can also decide if your client's documents should rather go to Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or soon SmartVault. You name it!














Your Workflow
FileThis Pro supports your workflow. Whether you are using a client portal like SmartVault or cloud based solutions like Cloud9, Xero, or QuickBooks to manage your client documents doesn't matter to us. FileThis Pro simply provides an automated way to collect client documents instead of receiving them via email, snail mail, fax, or not at all because your client can't find them. 



  Your Team
Your team uses the modern FileThis Pro Administration Console to manage their clients: Here they can invite clients to FileThis, see connected client accounts, access shared documents, and communicate directly with their clients. Don't have a big team? No worries, we have a plan for everyone: From sole proprietors to mid-sized and large firms.







Bank-Level Security
We’ve adopted the same security standards used by FDIC-insured banks. This includes encrypting documents with the 256-bit AES standard, encrypting connections with 256-bit SSL, and locating our servers in physically patrolled data facilities in the U.S. 


 Accolades
 Named by TIME Magazine as one of the “50 Best Websites of 2014” and a Macworld “Best of Show 2012” winner, FileThis is an award winning service that safely fetches and organizes important documents, including bills, bank statements, medical records, insurance policies, and more, eliminating paper waste and the need for a filing cabinet. 











 From our community:





A fantastic product for us to use!

This product is a joy and a wonder!

This is a game changer!
