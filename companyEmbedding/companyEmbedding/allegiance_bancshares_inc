Record core loan growth of $363.0 million, or 21.6%, year over year and $118.8 million, or 24.7% (annualized), for the second quarter 2017 compared to the linked quarterNet interest income increased 14.4% year over year and 4.1% for the second quarter 2017 compared to the linked quarterEfficiency ratio decreased to 61.92% for the second quarter 2017 from 64.98% for the first quarter 2017 HOUSTON, July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABTX) ("Allegiance"), the holding company of Allegiance Bank (the "Bank"), today reported net income of $5.4 million in the second quarter 2017 compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter 2016 and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2017 and 2016 of $0.40. "We are extremely proud to report another record quarter of high-quality organic loan production," commented George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our linked second quarter core loan growth of $118.8 million represents an annualized increase of 24.7% and reflects the hard work and dedication of our talented team of legacy lenders who, in collaboration with our recently added lenders, continue to build strong relationships in the vibrant Houston market. At the same time, our asset quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs of 0.13%, which reflects our disciplined underwriting," continued Martinez. "In addition to enhancing our lending team, we have hired key personnel to strengthen our infrastructure and support the operational and regulatory requirements applicable to a larger bank as we pursue our ambitious growth goals. While net income declined in the second quarter 2017 compared to the linked quarter, primarily due to an increased provision for loan loss expense as a result of robust loan growth and prior nonperforming credit relationships, we are pleased to see gains in both efficiency and pre-tax pre-provision earnings in our second quarter 2017 performance,” concluded Martinez. Second Quarter 2017 Results Net interest income before provision for loan losses in the second quarter 2017 increased $3.2 million, or 14.4%, to $25.1 million from $21.9 million for the second quarter 2016 primarily due to organic loan growth and an increase in our securities portfolio.  Net interest income before provision for loan losses in the second quarter 2017 increased $979 thousand, or 4.1%, from $24.1 million in the first quarter 2017.  The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased 3 basis points to 4.29% for the second quarter 2017 from 4.32% for the second quarter 2016 and decreased 9 basis points from 4.38% for the first quarter 2017. Noninterest income for the second quarter 2017 was $1.5 million, an increase of $265 thousand, or 21.9%, compared to $1.2 million for the second quarter 2016 and an increase of $136 thousand, or 10.1%, compared to $1.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2017 increased $2.5 million, or 18.2%, to $16.5 million from $13.9 million for the second quarter 2016, and decreased $88 thousand, or 0.5%, from $16.5 million for the first quarter 2017. The increase in noninterest expense over the second quarter 2016 was primarily due to increased professional service fees to support growth initiatives. In the second quarter 2017, Allegiance’s efficiency ratio decreased to 61.92% from 64.98% for the first quarter 2017 and increased from 60.11% for the second quarter 2016. Second quarter 2017 annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity were 0.81%, 7.32% and 8.57%, respectively, compared to 0.91%, 7.79% and 9.30%, respectively, for the second quarter 2016.  Annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity for the first quarter 2017 were 0.96%, 8.61% and 10.15%, respectively. Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Results Net interest income before provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased $6.2 million, or 14.4%, to $49.2 million from $43.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to organic loan growth and an increase in our securities portfolio.  The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased 5 basis points to 4.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from 4.38% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 37.6%, compared to $4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The six months ended June 30, 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $2.1 million on the sale of two Central Texas branch locations that were sold in order to focus on the Houston MSA. Excluding the gain on the sale of these branches, noninterest income would have increased $352 thousand, or 14.3%, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Noninterest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased $4.8 million, or 17.2%, to $33.0 million from $28.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The increase in noninterest expense over the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of the increased headcount and professional service fees related to supporting growth initiatives. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, Allegiance’s efficiency ratio increased to 63.41% from 61.93% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity were 0.89%, 7.95% and 9.34%, respectively, compared to 1.04%, 8.74% and 10.46%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding the gain on the sale of the two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016, the annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 would have been 0.92%, 7.73% and 9.26%, respectively. Financial Condition Total loans at June 30, 2017 increased $361.0 million, or 20.6%, to $2.11 billion compared to $1.75 billion at June 30, 2016 and increased $128.2 million, or 6.5%, compared to $1.99 billion at March 31, 2017. These increases were due to strong organic loan growth within the Bank’s loan portfolio. Core loans, which exclude the mortgage warehouse portfolio, increased $363.0 million, or 21.6%, to $2.04 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.68 billion at June 30, 2016 and increased $118.8 million, or 6.2%, from $1.92 billion at March 31, 2017.

Reconciliation and Management’s Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures(Unaudited) Allegiance’s management uses certain non−GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance.  Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance’s performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.   Three Months Ended Year-to-Date  2017 2016 2017 2016   June 30  March 31  December 31  September 30  June 30  June 30  June 30                               (Dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data)               Total shareholders' equity $298,459  $289,130  $279,817  $281,095  $276,251  $298,459  $276,251 Less:  Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 43,054  43,249  43,444  43,639  43,835  43,054  43,835 Tangible shareholders’ equity $255,405  $245,881  $236,373  $237,456  $232,416  $255,405  $232,416                Shares outstanding at end of period 13,153  13,080  12,958  12,905  12,869  13,153  12,869                Tangible book value per share $19.42  $18.80  $18.24  $18.40  $18.06  $19.42  $18.06                Net income attributable to shareholders $5,395  $6,047  $5,771  $5,471  $5,254  $11,442  $11,609                Average shareholders' equity $295,524  $284,889  $278,123  $280,065  $271,128  $290,236  $267,263 Less:  Average goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 43,149  43,345  43,539  43,735  43,930  43,246  44,124 Average tangible shareholders’ equity $252,375  $241,544  $234,584  $236,330  $227,198  $246,990  $223,139                Return on average tangible equity 8.57% 10.15% 9.79% 9.21% 9.30% 9.34% 10.46%               Total assets $2,724,716  $2,592,330  $2,450,948  $2,461,902  $2,367,581  $2,724,716  $2,367,581 Less: Goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net 43,054  43,249  43,444  43,639  43,835  43,054  43,835 Tangible assets $2,681,662  $2,549,081  $2,407,504  $2,418,263  $2,323,746  $2,681,662  $2,323,746                Tangible equity to tangible assets 9.52% 9.65% 9.82% 9.82% 10.00% 9.52% 10.00%                      Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
