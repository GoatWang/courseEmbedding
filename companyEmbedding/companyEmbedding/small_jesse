Love these shoes! My feet are slim/narrow and these shoes still fit on the tightest adjustment! Thanks Dansko! My search for navy shoes came to an end when I found these Pewter ones! Pewter goes with MANY COLORS! Narrow Navy shoes are non existant anyway! You will not be disappointed with these shoes. I live in Sophie, Jessie, Joanie, and professional clog! All are adjustable for my narrow feet except for the clog.....and that one is professional narrow! Thanks Dansko!

The professional platform upon which Jessie is built is perfect for my high-arched feet. My only complaint with this particular Dansko shoe style is that the cushioning squeaks when I walk.

Love this Dansko so much better than the Sophie! Fit is better and support is better! With the Sophie, my big toe was a bit over the edge of my regular size -- but with the Jessie I don't have that problem -- fits perfect!

Love these sandals! 6 years ago I was diagnosed with painful plantar fasciitis and had to wear orthotics in my shoes. Then I discovered Danskos! Since I've been wearing this brand (over 3 years now), my feet are supported, comfortable, cushioned and completely pain free! I know they may not work this well for everyone, but if you want a stylish, comfortable sandal, give Danskos a try.
I'd also recommend:  Olukai Sandals

These were perfect straight out of the box. My offie work shoe for summer - dressy but comfortable for the half mile walk to and from the train station.

Awesome Dansko sandal! It is a true size. I wear a consistent 37 in Dansko and this fit perfect. It is so comfortable. I love the adjustable buckle. And as always, the footbed is the perfect thing for my plantar fasciitis.
