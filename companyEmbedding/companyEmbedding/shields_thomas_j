Guiding aspiring spiritually oriented professionals to refocus and see themselves
 in the best light, so they can be their best, live their best, and give their best.

Dear Aspiring Professional:

I don’t know where you’re at right now in your work and life, so I’m wondering if any of the following descriptions might shed some light on your situation.

Maybe you’re still trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up, that right work that you can be best at, that fulfills your sense of purpose, fuels your passion, optimizes your strengths (talents, knowledge, skills) and maximizes your potential, performance, productivity and pay.

Maybe you’ve been in your right work, but have lost sight of your vision and are feeling burned out, bored or disconnected from the deeper purpose of your work. Something is missing, but you just can’t see what that could be.

Maybe you’re winning professionally, but feel like you’re losing personally. If you’ve become overly identified with your work, fame or fortune, your professional role can take over your identity leading you to lose yourself in the process. You also may have been led to believe that balance is a myth, just not possible to attain.

Maybe you’ve arrived! You’re highly accomplished and regarded, well respected in your profession, field, industry, while also living well, enjoying a quality work-life balance, yet you’re wondering and asking “what’s next?” You could certainly be content to live your life in a more relaxed fashion or you could refocus and turn your success into a greater opportunity and vision for sharing your success and wisdom with others, inspiring and empowering them to be, to live and to give their best.

Wherever you may be in your work and life, the bottom line is this, the world needs you to be your best, live your best, and give your best, bringing your light to life and your life to light. We need more light in this world!

 Hi, I’m Thomas J Shields,  founder of the Optimal Vision Institute ™ working as an Optimal Vision Coach, otherwise known as “The Optimalogist”. I coach leaders in healthcare, business, sports, education and various other fields who....


✦feel like there’s something missing in their life regardless of how successful they may be or have been.


✦want to win professionally without losing personally.


✦have a vision and sense of purpose for creating something much bigger than themselves.


   
I’ve helped hundreds of people in all areas of their life to refocus their lives, build their inner strength and maximize their potential and balance while reconnecting with the core of who they are, that authentic Self within.  
     
I am here to be a light for you, to show you your greatness, build your inner strength and help you to clear the way to seeing your truth.

You are capable of being far more than you may be currently demonstrating, and doing so in a healthy, balanced, authentic, fulfilling way. 

How do you get there?
1. Subscribe to my weekly blog, where I provide perspective and insights to inspire you and give you practical ways to enhance the quality of your life. 2. Subscribe to my monthly newsletter/ezine, REFOCUS


At this point you may be thinking to yourself, “ this sounds great or at least interesting, but can he really help me with my particular situation?
