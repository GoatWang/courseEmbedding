LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.

If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

How to Transfer Ownership of an LLC



                  by            
                  Jane Haskins, Esq.
Freelance writer                



How to Transfer Ownership of an LLC
by Jane Haskins, Esq., September 2014





Many limited liability companies have a change in ownership at some point during the life of the business.
Ownership changes happen for a variety of reasons, including:
A member decides to leave the company
The existing members want to bring in a new member
A member dies, becomes disabled or divorces
You decide sell the entire business
The procedure to transfer LLC ownership depends on whether you’re transferring the whole business or only changing the names and percentage ownerships of the members—such as when you take on a new member or buy out a departing member.
Transferring a Partial Interest in the LLC
Your LLC’s owners are called members. Each member owns a percentage of the business, which is known as a membership interest. If you want to change the percentage of ownership or add new members, you will need to transfer some of your LLC’s membership interests.
They key document that will guide you in how to transfer ownership in an LLC is your LLC operating agreement.
You most likely signed an operating agreement when you set up your LLC. The operating agreement is a contract among the LLC’s members that specifies the way the LLC will operate. If it includes buy-sell or buyout provisions, those will govern the way you transfer ownership. Alternatively, your LLC may have a separate buy-sell agreement.
The buy-sell provisions will typically specify a method for placing a value on the business and its membership interests. They also might place restrictions on who becomes a member, require the LLC to buy back shares from a departing member, or specify what needs to be done to approve a transfer.
If your operating agreement does not include a buy-sell agreement, you should check your state statutes for guidance on how to transfer membership interests. You may be able to negotiate a buy-sell agreement or a written agreement to transfer ownership. In some states, you may have to dissolve the company if your operating agreement does not provide for ownership transfers. Since these actions can have long-term consequences for your business, it’s wise to consult with a lawyer.
This is also a good time to review your operating agreement and make sure it is relevant and meets your needs now that your membership is changing. For example, an operating agreement for a single-member LLC may be missing some provisions that are needed for a multi-member LLC.
If your old operating agreement seems inadequate, you should prepare and sign a new one that reflects the new ownership structure. If you don’t need a new agreement, you can prepare an amendment that lists the new members.
You typically don’t need to file anything with the state to finalize the ownership transfer, but you’ll want to list the current members as part of any annual reports you make to the state.
Selling an LLC
Despite its name, a buy-sell agreement doesn’t offer guidance on how to sell your entire business to a third party—it only governs the way the members will transfer their membership interests among themselves and new members.
To sell an LLC, you need to find a buyer and agree on a price. This may involve using the services of a business valuation expert, having the buyer examine your business’s books and records, or a combination of the two. A buyer may want to purchase the entire LLC or may only want to purchase its assets.
Selling an LLC can have complex financial, legal and tax implications, so it’s best to consult a lawyer who has experience with buying and selling LLCs.
The terms of the sale may initially be memorialized in a term sheet or memorandum of understanding, followed by a more formal contract.
It’s always best to plan ahead for LLC ownership transfers by including buy-sell provisions in your operating agreement. Buy-sell provisions can help a transfer go smoothly and avoid disruptions to your business. If you don’t have a buy-sell agreement, or if you want to sell your entire business, you may need to seek legal advice.
For questions or advice on transferring ownership of an LLC, you can talk to a lawyer through the LegalZoom business legal plan.

Products
The material handling industry utilizes ball transfers in their material conveying machinery. The advantage of these units over the common skate wheel or belt conveyor system is their ability to move in all directions. This feature makes them ideal for assembly lines that require product to make turns in the course of handling. They are also especially well suited for use at work stations, where they facilitate the rotation of heavy material in any direction. This eliminates the need for workers to lift or slide product to complete assembly work, providing equal access to all sides.
 
Today, Ball Transfer Systems, LLC manufactures over sixty different styles of ball transfers to meet the diverse needs of the material handling industry. Most units are constructed of carbon steel support cups holding approximately 80 1/8" carbon steel balls. On top of this base, a carbon steel retainer and 1" ball are placed then covered with either a simple cover or a flange-designed cover. For units requiring a mounting stud, the simple covered units are pressed into a stud cup with the appropriate size bolt protruding from the bottom. Variations to this configuration include larger main balls of 1 7/8" diameter, smaller main balls of 1/2" and 1" diameter, units made entirely of stainless steel, and customized bolt sizes based on customers' requests.

1.800.456.7999 We specialize in people over products












Live Transfer Phone Leads

Live transfer phone leads can be a great way to prospect by talking to people who are actively looking for insurance products and services, or by sending compelling outbound messages to prospects, and waiting for their request for more information.

Insurance Network America has partnered with two companies specializing in these types of leads.

When consumers go online and click ads, or enter insurance-related search terms to google, bing, or other search engines, they fill out request forms specific to the type of product they're interested in buying. That information is then processed and distributed based on agent-created profiles including geography and lifestyle filters. Another live transfer lead company sends thousands of outbound phone messages to their list, and when a prospect requests more information, that phone call is transferred directly to you!

Start now and wait for leads to come to you! Categories include leads for:


       •  Annuities (outgoing messages only)
       •  Health Insurance
       •  Life and LTC Insurance (outgoing messages only)
       •  Disability
       •  Business Benefits
       •  And more!

Contact your Marketing Specialist
today, click below, or call us at 1.800.456.7999 to see how easy it is
to start "warm internet lead" prospecting now!


> LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS LIVE PHONE TRANSFER LEADS
 
Insurance Network America is not affiliated with Concierge Services Vendors, nor do we guaranty the accuracy or quality of their services. Although we may promote and/or recommend the services
offered by this company, agents are ultimately responsible for the use of any materials or services and agree to comply with the compliance requirements of their broker/dealer and registered investment adviser (if applicable), and the insurance carriers they represent.

AT&T Sweeps All Categories to Take the Top Ranking  in J.D. Power Purchase Experience Full-Service Study


Mobility /  Dallas, Texas, Feb 16, 2017

Share






























AT&T Scored Higher Than the Industry Average and Closest Competitor, Taking the Award for the 8th Time in a Row 
AT&T1* swept all categories to take the top ranking in the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Wireless Purchase Experience Full-Service StudySM Volume 1, released today.2
We are the first carrier to rank highest in all 6 categories evaluated for the Purchase Experience Study. Categories include store sales rep, facility, website, phone sales rep, offerings and promotions and cost of service. This demonstrates the value that AT&T provides.
Today’s ranking marks the 8th time in a row AT&T has earned this award. We outscored the full-service industry average and our closest competitor by 14 points, according to the study.
“Customers have spoken. And we are thrilled with what they had to say,” said Glenn Lurie, president and CEO, AT&T Mobility and Consumer Operations. “Add that to our recent award for wireless customer care and that means we swept J.D. Power’s 2016 Volume 2 and 2017 Volume 1 Customer Care and Purchase Experience Studies among full service providers. Each of these consecutive studies measures a 6-month period.
“Simply put, this means AT&T is providing a great overall experience when you shop with us and when you need help with your service at any touchpoint!”
AT&T received top honors in J.D. Power’s Wireless Customer Care rankings released earlier this month – for the second time in a row.2
J.D. Power presents the Purchase Experience award twice a year. We have earned top honors in the last 8 studies, since 2013. The study took place from July to December 2016, with 8,058 U.S. wireless customers participating.
1*AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.
2AT&T received the highest number among providers in the J.D. Power 2013 Volume 2, 2014-2016 (V1 & V2), and 2017 Volume 1 U.S. Wireless Purchase Experience Full-Service Performance and 2016 (Vol. 2) and 2017 (Vol. 1) U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Studies. 2017 Vol 1 studies based on 8,058 (Purchase) and 8,135 (Customer Care) total responses, measuring the perceptions and experiences of current customers, surveyed July-December 2016.

Carolina Bulk Transfer LLC 910-371-0407
Carolina Bulk Transfer LLC is located in Leland, NC which is in Brunswick County.
There are approximately 17 Counties located in the 910 area code. Phone companies and telecommunication companies in this area may include the following: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Pacific Bell, Sprint
 It was established on November 14, 1993, as a split from area code 919.  Its creation came with some fanfare, as it was North Carolina's first new area code in 39 years.  Originally, it covered a fan-shaped region in the southeastern and east-central portions of the state.  This was a somewhat unusual configuration, as the two parts were only connected by a tendril in the Sandhills.  However, while southeastern North Carolina was not large enough at the time for its own area code, it was too large to stay in 919.
It was itself split on December 15, 1997, when area code 336 was created from most of the western portion (the Piedmont Triad).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
