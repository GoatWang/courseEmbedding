Welcome to Immuron Limited  http://www.immuron.com/  Immuron Ltd is a publicly listed Australian biopharmaceutical company focused on oral immunotherapy utilizing polyclonal antibody products that target the human gut immune system and gut microbiome. Immuron’s technology platform is capable of developing and producing an orally stable therapeutic as a potential ‘oral targeted therapy’ for various immune mediated and inflammatory disorders, among them: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diabetes, colitis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), liver fibrosis and other chronic disorders in which the immune system plays a key role in thier pathogenesis. These disorders represent areas of growing and unmet medical need, where oral targeted therapy drugs could offer significant advantages due to the lack of absorption and the high safety profile.  Immuron has one marketed product, which provides proof of concept for its Oral Immune Technology Platform, and a pipeline of products at various stages of clinical and earlier development. Immuron’s marketed product, Travelan, is for the prevention of travellers’ diarrhoea. Travelan is a non-absorbable, safe product which is composed of anti-bacterial antibodies that work on the gut immune system and gut microbiome. Travelan has been proven in Clinical studies to offer over 90% protection against Travellers' Diarrhoea and is therefore a major new breakthrough when travelling to high risk destinations. The product is licensed in Australia, in Canada, South African and Latin America, as well as a number of countries in South East Asia.  Immuron Limited Highlights Positive Phase I data for NASH with potential indication for Diabetes.  http://www.immuron.com/assets/Uploads/AASLD-Poster-2010-NASH-clinical-trial-final.pdf Currently two Phase II ongoing for NASH and ASH. ASH and Pediatric NASH trials are fully funded by NIH. Signed collaboration with US Army for Diarrhoea related products. Clinical Data readout for NASH Phase II is Mid-2017. Huge Market opportunity.               30 Billion for NASH.              1-2 Billion for ASH and              500 Million for Pediatric NASH (Phase II trial to Begin Third Qtr 2016).              Travelan Generates 1-2 million in revenue and could reach 30 Million in 4-5 years.               Travelan Launched in US, Canada and more recently in China. Partenering with CVS for distribution.  NASH companies have average market cap of 100-200 mil that are in phase II. With positive phase II data Market cap would be worth Billions of dollars.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Travelan











Product Centre











 


What is Travelan?              
Travelan is a natural product, specifically designed to reduce the risk of infection by Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella, Salmonella and other bacteria that cause Travellers’ Diarrhoea. 
 
What is Travellers’ Diarhoea?
Up to 70% of people who travel suffer from Travellers’ Diarrhoea, according to the Centre for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
Travellers’ Diarrhoea is characterised by fever, belly cramps and profuse watery diarrhoea that can last for several days and lead to severe dehydration.
Travellers’ Diarrhoea develops as a result of ingesting contaminated food and/or water and is common amongst travellers when visiting countries where they have no naturally developed immunity.
Infection with Enterotoxigenic E. coli is the most common cause of Travellers’ Diarrhoea.
 Travellers’ Diarrhoea can really ruin the enjoyment of your holiday or the effectiveness of a business trip. The devastating loss of your valuable time, money and memories can be disastrous.
 
How does Travelan work?
Travelan’s active ingredient is Hyperimmune Bovine Colostrum Powder, a rich source of antibodies that bind to Enterotoxigenic E. coli  in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from attaching to the intestinal wall and thereby neutralising their ability to cause Travellers’ Diarrhoea and its associated symptoms. Hyperrimune Colostrum is developed under Immruons' Proprietry Technology to create high titers of antibodies to a range of E- Coli bacteria that is present in normal colostrum in very small amounts.
 
When do I take Travelan?
Travelan is designed to be taken before every meal. Take one Travelan caplet before every meal.  Additional caplets may be taken when increased protection is required, i.e. when snacking between meals or if circumstances suggest an increased risk of infection.
Travelan should be used as an adjunct to normal travel hygiene practices such as “Boil it, cook it, peel it.”
 
Has Travelan been clinically tested?
Yes. Travelan has undergone clinical testing in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.
Clinical trials show Travelan confers protection of up to 90% against infection with the major strain of E.coli that causes Travellers’ Diarrhoea. In addition these trials showed a significant reduction in abdominal cramps and stomach pain compared to those who did not receive Travelan.  There were no reported treatment-related side effects.

About Immuron 
Immuron Ltd is a publicly listed Australian biopharmaceutical company focused on oral immunotherapy products for humans.  Immuron has a unique and versatile technology platform that is capable of generating a wide range of products, all with a high safety profile. 
The versatility of Immuron’s platform technology enables the development of medicines that target a large range of medical needs, including infectious diseases, immune mediated disorders and cancers. The versatility is also a function of the dairy origin of Immuron’s antibodies, which enables Immuron to commercialize its platform derived products through a range of regulatory pathways, including prescription (Rx), medical foods, over-the-counter medicines and also dietary supplements.
This high safety profile and all-natural composition of Immuron’s platform derived products confers on Immuron a significant competitive advantage and also allows Immuron to accelerate its product development. For example, Immuron received clearance from the FDA to commence a Phase IIb clinical trial for its NASH product, a potential block buster, in less than 3 years from commencing its NASH research and development program.
Immuron has one marketed product and a pipeline of products at various stages of clinical and earlier development. Immuron’s marketed product, Travelan, is for the prevention of travellers’ diarrhoea. It is licensed in Australia, in Canada, South African and Latin America, as well as a number of countries in South East Asia.
 
Company Background
Immuron has developed a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant production system that produces hyper-immune bovine colostrum powder (BCP) suitable for use as pharmaceuticals. This production system is the result of a significant body of know-how that Immuron developed over the years and is reflected in its standard operating protocols as well as aspects of the production system that are patented. The production system is capable of producing and has in fact already generated many tonnes of hyper-immune bovine colostrum powder. These large amounts of BCP can be generated within approximately 4 months.
 Since the Company’s inception, a considerable amount of work has led both to a greater understanding of the science underpinning the products and to optimization of the technology platform. 
In 2009 the Company entered into a collaboration with the Hadassah Medical Center Israel, through Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Limited, Hadassah’s commercialisation company. Through Hadassah’s broad ranging expertise Immuron is now also focused a range of chronic diseases such as liver disease, diabetes and other large target markets.
 Through its partnership with Hadassah, Immuron also significantly bolstered its research and development capabilities. The Company has direct access to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliant clinical trials unit at Hadassah Medical Center as well as its animal model laboratories. The team at Hadassah has already established clinical proof of concept for Immuron product candidate that targets Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).
