Libre’s Law – a new lease on life for pets and animals – signed


(Jun 29, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



In a rare outdoor ceremony, Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday, June 28, signed and enacted Libre’s Law – the comprehensive overhaul of Pennsylvania’s animal protection laws. It’s a huge step forward. I was proud to support the effort and shepherd the bill through my committee, which culminated with Act 10 of 2017 – better known as Libre’s Law after the cute Boston terrier pup left for dead last summer but nursed back to health. As you can see, he is now a healthy and relaxed dog! I believe that how you treat animals is a strong indicator of how you treat other people. Appropriately, Libre joined the governor by adding his paw print to the new law, which takes effect in 60 days. The new law is literally a new lease on life for the animals that depend on us for care, comfort and compassion. Soon, it will be a felony to torture a pet, and anyone who severely abuses a horse or tethers a dog outside in extreme weather will face serious criminal charges. Those convicted of abusing or neglecting animals face forfeiture of their pets and animals. Another provision will offer limited civil immunity for veterinarians and humane society police officers who report suspected animal cruelty.  Read more


 













Petrarca seeks boost in clubs’ share from small games of chance 


(Jun 13, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



HARRISBURG, June 13 – The threshold under which clubs can retain 100 percent of money raised through small games of chance would rise from $20,000 to $30,000 under an amendment from state Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D- Westmoreland/Armstrong/Indiana, that passed the House yesterday.   In addition to raising that cap by an additional $10,000, Petrarca’s amendment to H.B. 864 would hike the trigger for mandating a 60-40 split of all small games of chance proceeds from $40,000 to $60,000.   Essentially, Petrarca’s legislation is designed as a way for small clubs to keep more of the money they make under the Small Games of Chance Act, by raising the amount they can keep initially as well as the ceiling that mandates the start of the 60-40 split required by current law.   “Just as other things are indexed to account for inflation or are periodically updated to take into account rising costs, I am proposing that we update this several-years-old law in a practical and beneficial way,” Petrarca said. “Several small clubs, fraternal organizations and veterans groups in my district have approached me asking for a solution to what they see as a problem, which my bill will seek to address by updating the numbers that exist in current law.”  Read more


 













Rep. Petrarca introduces bill to increase organ donation in Pennsylvania 


(May 25, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



HARRISBURG, May 25 – State Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D-Westmoreland/Armstrong, has introduced legislation that would re-establish Pennsylvania as a leader in organ and tissue donation awareness and transplantation.   Commonly referred to as the Donate Life PA Act , this legislation would create a comprehensive framework for public education on organ and tissue donations, clarify the methods for making such donations, streamline the process of working with law enforcement in deaths under investigation and update the law to reflect the best clinical practices to support donations for transplantation.   “Every 18 hours, someone in Pennsylvania dies waiting for an organ that never comes. That's why this measure is so important. We will be able to help more than 8,000 patients awaiting life-saving organ transplants in the Commonwealth," Petrarca said.   Pennsylvania's current law was crafted in 1994 by Petrarca's father, the late Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca Sr., himself an organ donation recipient. Furthermore, that legislation helped set a national standard for anatomical donations.   Since its enactment, Pennsylvania hasn’t updated its organ and tissue donation laws, but nearly every other state has updated theirs.   “We’re working to reinforce the priority of transplantation in the law and to encourage the cooperation of medical examiners and coroners with organ procurement organizations. This will help us facilitate donations by avoiding  Read more


 













State Police promoting seat belt safety


(May 17, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



The Pennsylvania State Police is partnering with municipal police departments statewide during the national "Click it or Ticket" seat-belt enforcement mobilization through June 4. State and local police will provide increased seat-belt enforcement at state borders. According to state Transportation Department data, unrestrained fatalities decreased from 413 to 408 in 2016. The statewide number of crashes in which people were not wearing seat belts increased to 14,992, compared to 13,534 in 2015. State law requires drivers and passengers younger than 18 to wear a seat belt while riding in a vehicle. Pennsylvania's primary seat-belt law means that police can stop the vehicle to check seat-belt usage. Additionally, children younger than 2 must be secured in a rear-facing car seat, while children 2-4 must be in a child-safety seat and those between 4 and 8 must use a booster seat.

Petrarca: Washington Township receives $16,000 traffic signal grant


(May 12, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



VANDERGRIFT, May 12 - The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has announced a number of grants to maintain and upgrade traffic signals along state and local highways.   State Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D-Westmoreland/Armstrong/Indiana, reports that Washington Township will receive a state grant of $16,000 to help pay for maintenance of traffic signals. As part of the grant program, 20 percent of the project cost, or $4,000 will be the responsibility of the township.   The Green Light-Go Municipal Signal Partnership Program was established under Act 89 of 2013. The grants may be used for traffic studies, removal of unneeded traffic signals, replacement of signals with LED lights and retiming signals to improve traffic flow and safety.   "This grant will help the township ensure that the traffic signals work as needed," Petrarca said. "Maintenance now will hopefully prevent bigger expense down the road through system failure."   The grant money will be used for updating the lights, pavement markings and equipment for the signals at the intersections of Pa. Rt. 66 and Beaver Run Road/North Washington Road, Pa. Rts. 380 and 780 and the blinking amber lights at the intersection of Pa. Rts. 66 and 356 and also Pa. Rts. 66 and 366.   The grant announced was one of more than 90 being presented statewide, worth a total of $33 million.   ###  Read more


 













Petrarca amendment to end marriage license waiting period adopted by committee


(May 09, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



HARRISBURG, May 9 – State Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D-Westmoreland/Armstrong/Indiana, announced that the House Judiciary Committee approved his amendment to H.B.1008 , which would eliminate the mandatory three-day waiting period between when a couple applies for a marriage license and when it can be issued. The committee then voted to send the bill as amended to the full House. The bill would authorize former mayors that leave office for a higher office to maintain their authority to officiate marriages. Petrarca’s amendment adds the elimination of the marriage license waiting period to the scope of the bill. “The waiting period was established when most states, including Pennsylvania, required blood tests before issuing a marriage license,’” Petrarca said. “Pennsylvania dropped the blood test requirement 20 years ago, yet this delay still remains on the books. “In today’s society, with instantaneous processing via computers and without the blood testing requirement, there is no need to delay the process. “My amendment, now part of the bill, would allow the applicants to receive the marriage license upon application or via mail with no delay.” Pennsylvania is one of only 14 states that still require a mandatory waiting period of at least 24 hours between application and receipt of a wedding license. Three states, as well as the District of Columbia, also still require blood tests as part of the license  Read more

Petrarca announces $2.05 million grant to Unity Township for major storm sewer upgrade


(Apr 19, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



HARRISBURG, April 19 – Periodic flooding, sinkholes and erosion in Unity Township will be remedied by a $2.05 million state grant, state Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D- Westmoreland/Armstrong/Indiana, announced today.   Petrarca said the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority funding will enable installation of 6,800 feet of new storm sewer pipe, along with related inlets, end-walls, rip-rap and trench paving.   “The township’s existing storm sewer system is deteriorated to the extent that it has collapsed in some areas and flooding occurs every one to two years,” Petrarca said. “Because of related erosion, sediment is being deposited into nearby streams, adversely affecting water quality.   “This project represents a major upgrade to the Unity Township system, benefits the public health and creates 10 related construction jobs.”   Petrarca said he was happy to work to get this funding and added that the project will benefit a service area of 8,470 people.

Petrarca announces food service equipment grants for Kiski, Latrobe schools to provide healthier meals


(Apr 11, 2017) Rep. Joseph A. Petrarca



HARRISBURG, April 11 – Students at two schools in the 55 th Legislative District will be eating healthier thanks to food service equipment grants announced today by state Rep. Joseph Petrarca, D-Westmoreland/Armstrong/Indiana.   Petrarca said Latrobe Elementary School is receiving $15,213 for the purchase and installation of a combination oven, while Kiski Area East Primary School will get a $7,875.00 grant award for purchase and installation of a hot food serving counter.   “Combined, this is more than $23,000 coming into two of our area’s schools to help provide healthier food for our children,” Petrarca said. “These grants will help make sure that they are getting good, nutritious and safer meals.”   The grants come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, and are distributed through the state Department of Education using a competitive selection process. Priority is given to high-need schools where 50 percent or more of students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals.   Petrarca said 44 Pennsylvania schools received a total $844,776 in 2016 funding under the program, which seeks to improve food safety, expand student access to food and help purchase equipment to prepare better offerings that meet updated meal patterns.   Criteria also taken into account includes schools in underserved areas and the age of existing food service equipment, he said.  Read more
