Explanation of Responses:
1. These shares of the Issuer's common stock (the "Common Stock") were issued to the reporting person in exchange for shares of common stock of Advanced Disposal Waste Holdings Corp. ("Parent") that were cancelled and converted into shares of Common Stock of equivalent value in connection with the merger of Parent into the Issuer with the Issuer as the surviving corporation (the "Merger").  The Merger was exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to Rule 16b-7 thereunder.
2. Shares of Common Stock subject to a grant of restricted stock units made in connection with the Issuer's initial public offering.  The award will vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant (the date of grant being 10/12/2016).
3. Shares of Common Stock subject to a grant of restricted stock units made to replace restrict stock units of equivalent value that covered common stock of Parent and were cancelled in connection with the Merger. The award will vest in three equal installments over each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (date of grant being 6/24/2016).
4. Option awards that were granted to replace options of equivalent intrinsic value that covered common stock of Parent and were cancelled in connection with the Merger.
5. Prior to the closing of the Issuer's initial public offering, these options were scheduled to vest in full on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. However, by the terms of the award, upon the closing of the Issuer's initial public offering, the vesting schedule for these options changed so that 20% of the options were vested on the date of grant (03/04/2015) and 20% vested and will vest annually thereafter on the anniversary of the date of grant.
6. These options vest 20% on the date of grant (03/04/2015) and 20% annually thereafter on the anniversary of the date of grant.
7. Prior to the closing of the Issuer's initial public offering, these options were scheduled to vest in full on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.  However, by the terms of the award, upon the closing of the Issuer's initial public offering, the vesting schedule for these options changed so that 20% of the options were vested on the date of grant (05/14/2024) and 20% vested and will vest annually thereafter on the anniversary of the date of grant.
8. These options will vest in three equal installments over each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (date of grant being 6/24/2016).
9. Award of options made in connection with the Issuer's initial public offering, will vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant (the date of grant being 10/12/2016).
