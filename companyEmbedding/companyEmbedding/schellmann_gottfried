 ‚reality'
The data out of millions of collision events per second is filtered through two major trigger systems to store only 100s of events for
further analysis. Consequently the results of CERN’s experiments depend on computerized algorithms, which value the relevance of the collision events and automatically lead into an isolation from
maybe important information. Who knows about the significance of events, which were not in the self-created focus of analytic interest? How do filters affect our perception in general? How do you
perceive your illusive reality bubble?

I warmly invite you to visit my installation ‚reality’ at the exhibition circuit training - a forey into the world of the large hadron
collider of my art&science masterclass and the class of site-specific art in cooperation with CERN.
