KeyBank Faces Lawsuit over Hacking Banking
Jun 6 17
An Indiana man says in a federal lawsuit that KeyBank is responsible for the loss of $200,000 to a hacker because of the bank’s has lax security measures. The lawsuit filed in a federal court in Indiana, says a hacker gained control of Peter Jensen’s email and phone accounts in August 2015. Using the email account, the hacker sent a message to a Key-Bank employee requesting a $208,000 wire transfer to a bank account the hacker controlled, the suit states. A KeyBank employee tried to reach Jensen by phone to confirm the request, but the hacker picked up and authorized the transfer. The lawsuit says the Key-Bank employee who called to confirm the transfer only called to confirm the amount of money requested. The bank did not have in place any security measures, such as a fob or a “two-factor authentication,” that would include not only a username and password but another piece of information only the account holder would know, according to the suit. The stolen money was used to buy cars intended to be sold internationally, according to a news release from CipherLaw, which is representing Jensen. To date, the hacker has not been arrested, the suit says and Jensen has not gotten back any of his stolen money. Jensen is seeking the money he lost and an unnamed amount in damages. He accuses KeyBank of negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.
