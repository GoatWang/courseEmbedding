How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Graña Y Montero Announced That Backlog Is Close To US$ 3,600 Million






Business Wire




Mar 31, 2017 8:15 PM EDT













 


















































  Graña y Montero S.A.A. (NYSE:GRAM) (BVL:GRAMONC1) ("the Company" or "Graña y Montero") a leading Engineering and Construction company, announced today that in the General Shareholder Meeting, the appointment of 7 new members of the Board of Directors was approved, and now is comprised by a total of 9 members. In the afternoon, the new Board will hold its first session, in which it will appoint the Chairman and Vice-Chairman as well as distribute the responsibilities of the directors in the different operational committees of the Group.  During the meeting led by Luis Diaz Olivero, Chief Executive Officer of the Group, the portfolio of projects (backlog) was presented in detail. Up to February 2017, the projects amount to approximately US$ 3.6 billion, which demonstrates the Group's financial strength. He also indicated that 11% of this portfolio belongs to projects contracted with the public sector and the rest are private. Among the main projects are the expansion of Toquepala, the construction of Linea Amarilla, the construction and operation of the Shahuindo mine, the development and construction of La Arena Project, the construction of the Aloft Hotel, among others.  Diaz Olivero commented that, with respect to the indebtedness generated by the cancellation of the Peruvian Southern Gas Pipeline (GSP) contract, an agreement was reached with CHUBB Perú (Insurance and Reinsurance Company) to establish a 12-month payment term, which will have positive effect. He also added that, with respect to credit lines with the main banks with which the Group is related, they are close to reaching an agreement of a committed syndicated line that will ensure the working capital and the necessary guarantees to be able to execute its portfolio of projects, as well as being able to continue contracting in the future.  In addition to the review of the soundness of the Group's business, the shareholders learned about the initiatives taken to strengthen the corporate governance and compliance systems of Graña y Montero. The internal investigation commissioned in January to a prestigious international firm was mentioned, indicating that it will serve as a basis for decisions the company will take regarding legal actions.

History


                                After 84 years, Graña y Montero continues to grow with the same enthusiasm and vision for the future shared by three young engineers in 1933. 
                            

                                Markedly stronger and more diversified, with large-scale projects here and abroad, with a larger human team, with a common goal: operate under the principles and values that characterize the Graña y Montero Style. 
                            

Know our history


The Graña y Montero style


                                The history begins in 1933 when the founders decided to join together in order to "combine knowledge to perform any work", visionary statement that collects the origin of the Graña y Montero’s style.
                            

                                Values such as Quality, Compliance, Reliability and Efficiency as well as the strategies outlined by the organization do not arise from chance or a short-term perspective, they arise from the principles or foundations of a great collective work called Graña y Montero.
                            

Know our style


Our Model


                                Within our sustainability vision, we make of every one of our activities an opportunity for a positive change in society, by sharing the knowledge and attitudes which support good citizen behavior.
                            

                                We are aware that the infrastructure and services we provide cannot generate development by themselves. We need persons and institutions with the abilities and attitudes required to use this infrastructure properly... For such purpose, we have designed the Civic Development Model.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

About us

Introduction
The Graña y Montero Style
History

Vision: To be recognized as the most reliable engineering and infrastructure service group in Latin America.



About us Graña y Montero is a group of 26 engineering and infrastructure service companies operating in 5 countries in Latin America, permanent operations in Peru, Chile and Colombia and more than 23,200  collaborators.
Our mission is to meet the Engineering Services and Infrastructure requirements of clients beyond contractual obligations. 
Our vision is to be recognized as the most reliable engineering and infrastructure service group in Latin America.Graña y Montero Work Style: How and why we do things? Since our beginning, in 1933 when our founders decided to join together in order to "combine knowledge to perform any work", Graña y Montero Work style was there.      Values such as Quality, Compliance, Reliability and Efficiency as well as the strategies outlined by the organization do not arise from chance or a short-term perspective, they arise from the principles or foundations of a great collective work called Graña y Montero. In a style that allows us to get closer to our purpose of being "the most reliable Infrastructure and Engineering Services Group in Latin America".      The following has always been present in the Graña y Montero´s history: passion for learning, respect and commitment to people and their knowledge, responsible autonomy as well as a great ability to anticipate the challenges of the future and respond to the expectations of our clients, employees and other stakeholders.      Graña y Montero is a history consistent with its values and commitment with society. The continuous effort to be useful to society has always been present by transcending from ethics and example, doing things with a close and horizontal leadership, creating confident relations and generating wellbeing to the society from our businesses.      The Graña y Montero Work Style shows how we do things but also why we do these things. We believe that our work style is what differentiates us from other companies and what have been the basis for reaching 84 years successfully.     History After turning 84 years old, continues to grow with the same enthusiasm and vision for the future shared by three young engineers in 1933.      Markedly stronger and more diversified, with large-scale projects here and abroad, with a larger human team, with a common goal: to operate under the principles and values that characterize the Graña y Montero Style. 1933 – 1949 Gramonvel, The Adventure of the First Years On June 22, 1933, three young Peruvian engineers, Alejandro Graña Garland, Carlos Montero Bernales and Carlos Graña Elizalde, with the enthusiasm of youth, agreed to form a Technical Partnership in order to pool their knowledge together. In the beginning, the company was named GRAMONVEL, since the architect Hector Velarde Bergmann also participated as designer during the first few years.  Carlos Graña Elizalde was the first president of the company. He gave the company a long-term corporate vision, which has deservedly earned him recognition as one of the creators of the construction industry in Peru.  The company continued to expand its offerings through construction of larger-scale projects, such as railways and highways, previously built only by foreign companies. In 1942, it crossed the Peruvian border with its first project abroad: the Nestlé factory in Venezuela.  Between 1945 and 1957, the new town of Talara was built for the International Petroleum Company, destined for 20,000 residents. This was one of the biggest challenges for GRAMONVEL, since it encompassed schools, churches, a movie theater, an airport and more than 2,000 homes for an oil town. Major works: 1938 – Miraflores Seaside Bathhouse 1940 – Municipality of Miraflores – Maternity of Liima 1941 – Eternit Plant 1942 – El Pato Air Base – Nestlé Factory (Venezuela) 1943 – Casino de Ancón 1944 – Restoration of the Old Plaza de Acho Bullring – Las Palms Air Base – 4 Hangars 1948 – Delgado Trelles Hospital 1945 - 1957 – Town of Talara 1949 – 1968 Graña y Montero S.A. is born To guarantee its ability to meet the deadlines for these projects, GRAMONVEL S.A. and MORRIS y MONTERO S.A. merged with INVERSIONES INDUSTRIALES S.A. on October 31, 1949, creating GRAÑA Y MONTERO S.A. The union of both companies made it possible to establish a strong company to carry out the development projects needed by the country.  At this time, the company welcomed engineer Jorge Montero Muelle, who contributed his equipment and construction management know-how; the first president of Capeco, engineer Luis Graña Garland, a master construction engineer; and the estimator engineer Teodoro E. Harmsen, whose technical knowledge drove the development of the Technical Section of the company.  In 1952, for construction of the former Hospital del Empleado (now Rebagliati), our firm partnered with two other Peruvian companies: Florez y Costa S.A. and Andes Constructora S.A., to form the “Consorcio de Ingenieros Contratistas Generales” in February 1952. The most evident demonstration of this newly gained strength was the construction of 430 km of the Lima – Ica - Arequipa stretch of the South Pan-American Highway, started in 1953. They also built the Cañón del Pato Hydroelectric Plant, the Chimbote Iron and Steel Plant, the Monterrico Racetrack, the Lima Jorge Chávez Airport in Callao, the Paseo de la República avenue in Lima, known as the South Expressway, the El Alto Airport in La Paz, Bolivia, and the Nihuil Dam in Mendoza, Argentina. Major Projects: 1950 – Oechsle Department Store 1952 – Northern Perú Mining Corporation Concentrating Plant 1953 – Stretch of the South Pan-American Highway 1954 – Ministry of Economy and Finance – Rebagliatti Hospital 1955 – Sears Roebuck Department Store 1957 – Cañón del Pato Hydroelectric Plant – Ministry of Labor – Chimbote Iron and Steel Plant – Monterrico Racetrack 1958 – First National City Bank 1960 – Jorge Chávez International Airport 1962 – El Alto International Airport (Bolivia) 1967 – Paseo de la República 1968 – 1983 The Challenge for the Second Generation In 1968, the architect José Graña Miró Quesada and the engineer Carlos Montero Graña joined the company, which was going through a severe crisis due to the expropriations by the military government of companies that were our best clients. At this juncture, José Graña remembers:  “I learnt my first business lesson and had to make my first decision. I had discovered that companies are not inherited, but worked, and I had accepted the challenge of the second generation.  That is how what we could call the transitional or generational overlap stage began. Because I was not alone. We were five partners or families of partners and more than one hundred employees and engineers. This process of working concurrently, which in our case lasted ten years, is probably the most interesting and delicate period. I believe that in this period, the key word was: Respect. Respect for people, respect for partners, respect for traditions, respect for history, respect for the company’s values”.  José Graña Miró Quesada  In 1969, the development of a small brochure indicating the main projects carried out by Graña y Montero strengthened the recognition of the work done by the first generation to keep the company values alive. In turn, this attitude helped the present generation to naturally start delegating functions to the following generation.  In 1977, Graña y Montero S.A. inaugurated its new offices in its own three-story building, located on the 46th block of Paseo de la República, in the district of Surquillo (Block 1 of the present building).  José Graña Miró Quesada became the General Manager of Graña y Montero S.A. in 1982. Major Projects: 1968 – Círculo Militar del Perú – Gálax Supermarket 1970 – Cementos Lima Plant 1974 – Pepesca Fishery – Hotel Sheraton de Lima 1976 – Mina Cuajone Mine 1977 – Civic Center Tower 1980 – Banco Central de Reserva – Banco Continental and Shopping Center 1981 – Iquitos Steam Thermal Plant 1982 – Ilo-Desaguadero Highway 1983 – 1990 The Graña y Montero Holding With the 50-year anniversary of the company’s founding, a diversification process began that would change the company. Growing and diversifying became the new corporate challenge, giving rise to the establishment of Corporación Graña y Montero S.A.A. as a holding company for the group of companies under its management and control.  In August 1984, the first company leading to the future holding company was founded: GMI, Graña y Montero Ingeniería, a consulting firm to manage engineering services separately.  Next came GMP, Graña y Montero Petrolera, on November 5, to engage in petroleum and gas operation infrastructure. On June 30, 1985, GMD, Graña y Montero Digital, was founded for IT engineering services as a result of the partnership with the Chilean company Sonda and with the representation of Digital. Likewise, GMB was created with Blocker, a US company, to provide services to the oil industry. On January 30, 1987, GME, Graña y Montero Edificaciones, was founded in partnership with Mario Alvarado B., to engage in real estate development and investment. On May 24, 1990, in partnership with Alshthom, GMA was founded to engage in electromechanical assembly and, lastly, on October 9, 1990, GyM, Graña y Montero Contratistas, the company’s former construction company, was established. Major Projects: 1983 – Oxy / Block 1AB Andoas Plus 1984 – Pucallpa Thermal Power Pant – Machu Picchu Hydroelectric Plant 1986 – Hospital Regional del Cuzco – Instituto Peruano de Seguridad Social 1987 – Palma del Espino Plant and Houses 1988 – Nuevo Centro Poblado “Cruce de Cajamarca” 1990 – Tinajones Special Project – Chavimochic Irrigation Project 1990 – 1997 New Policies, New Processes, New Markets The 1990’s began with our introduction to the Mexican market with the construction of the Four Seasons Hotel in Mexico City and the Plaza and Pasaje Santa Fe projects in that city. New projects here and abroad continue to be ongoing.  On October 16, 1990, the first issue of the “Somos GM” corporate bulletin was published to communicate major institutional events and news. In 1994, Graña y Montero S.A. was recognized as a national leader in organizational change, by developing various policies, including “Before Deadline”, the “Ethics Charter”, “Service Quality” and, later on, the “Client-Partner” policy, to ensure compliance with the three company values: Compliance, Seriousness and Quality.  The company successfully participated in the Peruvian privatization process, becoming the Peruvian partner of Telefónica, Edegel and Repsol. The Graña y Montero S.A. Holding was created by the end of 1996 to ensure the organization’s healthy growth and to leverage the existing synergy to work on increasingly complex projects. Major Projects: 1991 – Operation of Oil Blocks I (1991) and V (1993) 1993 – Ventanilla Thermal Power Plant 1994 – Hotel Four Seasons (México) 1995 – Hotel Oro Verde (Swissotel) – Sulfuric Acid Plant N° 1 of Ilo-Southern Corporation – United States Embassy – Maintenance of the North Peruvian Pipeline 1996 – Microstations of the Chavimochic Project 1997 – 2003 Graña y Montero in the Lima Stock Exchange The following year, Corporación Graña y Montero received two recognitions: firstly, the Puente de Alcántara National Award for completion of the Chavimochic Hydroelectric Power Project, and secondly, the Business Creativity Award for the Larcomar Project started in July 1997, under our “Before the Deadline” policy. In addition, on August 26, the company became a public corporation trading its stock in the Lima Stock Exchange.  In 1999, the Centro Corporativo de Aprendizaje (CCA) was created as a corporate-level knowledge management center, driving maximum leveraging of the information resulting from our experience gathered in the course of our history and as a focal point from which to transmit knowledge and learning of our professionals. Major Projects: 1997 – Expansion of the Cementos Lima Plant 1998 – Brocal Project – Larcomar – Chinecas Project – Deepening of El Porvenir Mine – Expansion of the Cuajone Mine – Rehabilitation of the Ilo – Desaguadero Highway – Gold Concentrator Plant for Minera Ares 1999 – Antamina Project – Pierina Mining Project for Minera Barrick – Expansion of the Viacha Cement Plant (Bolivia) – Yanango Hydroelectric Plant – Cañón de Pato Hydroelectric Plant 2000 – Lima Marriot Hotel – Messer Oxygen Plant – Ripley San Isidro – 605 km Mantaro – Socabaya 605 km Tranmsission Line – Torata Tunnel 2002 – Camisea C1 – USAID Building 2003 – 2009 New Infrastructure Business: Concessions New Infrastructure Business  In accordance with the Specialization Strategic Objective, in 2004, 70% of the company’s business was in the energy and mining industry. In addition, as a result of the Group’s Diversification Strategy, 40% of gross profits were obtained from non-construction related activities.  In the past few years, this strategy has been enhanced by the decision to actively participate in stable capital flow businesses, such as infrastructure, seeking further bottom line stability for the Group. Major Projects: 2003 – Camisea Gas Distribution Grid in Lima – Pisco-Camisea Fractioning Plant – Concession Red Vial 5: Ancón - Huacho – Pativilca Highway 2004 – Yanacocha Leach Pad Stage 5 and 6 – Ralco Hydroelectric Plant (Chile) 2005 – Cerro Verde Mine Concentrating Plant for Phelps Dodge 2006 – Minera San Cristóbal Concentrating Plant (Bolivia) 2007 – Concession of the Ovalo Gutiérrez Parking Lot – IIRSA Sur Section 1: San Juan de Marcona - Urcos – Management of the Hotel Paradisus Punta Cana ‘The Reserve’ Project (Dominican Republic) 2008 – Cerro Corona Mine Concentrating Plant for GoldFields – Expansion of the Malvinas Gas Separation Plant – Concession of the Fuel Storage and Distribution System of Bolivia, as part of Consorcio Terminales. 2009 - To the Present... In recent years, thanks to its experience as the first road concession holder company in Peru, the Group has increased its role in this business significantly, currently being in charge of operating more than  3,400 km of roads through its  subsidiary CONCAR S.A.  During 2011, five companies were incorporated to the Group: GSD, specializing in Document Digitizing; CAM, specializing in services for the electric power industry; Stracon GyM for mining services; La Chira S.A. for the La Chira Wastewater Treatment Plant Concession; and Ferrovías GyM for train operation, beginning with operation of Line One of the Lima Metro.  The company STRACON GyM, resulting from the consolation of Services Miners de GyM S.A. and STRACON. From New Zealand, started operating in March 2012.  In November of the same year, in line with our corporate strategy of regional growth, we acquired 74% of the equity of the Chilean company Vial y Vives S. A., specializing in construction for the mining sector. The following year, in August, the Chilean company DSD Construcciones y Montajes S. A., specializing in comprehensive solutions for industrial pants in the mining, refinery, petrochemical., cellulose, energy and other sectors, joined the Graña y Montero Group. The union of both companies on July 1, 2014, originated Vial y Vives-DSD.  The year 2013 was very special for the Group. It became the first Peruvian construction company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after successfully completing a public offering of shares for approximately  413 million dollars. In 2014, the Graña y Montero Gropu purchased the majority shareholdings of two companies leaders in their respective sectors: the Colombian Morelco S.A., specializing in civil works, electromechanical assembly and services for the oil, gas and emery industry; and Compañía Operadora de Gas del Amazonas (COGA), Peruvian company dedicated to the operation and maintenance of natural gas and natural gas liquids transport systems. Furthermore, in 2015, Adexus, a firm engaged in the provision of outsourcing and information technology services in Chile joined the Group. With Adexus, we have strengthened the Services business area of the Group and our presence as a regional player in the technology sector.  At present, Graña y Montero is the only Peruvian firm in its business line present in the Lima Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. It is the clear leader in the country’s engineering and infrastructure industry, and operates in 7 countries in Latin America.
