History[edit]
Patheon was founded in Canada in 1974 as Custom Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In 1990, it began to expand to US markets. Custom Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Patheon in 1993 and was first publicly traded that year on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[4]
In 2004, Patheon acquired MOVA, a drug manufacturer based in Puerto Rico, US. The deal proved unprofitable, and in 2007, the New York equity firm JLL Partners provided Patheon $150 million to restructure. Two years later, after a failed takeover bid by Lonza Group, JLL Partners bought a controlling interest in the company.[8]
In 2013, Patheon acquired Banner Pharmacaps, a drug manufacturer specializing in softgels, for $255 million. (Patheon changed the company's name the following year to "Banner Life Sciences").[9] In a $2.6 billion deal, Patheon merged with the pharmaceutical division of Royal DSM NV in 2014 after JLL Partners bought a controlling stake in the latter as well, adding significantly to Patheon's European production capacity.[10][11]
In 2015, Patheon acquired Agere Pharmaceuticals, an Oregon, US company specializing in drug solubility, and IRIX, a maker of specialist Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in South Carolina, US, the latter for $162.78 million.[12][13]
In May 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced it would acquire Patheon for $7.2 billion.[14]
Dosage Forms, Products[edit]
Patheon does not own any of the licences of the products it manufactures and is often listed as the manufacturer on packaging, with the product licence holder's brand name, product name and corporate identity being used. Patheon's clients include such pharmaceutical brands as Merck & Co, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis, with biotechnology customers including Amgen and Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Patheon has manufactured or developed more than 800 products.[15]
Development activities are undertaken by Patheon Pharmaceutical Development Services (known as PDS), a division of Patheon Inc. operating in Europe, Canada and the United States. As of 2016, Patheon owns manufacturing sites in Canada, the continental US, Puerto Rico, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.[7]
Patheon manufactures products in various dosage forms: oral (tablets, capsules), injectable sterile products (vials, ampoules, pre-filled syringes containing liquids, powders and lyophilisates) and topicals (creams, ointments, drops, nasal sprays, medicated and non-medicated gauze).

Patheon – A healthier world. Delivered.

	We believe the world would be a healthier place if tomorrow's medicines were made available today. Patheon is transforming the way pharmaceuticals are made with a simplified, end-to-end supply chain solution for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Drug substances and drug products. Development and manufacturing. Small and large molecules. Sterile, oral solid and softgel dosage forms. Patheon offers a comprehensive range of services spanning all phases and scales that is wider and deeper than that of any other contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO).


	Patheon gives even the smallest pharma and biotech companies instant access to a fully integrated global network of facilities across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. This includes eleven for commercial-scale finished dosage forms, four for API process development and manufacturing, four for biologics, and ten for pharmaceutical development.


	Our global leadership is built upon a reputation for scientific and technical excellence. This includes specialized capabilities for highly potent and controlled substances, aseptic filling and lyophilization, complex formulations, solubility enhancement and difficult to manufacture APIs. There is also Patheon OneSource™ a program that aligns development of drug substance and drug product in a coordinated drive toward proof of concept that can take months off of development timelines.


	Patheon has more than 9,000 scientific and professional staff and over 40 years of experience. As a leading global CDMO, we deliver unrivaled quality, reliability and compliance. Together with more than 400 clients, Patheon is rapidly turning pharmaceutical possibilities into reality.

Thermo Fisher to acquire Patheon in deal valued at $7.2 billion, including $2 billion net debt
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  said Monday it has agreed to acquire Patheon N.V.  for $35 a share, or $7.2 billion including $2 billion of net debt. Thermo Fisher, which offers services to help with research and laboratory productivity, said it expects the deal to be "immediately and significantly" accretive to adjusted per-share earnings, adding 30 cents in the first full year after close. Patheon offers complex development and manufacturing services (CDMO) to biopharmaceutical companies. The combination will give Thermo Fisher a foothold in the high-growth CDMO market, which it estimates is worth about $40 billion. Patheon has about 9,000 employees worldwide and generated 2016 revenue of about $1.9 billion. The deal is expected to close by year-end. Thermo Fisher has committed debt financing from Goldman Sachs and expects to finance the deal with about $5.2 billion of debt and $2 billion of equity. Patheon shares jumped 34% premarket on the news. Thermo Fisher was not yet active, but has gained 22% in 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 , which has gained about 7%.

Thermo Fisher to acquire Patheon in deal valued at $7.2 billion, including $2 billion net debt
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.  said Monday it has agreed to acquire Patheon N.V.  for $35 a share, or $7.2 billion including $2 billion of net debt. Thermo Fisher, which offers services to help with research and laboratory productivity, said it expects the deal to be "immediately and significantly" accretive to adjusted per-share earnings, adding 30 cents in the first full year after close. Patheon offers complex development and manufacturing services (CDMO) to biopharmaceutical companies. The combination will give Thermo Fisher a foothold in the high-growth CDMO market, which it estimates is worth about $40 billion. Patheon has about 9,000 employees worldwide and generated 2016 revenue of about $1.9 billion. The deal is expected to close by year-end. Thermo Fisher has committed debt financing from Goldman Sachs and expects to finance the deal with about $5.2 billion of debt and $2 billion of equity. Patheon shares jumped 34% premarket on the news. Thermo Fisher was not yet active, but has gained 22% in 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 , which has gained about 7%.

Patheon N.V. is a pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) headquartered in Amsterdam. It provides contract development and manufacturing services of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products for approximately 400 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.[3]
It was founded in 1974 as Custom Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and changed its name to Patheon in 1993 when it was first publicly traded.[4] The New York private equity firm JLL Partners has owned a controlling stake in Patheon since 2009.[5] In 2014, Patheon merged with the drug manufacturing business of Royal DSM NV, becoming a joint-venture between JLL Partners and DSM.[6] As of 2016, Patheon owns manufacturing sites in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia.,[7] and Canada.

History[edit]
Patheon was founded in Canada in 1974 as Custom Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In 1990, it began to expand to US markets. Custom Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Patheon in 1993 and was first publicly traded that year on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[4]
In 2004, Patheon acquired MOVA, a drug manufacturer based in Puerto Rico, US. The deal proved unprofitable, and in 2007, the New York equity firm JLL Partners provided Patheon $150 million to restructure. Two years later, after a failed takeover bid by Lonza Group, JLL Partners bought a controlling interest in the company.[8]
In 2013, Patheon acquired Banner Pharmacaps, a drug manufacturer specializing in softgels, for $255 million. (Patheon changed the company's name the following year to "Banner Life Sciences").[9] In a $2.6 billion deal, Patheon merged with the pharmaceutical division of Royal DSM NV in 2014 after JLL Partners bought a controlling stake in the latter as well, adding significantly to Patheon's European production capacity.[10][11]
In 2015, Patheon acquired Agere Pharmaceuticals, an Oregon, US company specializing in drug solubility, and IRIX, a maker of specialist Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in South Carolina, US, the latter for $162.78 million.[12][13]
In May 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced it would acquire Patheon for $7.2 billion.[14]
Dosage Forms, Products[edit]
Patheon does not own any of the licences of the products it manufactures and is often listed as the manufacturer on packaging, with the product licence holder's brand name, product name and corporate identity being used. Patheon's clients include such pharmaceutical brands as Merck & Co, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis, with biotechnology customers including Amgen and Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Patheon has manufactured or developed more than 800 products.[15]
Development activities are undertaken by Patheon Pharmaceutical Development Services (known as PDS), a division of Patheon Inc. operating in Europe, Canada and the United States. As of 2016, Patheon owns manufacturing sites in Canada, the continental US, Puerto Rico, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.[7]

History[edit]
Patheon was founded in Canada in 1974 as Custom Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In 1990, it began to expand to US markets. Custom Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Patheon in 1993 and was first publicly traded that year on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[4]
In 2004, Patheon acquired MOVA, a drug manufacturer based in Puerto Rico, US. The deal proved unprofitable, and in 2007, the New York equity firm JLL Partners provided Patheon $150 million to restructure. Two years later, after a failed takeover bid by Lonza Group, JLL Partners bought a controlling interest in the company.[8]
In 2013, Patheon acquired Banner Pharmacaps, a drug manufacturer specializing in softgels, for $255 million. (Patheon changed the company's name the following year to "Banner Life Sciences").[9] In a $2.6 billion deal, Patheon merged with the pharmaceutical division of Royal DSM NV in 2014 after JLL Partners bought a controlling stake in the latter as well, adding significantly to Patheon's European production capacity.[10][11]
In 2015, Patheon acquired Agere Pharmaceuticals, an Oregon, US company specializing in drug solubility, and IRIX, a maker of specialist Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in South Carolina, US, the latter for $162.78 million.[12][13]
In May 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced it would acquire Patheon for $7.2 billion.[14]
Dosage Forms, Products[edit]
Patheon does not own any of the licences of the products it manufactures and is often listed as the manufacturer on packaging, with the product licence holder's brand name, product name and corporate identity being used. Patheon's clients include such pharmaceutical brands as Merck & Co, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis, with biotechnology customers including Amgen and Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Patheon has manufactured or developed more than 800 products.[15]
Development activities are undertaken by Patheon Pharmaceutical Development Services (known as PDS), a division of Patheon Inc. operating in Europe, Canada and the United States. As of 2016, Patheon owns manufacturing sites in Canada, the continental US, Puerto Rico, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.[7]
Patheon manufactures products in various dosage forms: oral (tablets, capsules), injectable sterile products (vials, ampoules, pre-filled syringes containing liquids, powders and lyophilisates) and topicals (creams, ointments, drops, nasal sprays, medicated and non-medicated gauze).

History[edit]
Patheon was founded in Canada in 1974 as Custom Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In 1990, it began to expand to US markets. Custom Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Patheon in 1993 and was first publicly traded that year on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[4]
In 2004, Patheon acquired MOVA, a drug manufacturer based in Puerto Rico, US. The deal proved unprofitable, and in 2007, the New York equity firm JLL Partners provided Patheon $150 million to restructure. Two years later, after a failed takeover bid by Lonza Group, JLL Partners bought a controlling interest in the company.[8]
In 2013, Patheon acquired Banner Pharmacaps, a drug manufacturer specializing in softgels, for $255 million. (Patheon changed the company's name the following year to "Banner Life Sciences").[9] In a $2.6 billion deal, Patheon merged with the pharmaceutical division of Royal DSM NV in 2014 after JLL Partners bought a controlling stake in the latter as well, adding significantly to Patheon's European production capacity.[10][11]
In 2015, Patheon acquired Agere Pharmaceuticals, an Oregon, US company specializing in drug solubility, and IRIX, a maker of specialist Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in South Carolina, US, the latter for $162.78 million.[12][13]
In May 2017, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced it would acquire Patheon for $7.2 billion.[14]
Dosage Forms, Products[edit]
Patheon does not own any of the licences of the products it manufactures and is often listed as the manufacturer on packaging, with the product licence holder's brand name, product name and corporate identity being used. Patheon's clients include such pharmaceutical brands as Merck & Co, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis, with biotechnology customers including Amgen and Avanir Pharmaceuticals. Patheon has manufactured or developed more than 800 products.[15]
Development activities are undertaken by Patheon Pharmaceutical Development Services (known as PDS), a division of Patheon Inc. operating in Europe, Canada and the United States. As of 2016, Patheon owns manufacturing sites in Canada, the continental US, Puerto Rico, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.[7]
Patheon manufactures products in various dosage forms: oral (tablets, capsules), injectable sterile products (vials, ampoules, pre-filled syringes containing liquids, powders and lyophilisates) and topicals (creams, ointments, drops, nasal sprays, medicated and non-medicated gauze).
