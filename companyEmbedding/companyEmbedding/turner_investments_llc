Turner’s Four Phases of Growth Investing for the Future.

InnovatorPhase One: Companies that have built a market presence (with a product or service offering) in a new sub-industry category
AcceleratorPhase Two: A select group of companies that quickly advance ahead of the initial group of competitors
DisruptorPhase Three: Companies that offer new efficiencies and introduce a radical change in an existing market
Market LeaderPhase Four: Companies that have earned the largest market share in their industry and dominate within their competitive landscape







We are independent, passionate, and focused.

We believe that innovation drives earnings and earnings drive stock prices.  Our commitment to finding companies that will be the next great Innovator, Accelerator, Disruptor, or Market Leader, has never been stronger.

Portfolio Manager

				Scott Swickard, CFA


	*Formerly known as the Turner Spectrum Fund and and subsequently Turner Titan II Fund


	 


	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund invests in stocks of companies with primarily large capitalization ranges across all major industry sectors using a long/short strategy in seeking to capture alpha, reduce volatility, and preserve capital in declining markets.

 Investment Objectives
	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and is intended for investors seeking long-term growth of capital.

 Investment Process
	We understand the DNA of great growth companies:





	The heart of Turner’s stock selection process is fundamental analysis. For long positions, we seek to identify:


	Global companies benefiting from change:


Accelerating earnings
Improving expectations
High returns on capital


	Industry leaders:


Strong management
Sustainable earnings, margins, and revenue growth
Compelling new products and services
Open-ended business opportunities
Market share gains


	For short positions, we seek to identify companies that exhibit the following:


Decelerating earnings prospects and declining business momentum.
Overwhelming competitive or financial challenges with negative near-term catalysts.
Loss of market share due to poor execution or a lack of innovation.
Questionable accounting practices and deteriorating operating models.

 Risk Disclosure
The performance data quoted represents past performance and the principal value and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown here. Please call 800.224.6312 or visit our website www.turnerinvestments.com for performance current to the most recent month end. Returns shown, unless otherwise indicated, are total returns, with dividends and income reinvested. Returns spanning more than one year are annualized. Fee waivers are in effect; if they had not been in effect performance would have been lower.


Past performance can vary over short periods. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


	Since it purchases equity securities, including common stocks, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time.  These factors contribute to price volatility, which is the principal risk of investing in the Fund.  


	 


	The Fund may focus its investments from time to time on one or more economic sectors.  To the extent that it does so, developments affecting companies in that sector or sectors will likely have a magnified effect on the Fund’s net asset value and total return.


	 


	The Fund is subject to the risks associated with selling securities short. A short sale involves a finite opportunity for appreciation, but a theoretically unlimited risk of loss.


	 


	The smaller capitalization companies the Fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. Therefore, small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies.


	 


	The Fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments.  Foreign investments may be riskier than U.S. investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions, changes in currency exchange rates, incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities, and political or economic instability.  Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment.


	 


	The Fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options, including: (1) the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities, fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates; (2) there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of options and the securities underlying them; (3) there may not be a liquid secondary market for options; and (4) while the Fund will receive a premium when it writes call options, it may not participate fully in a rise in the market value of the underlying security.

Capital Gains


All mutual funds, regardless of performance, must distribute to shareholders any net realized gains from the sale of individual securities in their portfolios. Distributions are made to those who are registered shareholders of the fund on the record date. Distributions are paid on the pay date. All dates and distributions are subject to board approval. Distributions will vary depending on the funds' income and any profits realized from the sale of securities in the funds' portfolio. Past distributions are not indicative of future trends. A fund's per share capital gain distributions are the same for each share class offered.


Below is the list of Turner Funds and capital gains distributions, as of December 19, 2016. Capital gains are payable to the shareholders of record as of December 16, 2016 (the "Record Date") with the distribution occurring on December 20, 2016 (the "Payable Date"). These estimated distributions can change prior to the distribution date due to market activity and change in shares outstanding. The distributions do not include ordinary income distributions the fund may be making. In December, we plan to provide final estimates, including a breakdown between long and short-term gains and income, for all funds. Final distribution amounts will be added to each fund's profile page after the fund's declaration date in December. Shareholders are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their investments in the funds.


To estimate your distribution for a fund on this list, multiply the number of shares you own by the fund’s total per-share capital gains estimates.
