My turn: Jeffrey S. Geiger: Creating a stronger manufacturing workforce



Saturday
Jul 8, 2017 at 3:00 PM








On Saturday, at our Electric Boat manufacturing facility in Quonset Point, we celebrated the keel laying of the 20th Virginia-class submarine, the Oregon. This is a shipbuilding tradition held to formally recognize the beginning of the construction process. The ship’s sponsor, Mrs. Dana Richardson, declared the keel “well and truly laid” before state, federal and U.S. Navy officials.Also invited were the 3,700 Electric Boat employees who work at Quonset Point, building our nation’s nuclear-powered submarines. Submarine construction is a unique form of heavy manufacturing that is labor-intensive and high-technology-based. Our jobs provide good wages and benefits in a business essential to our national security.As with many manufacturers, our labor force is aging. With significant growth on the horizon, Electric Boat will need to hire 14,000 new employees (including 10,000 in skilled trades) over the next decade to build the submarines the Navy requires.In today’s environment, however, Electric Boat is challenged to hire the workers it needs. Our manufacturing work requires a high degree of skill. Many jobs require a security clearance. Our products are powered by nuclear reactors, operating in the harshest environment on the planet. So we are taking proactive steps to ensure we will have the workforce we require. The lessons learned at Electric Boat can provide a blueprint for other employers and for potential partners in all levels of government.People in our region want to work. Unfortunately not enough people have the necessary skills. Fortunately, we have found strong partners across Rhode Island. Through Gov. Gina Raimondo's Real Jobs Rhode Island program, we have created partnerships that match job-training programs with Electric Boat’s needs, resulting in wins for government, industry and the community. EB has strong, consistent pipelines of talent, and Rhode Island has more qualified people in the workforce.We have worked with our partners to better communicate the skills we require, and the curricula that can provide those skills. Our partners identify learning institutions that can deliver our curricula.While the public sector takes the lead to obtain grant funds, we provide matching funds, donations-in-kind and commitments to hiring trainees. Electric Boat mentors students and provides feedback on the performance of these new employees.We are collaborating with the Rhode Island Department of Education to bring a nationally recognized shipbuilding curriculum into six high schools, completion of which gives students a preference for job interviews at our company. The first class from one of these schools recently graduated, and all five graduates have jobs at Electric Boat.Next year’s classes already have 350 students enrolled, a significant increase over this year. We expect even more students to sign up as they recognize the opportunity to learn career skills without incurring college costs.Another public-private partnership has brought the Westerly Education Center to life. Investments from the Royce Family Foundation and Electric Boat, coupled with support and leadership from the state, has produced a school where people can learn or sharpen electrical, sheet-metal and pipe-fitting skills.So far, 147 EB Quonset Point employees have completed or are close to completing training in pipe-fitting and sheet metal work. A mock-up of a submarine’s hull at the facility enables trainees to practice their new skills in addition to receiving classroom instruction.As we also have a significant presence in Connecticut, we have worked with leaders there to develop similar programs. Recognizing the regional nature of our economy, leaders in Connecticut and Rhode Island are working together to ensure that residents can participate in either state’s training programs. This is a tremendous example of the way the public and private sectors can cooperate to put people to work.These powerful partnerships have demonstrated that it is critical that the public and private sectors work together. Governor Raimondo and her team have demonstrated the leadership required. Job training provides the skills that employers need. All participants invest, including industry.Electric Boat’s manufacturing business is growing, providing Americans with the kind of good, stable jobs that will help rebuild the middle class. As our business grows, so does our local economy. In May, unemployment in Rhode Island was at 4.1 percent, below the national average and far lower than Rhode Island’s rate of more 10.6 percent in May 2012.To recruit the workforce American manufacturers need, the public and private sectors must bring high schools, colleges and community organizations into the effort. Based on our experience at Electric Boat, we know such partnerships benefit everyone. Jeffrey S. Geiger is the president of General Dynamics Electric Boat.

Product Story
Catalyst is a furniture-based system that equips open-plan and private-office vistas with equal ease. Named for the role played by mission-critical teams in law firms, financial-services companies and other professional organizations, Catalyst creates constructive settings for those who provoke action and keep workflows moving. Catalyst anticipates a user's access needs—to colleagues, storage, other activity areas, daylight, technology—intuitively and unobtrusively.



Product Story
Catalyst offers storage and technology access specifically tailored to the professions, such as law firms and financial-services organizations. Lower storage accommodates Redweld folders, Pendaflex files and Bankers Boxes, as well as standard legal binders; overhead storage likewise provides for Redweld folders and standard binders.



Product Story
Power and data access is within easy reach on worksurfaces, via an integrated, UL-approved power module with connections for electric, USB power and voice/data. A deep, continuous wire chase in the back of storage units, as well as pass-throughs within cabinets, provide easy access to wall and floor outlets. LED task lights provide even, energy-efficient lighting, with cords concealed in the loop support structure.



Product Story
Catalyst is the first to offer a free­standing overhead shelf supported only by metal loops: the shelf provides a ledge for conducting casual interactions or a support for overhead storage. In space plans where individual private offices are less common, Catalyst maintains the personal comfort and high material standards of executive offices for those managers and executives now joining open-plan or collaborative settings. A new vocabulary of furniture for the professions, Catalyst furnishes workspaces that place a premium on the people who use them and the contributions they make to the enterprise.

Six Basic Elements Comprise Every Configuration
The same storage, work and privacy components comprise every Catalyst open
or private office configuration: base, storage, top, shelf, overhead, divider.

Drawer and Pullout Tray
Credenzas can be configured with open cubbies, file drawers
or full-height doors, behind which are shelves or a pullout 
tray for stowing laptops and other accessories.






Power System
Storage credenzas provide a 6" continuous wire chase, which houses power modules. Power, voice and data cables from the floor enter 2-1/2" access holes on the storage credenza's bottom panel.






Power Module
Power module is UL-approved for use throughout the United States and includes five outlets on four circuits (one dedicated), one powered USB port and one slot that accepts third-party faceplates for voice and data.
