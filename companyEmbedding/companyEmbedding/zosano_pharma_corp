					Full Description



Zosano Pharma Corporation, incorporated on January 26, 2012, is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company has developed a transdermal microneedle patch system to deliver its formulations of existing drugs through the skin for the treatment of a range of indications. Its microneedle patch system offers consistent drug delivery, and improved ease of use and room-temperature stability. Its microneedle patch system has the potential to deliver various medications for a range of indications in commercially attractive markets.The Company's short-wear-time transdermal patch consists of an array of titanium microneedles that is coated with its formulation of an approved drug and attached to an adhesive patch. When the patch is applied with its hand-held applicator, the microneedles painlessly penetrate the skin, resulting in rapid dissolution and absorption of the drug coating through the capillary bed. Its product candidates include ZP-Triptan, ZP-Glucagon and ZP-PTH.ZP-PTHZP-PTH is a formulation of teriparatide, a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone, which is referred as PTH 1-34, or PTH, which regulates serum calcium, to be administered for the treatment of severe osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease primarily affecting post-menopausal women that is characterized by low bone mineral and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which can lead to an increase in bone fractures. The Company has developed a daily and a weekly dose regimen of ZP-PTH, and completed a Phase II clinical trial on Daily ZP-PTH and a Phase I clinical trial on Weekly ZP-PTH.ZP-GlucagonZP-Glucagon is a formulation of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels, intended for the emergency rescue of patients suffering from life-threatening, severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes treatment, often caused by insulin overdose, characterized by a low level of blood glucose that can lead to loss of consciousness, seizure, coma and death. The Company completed a Phase I trial of ZP-Glucagon. It also completed a Phase II clinical trial in Australia to evaluate the performance of ZP-Glucagon product candidate in Type 1 diabetic patients at approximately 0.5 mg and one mg doses, with induction of hypoglycemia, in comparison to comparable doses of glucagon administered by intramuscular injection (IM).ZP-TriptanZP-Triptan is a formulation of zolmitriptan, one of a class of serotonin receptor agonists known as triptans used for the treatment of migraine. ZP-Triptan microneedle patch is applied to an individual's upper arm to deliver zolmitriptan to the body, with the objective of providing rapid onset relief from headache symptoms. The Company announced positive results from Phase I clinical trial of ZP-Triptan patch, which was conducted in healthy human subjects in Australia.

Zosano to Present Migraine Data at Three Industry-Leading ConferencesBack to ZSAN Snapshot

Share Story8:31AM ET 6/01/2017 Globe NewswireLate-Breaking Oral and Oral Presentations to feature M207 Acute Migraine Therapy
Zotrip Pivotal Trial Data Selected by Headache Society and Drug Delivery Meetings
FREMONT, Calif., June  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zosano Pharma Corporation (NASDAQ:ZSAN), a specialty pharmaceutical company that recently established a differentiated safety and efficacy profile in a pivotal trial with its lead product, M207, as an acute treatment for migraine, today announced that three conferences have accepted Zosano submissions for oral presentation at their annual meetings.  Zosano will have a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Headache Society meeting in June, as well as an oral presentation at the International Headache Society meeting in September.  In addition, Zosano has been selected to present at the Transdermal and Intradermal Drug Delivery Systems conference, also in September.
"The selection of our data for oral presentations at these key medical meetings underscores the need for new therapies for migraine patients," said Don Kellerman, Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs at Zosano. "We believe that it is important to increase awareness of M207 and its compelling clinical results among key opinion leaders as well as community physicians."  
"The clearly differentiating data from our Zotrip trial highlights the potential of our lead migraine product as well as the underlying technology that has made its clinical results possible," said John Walker, Zosano's Interim CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.  "These presentations offer a forum to present M207 as a primary treatment option, if approved, for acute migraine sufferers who seek a therapeutic option that is both fast acting at onset and offers a durable response."
Below is a schedule for the oral presentations:

About Migraine
Migraine is the leading cause of disability among neurological disorders in the United States according to the American Migraine Foundation. Migraine symptoms can include moderate to severe headache pain combined with nausea and vomiting, or abnormal sensitivity to light and sound.  According to the Migraine Research Foundation, migraine affects 30 million men, women and children in the United States. Most migraines last between four and 24 hours, but some last as long as three days. According to published studies, 63% of migraine patients experience between one and four migraines per month. According to Decision Resources, prescription drug sales for migraine in the top seven countries were estimated to be $3.3 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow to $4.4 billion in 2020. Triptans, a family of tryptamine-based drugs first sold in the 1990s, account for almost 75% of anti-migraine therapies prescribed at office visits.
About M207
M207 is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan coated onto our patented intracutaneous microneedle patch, which is then applied with our proprietary applicator to ensure uniform and consistent application. In February 2017, the Company announced statistically significant results from the ZOTRIP trial, which demonstrated that the 3.8mg dose of M207 met both co-primary endpoints, achieving pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at 2 hours.  In a Phase 1 trial, M207 demonstrated markedly faster absorption kinetics compared to oral zolmitriptan. The Company presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Headache Society.
About Zosano Pharma
Zosano Pharma Corporation is an emerging CNS company focusing on providing rapid symptom relief to patients using known therapeutics and altering their delivery profile using the Company's proprietary intracutaneous delivery system. The Company's goal is to make intracutaneous drug delivery a standard of care for delivering drugs requiring fast onset of action. Zosano Pharma has developed its proprietary intracutaneous delivery system to administer proprietary formulations of existing drugs through the skin for the treatment of a variety of indications.  The Company believes that its intracutaneous delivery system offers rapid and consistent drug delivery combined with ease of use. The Company is focused on developing products that deliver established molecules with known safety and efficacy profiles for markets where patients remain underserved by existing therapies. Zosano Pharma anticipates that many of its current and future development programs may enable the Company to utilize a regulatory pathway that would streamline clinical development and accelerate the path towards commercialization.
