Firm Profile 




Three decades of assisting investors. Murphy Capital Management was founded in 1983 in Ridgewood, New Jersey with the vision of providing a highly personalized and focused approach to money management for individuals. 


To this day the firm has consistently adhered to a highly sophisticated and totally objective approach in creating wealth and providing the proper asset allocation and risk evaluation for clients who seek a personal and long-term financial relationship. In fact, we still retain a number of original clients who made the creation of Murphy Capital Management possible.
Over the years we have never lost sight of the values and priorities that have allowed us to grow the firm during this thirty-year period. Most of our personnel have been associated with the firm for many years, and this is especially comforting to our long time clients as it provides them with continuity, stability and a working knowledge of their accounts.
It is particularly pleasing to serve a third generation of many initial Murphy Capital Management clients. This legacy is very important to us since the referral of our services to their family and friends is, in many ways, the most gratifying element of our business. As we look ahead to our future growth nothing in our founding principles will change or vary. Murphy Capital Management will always place a client’s objectives and welfare above all else, with integrity and objectivity at the foundation of each relationship.

Wealth Strategies 




Because wealth means different things to different individuals. Murphy Capital helps investors realize
their wealth management objectives through a variety of investment strategies.

Capital Appreciation Growth with No Need for Income Strategy: [+]


The goal is to achieve future capital appreciation, and the strategy seeks to achieve long term competitive rates of return utilizing some or all of the following: equities, equity and fixed income ETFs, MLPs, bonds, closed-end funds, cash and other instruments, with the primary emphasis on equities and/or equity ETFs. The asset allocation typically favors equities which may result in high degrees of portfolio volatility; however the asset allocation can vary greatly depending on MCM’s overall view of the markets. Principal risk and fluctuation is expected and acceptable over the intended long-term investment horizon (in excess of five years).


Moderate Growth and Income Strategy: [+]


The goal is to achieve total return with income using some or all of the following: equities (with the emphasis on dividend paying names), equity and fixed income ETFs, bonds, MLPs, closed-end funds, convertible equity securities and other instruments.  Principal risk and price fluctuation is expected and acceptable over the intended long-term investment horizon (in excess of five years).


Balanced Strategy: [+]


The goal is to achieve both current and future income and capital appreciation. The strategy will look to invest about half of the portfolio in fixed income instruments which may include convertible, government, corporate and municipal bonds as well as fixed income ETFs.  The remaining portion of the portfolio will be invested in equities (with the emphasis on dividend paying names), closed-end funds, MLPs and equity ETFs.  Principal risk and price fluctuation is expected and acceptable over the intended long-term investment horizon (in excess of five years).


Conservative Income Generation Strategy: [+]


The goal is to generate income by investing in cash, government, corporate and municipal bonds with the emphasis primarily on fixed income.  Modest principal fluctuation is expected and acceptable, and the allocation is subject to change at the discretion of MCM dependent upon market conditions.  Interest rate and balance sheet risk may impact this strategy’s overall performance.  Please note that considerable principal risk may result during periods of extreme distress in the fixed income market.


Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and High Income Strategy: [+]


This strategy seeks to achieve growth and income by investing in some or all of the following: Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), equities, equity and fixed income ETFs, bonds, closed-end funds and other instruments. A significant portion of the portfolio will be invested in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and other dividend paying stocks.  MLPs are limited partnerships that are publicly traded and offer yields that may be higher than those of common stocks.  MLPs are subject to regulatory and interest rate risks.  This strategy is generally appropriate for investors with a long investment horizon.  In addition, please note that since this strategy will result in a portfolio with higher sector concentration in sectors such as MLPs, utilities, REITs, etc. As a result, there may be greater portfolio volatility and a higher degree of assumed risk for the overall portfolio.  Please be aware that investors in MLPs will receive K-1s for tax reporting purposes.


Core Options Strategy: [+]


The goal is to achieve capital appreciation and income while incorporating certain options strategies on a portion of the portfolio. The strategy will utilize some or all of the following: options, equities, equity and fixed income ETFs, MLPs, closed-end funds, cash and other instruments. The two primary options strategies utilized are cash (or treasury) secured put writing and covered call writing using individual equities or ETFs (please note that as a result of the cash secured put writes, the portfolio may have a high balance in cash which is being used to secure the short put positions). Put options (i.e. SPY puts) and/or call options (i.e. VXX calls) may be purchased for hedging purposes. Other options strategies such as spreads, collars and buying/selling of call or put options may also be utilized when appropriate opportunities exist.  Unhedged equities and fixed-income securities will typically also be integrated into the portfolio.  Please understand the risks associated with options and that they may not be appropriate for all investors before choosing this strategy. Principal risk and fluctuation are expected and acceptable over the intended long-term investment horizon (in excess of five years). Please see additional disclosure regarding the objective and corresponding risk/reward of implementing an options strategy in the corresponding options disclosure statement provided to each prospect or client who seeks to explore or implement an options strategy.


S&P 500 Dynamic Hedging Strategy: [+]


The goal is to achieve capital appreciation on U.S. large cap equities while managing risk through options hedging. The strategy will invest only in an S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and overlay call and put options on the SPY position with the objective of reducing volatility and potentially generating incremental income. Call options will typically be written on 0% to 70% of the underling SPY position while put options will typically be purchased to cover 30% to 100% of the underlying SPY position. Please note that this strategy will ONLY invest in SPY (thus, it is ALL equities) and its underlying call/put options. Please understand the risks associated with options and that they may not be appropriate for all investors before choosing this strategy. Principal risk and fluctuation are expected and acceptable over the intended long-term investment horizon (in excess of five years). Please see additional disclosure regarding the objective and corresponding risk/reward of implementing an options strategy in the corresponding options disclosure statement provided to each prospect or client who seeks to explore or implement an options strategy.


Options Strategy for Concentrated Position(s): [+]


This strategy is designed for clients with concentrated equity position(s) who do not wish to immediately sell the concentrated position(s) and/or who are looking to sell over a given period of time.  Clients can choose either a covered call strategy or an equity collar strategy to overlay on the concentrated position(s). Covered call writing is an options strategy where call options are written on a stock in an attempt to generate additional income.  An equity collar strategy utilizes both the writing of call options and the buying of protective put options allowing for potential income generation while having some degree of downside protection on the stock. For call options written on a stock, please note that the stock’s potential gains are capped (limited) by the strike price of the call option(s). If you want the call options to be canceled, there could be losses on the option trade, thus resulting in a loss (offset) to the gain from the stock and a loss of potentially greater than the premium that was received for selling the call options. Please note that call options may not be written on the full stock position at all times.  For clients who chose to integrate put options, please note that the portfolio may still experience significant losses depending on the quantity of the puts bought, strike price and expiration dates. Please see additional disclosure regarding the objective and corresponding risk/reward of implementing an options strategy in the corresponding options disclosure statement provided to each prospect or client who seeks to explore or implement an options strategy.

Philosophy 




To A Richer Life.
A richer life lies somewhere beyond the horizon of thoughtfully considered goals and objectives.


In a place where we realize that where we always wanted to be is right where we are.
It comes from realizing dreams. For ourselves. Our families. And for all those we hold dear.
It’s confident and secure. With an unobstructed view of tomorrow’s possibilities.
It lives as a state of mind. A feeling. A place in the heart.
It’s found in an abiding love for life and all that it has to offer.
At times it can be discovered in moments of reflection along our journey in life.
It’s priceless. It’s treasured. And it’s always uniquely personal.
At Murphy Capital Management we consider it a privilege to help you achieve your richer life.
As we look ahead to future growth we remain committed to our founding principals, placing the objectives, welfare and trust of our clients above all else, with integrity, transparency and objectivity as the cornerstones of all our relationships.

Approach 




A truly personalized approach to wealth management.

Past experience through a multitude of market climates has allowed us to better recognize the benefits of proper portfolio diversification and asset allocation. 


While our dedication to building successful, long-lasting relationships is not designed to make us the largest investment firm, we believe it makes us one of the best.
Establish your investment goals one-on-one with Murphy Capital Management to determine…

Your risk assumptions
Your time horizon
Your tax considerations

Allow us to evaluate whether your goals are realistic and properly aligned with your investment risk profile, as well as with the current stock market environment.
 
EXPERIENCED WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Murphy Capital Management provides objective and independent portfolio management and advice to individuals, businesses and foundations. To ensure the highest level of integrity possible…

We do not maintain physical possession of client assets. Assets reside in the custody of an independent brokerage house or other financial institution.
We manage each client’s portfolio separately.
We are accessible and highly responsive to our clients.
We work solely on our clients’ behalf. We are not tied to any product provider or brokerage firm and do not receive any transaction-based commissions. This results in a completely objective approach to the management of your portfolio.
We are a fee-only registered investment management firm. Our fees are based on the value of your portfolio.

 
TRANSPARENCY AND LIQUIDITY
Our portfolio managers take a proactive approach to evaluating a client’s investment objectives so as to be able to manage their financial assets in a stable, accessible and responsible manner. As part of our commitment to the transparency and liquidity of each client’s portfolio:

Assets are held via segregated accounts directly in the name of the client with an unaffiliated custodian
Murphy Capital Management has discretion to initiate trades in the account
Clients receive trade confirmations, statements and direct web access where available, directly from third party custodians

 
TOP-DOWN INVESTMENT PROCESS
Murphy Capital Management employs a top-down approach that enables each client to select from a range of strategic options best suited to their personal goals and wealth management needs. This portfolio customization process is designed to:

Generate and monitor a deep pool of investment ideas through research, screens, watch lists and networks
Analyze industry and business trends
Invest based on return potential versus perceived risk

 
PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
In customizing their portfolio, each Murphy Capital Management client has the ability to select from a wide range of strategic options best suited to their personal goals and wealth management needs. As part of this portfolio construction process:

A laddered approach to risk is taken with portfolios diversified through investments with a range of risk reward levels
Investments are made based on risk/reward potential and are not limited by capitalization measures or index inclusion
Positions are not comparatively weighted against a benchmark or index
Proper portfolio diversification addresses both market and sector risk while not diluting long-term potential

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CEB (NASDAQ:EXBD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
