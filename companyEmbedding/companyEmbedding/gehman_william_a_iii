to Robert Daniel Dreisbach about 1894.�
Robert Daniel Dreisbach was born on July 15, 1872 in Laurys, PA.� He died on June 17, 1942 in Allentown,
PA.�� Robert was apparently the only one
in his family who joined the Mennonites.�
That must have happened early, for he was already licenced to preach in
1892 at about age 20.� He probably
married Nora Brunner, a Mennonite from Zionsville, between 1892 and 1895, the
year when he was ordained a minister.� By
mid 1895 they were living in Upper Black Eddy, PA� (probably his first pastorate), where Paul
Joel was born on June 28, 1895.� He later
served congregations� in Terre Hill
(Lancaster County), and Union Hill up to about 1906, when he disappears from
the church's list of ministers.� It has
been said that he was too often absent from pulpit because he went out hunting
and fishing.� According to Mae, he was
later a fireman on the railroad, and his last employment was as coal (fuel)
inspector for the Lehigh Valley RR.�� He
may have been a furnace salesman for the "Iron Fireman Furnace
Co."� His career was similar to that
of his father.
He was a
committed outdoorsman and an expert at fly-tying.� For about the last 30 years of his life he
lived at 614 N. 8th St. in Allentown, PA.
