Amundi ETF – competitive and innovative 




  
As a leading European ETF Issuer Amundi, stands out for its competitive pricing*, innovation and the quality of the funds available to investors. 






A useful tool in an investor’s portfolioThe global ETF market has grown considerably over the last decade. ETFs, also known as ‘trackers’, aim to replicate as closely as possible the performance of their benchmark index, whether it rises or falls. They combine the advantages of index funds (compliant with European UCITS IV regulations) with those of equities (easy to buy and sell).







A major European player in the ETF market
 Competitive pricing structure*

 Innovative and high quality products

 Amundi ETF assets under management growing faster than the European market1











                    A range of simple, liquid and transparent ETFs, among the least expensive* in the market 
                    





01 | Recognised and trusted expertise Having launched its first funds in 2001, Amundi is recognised as one of the European pioneers in the ETF market.  We currently offer nearly one hundred products, all complying with European UCITS IV standards. Our range of ETFs covers the main asset classes, geographic regions and a large number of sectors and themes. 



02 | Committed to our principlesAmundi’s ETF model is based on three strong and unvarying principles:

Competitive prices.  Our management fees are amongst the lowest in the market - more than 25% cheaper on average than similar European competitors’ products*.
Innovation.  We constantly seek and develop new products - more than a third of our funds were unique to Amundi at the time of their launch.
Product quality due to a proven replication method and clear and transparent information on the funds’ composition.
 



03 | Dedicated local teamsAmundi ETFs are listed on main European stock markets: Euronext Paris, Deutsche Börse, Borsa Italiana, SIX Swiss Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. Dedicated ETF teams are based in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.
