Optika Fund   Just  Submitted Form D  Announcing $14.12 million  Fundraising


05/06/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Optika Fund   Just  Submitted Form D  Announcing $14.12 million  Fundraising and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/optika-fund-just-submitted-form-d-announcing-14-12-million-fundraising/42136/.CaptchaSubmit
Optika Fund  Financing
Optika Fund Llc, Limited Liability Company just  had published form D  because of $14.12 million financing. Optika Fund  was able to  finance itself with $14.12 million. That is 100.00% of the  financing offer. The total  private financing amount was $14.12 million.  The fundraising form was filled on 2015-05-06. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. 
 Optika Fund  is based in Pennsylvania. The  firm’s business is Pooled Investment Fund. The  form was  signed by Geoffrey M Lewis CFO of Managing Member. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 10 East 53Rd Street, 29Th Floor, New York, Ny, New York, 10022.  Optima Group Holdings Llc is the related person in the form and it has address: 10 East 53Rd Street, 29Th Floor, New York, Ny, New York, 10022.
Analysis of Optika Fund  Offering
On average,  firms in the Pooled Investment Fund sector, sell 37.80% of the total offering  amount. Optika Fund  sold 100.00% of the offering.   Could this mean that the trust in Optika Fund  is high? The average  fundraising amount for companies in the Pooled Investment Fund industry is $24.76 million. The offering was 42.98% smaller than the average of $24.76 million.  Of course this should not be  taken as negative.  Businesses  get financed for  a variety of  needs and reasons. The minimum investment for this  financing  was set at $250000. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Optika Fund  Also
Despite Geoffrey M Lewis’s reporting disadvantages, Optika Fund Llc could benefit from this reporting. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
