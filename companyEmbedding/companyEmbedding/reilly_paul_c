	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2011 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500).

Paul C. Reilly, Owner and Executive Chef Archives - The Seasoned Chef Cooking School














































The Seasoned Chef Cooking SchoolCooking Fresh; Eating Fresh...Togetherbeast+bottle – for brunch!
June 10, 2014 · Join Executive Chef and Owner Paul C. Reilly as he gets your weekend well and truly started with some innovative and delicious dishes from his immensely popular Uptown favorite, beast+ bottle. In this hands-on cooking class, under Chef Paul’s informative, upbeat and always entertaining instruction, you’ll be making items that feature on the restaurant’s brunch menu, and combine unique flavor profiles and some serious taste! Already a major player on the Denver dining scene, this hidden gem has won serious praise since its opening, and continues to attract plenty of contented customers through its doors, thanks to Paul’s clever and utterly delicious ‘farm to fork’ style of cooking, which stands firm in its approach to consistently fresh, seasonal and sustainable products. This menu allows an insight into techniques needed to recreate these one-of-a-kind restaurant dishes, perfect for your next morning get-together, and ideal, in fact, at any time of the day! Menu items include: Eggs Benedict with House-made Chicken and Dry Cherry Breakfast Sausage and Mustard Hollandaise; Deep-fried Challah French Toast with Bananas Foster and Chantilly Cream; Fresh Artichoke, Sheep Feta and Three Herb Frittata; Corn Saffron Waffles with Ricotta and Honey; and Duck Confit Crepes with Caramelized Onion, Brie, Pear and Fried Egg. Menu items are subject to Chef’s adjustments.
Foodies Paradise – from Beast + Bottle
December 10, 2013 · Paul Reilly, executive chef and owner of the new, attention-grabbing Uptown gem, Beast + Bottle, has not only been honored to be part of the elite Denver Five, a small group of area chefs dedicated to bringing Colorado national recognition, but he is one of just eight chefs in the world to win the Jean-Louis Palladin Professional Work/Study Grant – an illustrious James Beard Foundation program. His restaurant was recently revealed on Open Table’s coveted list of the 100 restaurants in the U.S. that are most “Fit for Foodies.” (Out of 15,000 review submissions, 4 Colorado restaurants were chosen – 3 of which are in Denver and all are less than a year old!)  A New York native, Paul takes inspiration from his youth in the lush Hudson Valley, sourcing the highest quality ingredients and putting his unique riff on new American cuisine. In this class, Chef Reilly will teach you some of his secrets of working wonders in the kitchen, using incredible ingredient combinations that will explain how he has reached such deserved culinary heights. We will be preparing Baby Parsnips with Peppercorn Panna Cotta, Roasted Grapes and Brussels Sprouts Leaves; Lamb Bacon Flatbread with Pear, Mon Sire Brie and Maple Gastrique; Roasted Quail with Foie Gras, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Butternut Squash and Kumquat; Pappardelle with Braised Lamb Ragout, Ricotta, Arugula and Lemon Oil; and Mascarpone Mousse with Grilled Figs, Almond Sponge and Rooftop Honey. Cocktail Pairing Lil Red Fernet – Fernet Branca, Campari, Aperol and Bordeaux Cherry Juice. Menu may be subject to the Chef’s adjustments.
