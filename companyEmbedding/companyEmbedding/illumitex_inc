History[edit]
Illumitex was founded in 2005 by Matt Thomas, Dung Duong, and Paul Winberg.[4] The company largely stayed under the radar until they began receiving funding in 2008. They raised $10.5 million in a B round of funding in 2008 and, in 2009, added an additional $10 million in another round.[5] By 2010, the company had received around $22 million in investor funding from groups like New Enterprise Associates,[6] DFJ Mercury, and Applied Ventures.[4] Also in 2010, Illumitex released its first product line (dubbed "Aduro")[6] which consisted of square-shaped LED lights that could theoretically provide more light coverage than traditional rounded LED lights. The company's original goal was to provide residential and commercial lighting solutions for indoor rooms, parking lots, streetlights, and more.[7][8] One of Illumitex's early clients was an apartment complex in Singapore.[9] In 2011, Illumitex added an additional $13.5 million in equity.[5]
In April 2012, the company received an additional $9.3 million from existing investors, bringing the total money raised to $50.3 million. The company continued to pursue options in vertical farming, contained environmental agriculture, and tissue culture laboratories as well as general illumination.[10] Illumitex had 35 employees in 2012.[11] The company raised $3.8 million in 2013[12] and added around $6 million in 2014. In August 2014, Illumitex announced plans to double the size of its headquarters.[11] In 2015, the company secured $16 million in a funding round led by WP Global Partners.[1] As of 2015, greenhouses account for the largest portion of Illumitex's customer base. The company has also provided lighting to prominent vertical farms like the Chicago-based FarmHere, which provides crops to Whole Foods.[3]
Products[edit]
As of 2015, most of Illumitex's products are used in contained environmental agriculture and vertical farming operations. The company produces a wide range of LED lights with customized intensity and wavelengths. The company's lights produce the "theoretical maximum amount of light for photosynthesis."[3] Illumitex also produces its own fixtures and other lighting accessories. Everything that goes into light construction (e.g. phosphors, dies, packaging, etc.) is produced by an Illumitex factory.[13] Illumitex lights have been used to grow plants like tomatoes, basil, kale, and other vegetables. Marijuana is also frequently grown under Illumitex lights. The company is also producing an LED light that uses a specific wavelength to kill acne-causing bacteria. Illumitex also makes patented LED white light fixtures for the food-processing industry and for architecture.[3]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2015, the Austin Chamber of Commerce listed Illumitex among its class of A-List Startups. The list identifies the 12 "most promising" startups in the Austin area.[14][15]

They raised $10.5 million in a B round of funding in 2008 and, in 2009, added an additional $10 million in another round.[5] By 2010, the company had received around $22 million in investor funding from groups like New Enterprise Associates,[6] DFJ Mercury, and Applied Ventures.[4] Also in 2010, Illumitex released its first product line (dubbed "Aduro")[6] which consisted of square-shaped LED lights that could theoretically provide more light coverage than traditional rounded LED lights. The company's original goal was to provide residential and commercial lighting solutions for indoor rooms, parking lots, streetlights, and more.[7][8] One of Illumitex's early clients was an apartment complex in Singapore.[9] In 2011, Illumitex added an additional $13.5 million in equity.[5]
In April 2012, the company received an additional $9.3 million from existing investors, bringing the total money raised to $50.3 million. The company continued to pursue options in vertical farming, contained environmental agriculture, and tissue culture laboratories as well as general illumination.[10] Illumitex had 35 employees in 2012.[11] The company raised $3.8 million in 2013[12] and added around $6 million in 2014. In August 2014, Illumitex announced plans to double the size of its headquarters.[11] In 2015, the company secured $16 million in a funding round led by WP Global Partners.[1] As of 2015, greenhouses account for the largest portion of Illumitex's customer base. The company has also provided lighting to prominent vertical farms like the Chicago-based FarmHere, which provides crops to Whole Foods.[3]
Products[edit]
As of 2015, most of Illumitex's products are used in contained environmental agriculture and vertical farming operations. The company produces a wide range of LED lights with customized intensity and wavelengths. The company's lights produce the "theoretical maximum amount of light for photosynthesis."[3] Illumitex also produces its own fixtures and other lighting accessories. Everything that goes into light construction (e.g. phosphors, dies, packaging, etc.) is produced by an Illumitex factory.[13] Illumitex lights have been used to grow plants like tomatoes, basil, kale, and other vegetables. Marijuana is also frequently grown under Illumitex lights. The company is also producing an LED light that uses a specific wavelength to kill acne-causing bacteria. Illumitex also makes patented LED white light fixtures for the food-processing industry and for architecture.[3]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2015, the Austin Chamber of Commerce listed Illumitex among its class of A-List Startups. The list identifies the 12 "most promising" startups in the Austin area.[14][15]

Illumitex Inc.
 






Illumitex is an industry-leading manufacturer of precision LEDs and LED lights. Illumitex has radically transformed traditional LED design with the creation of LED  lighting that emits a uniform, highly precise beam directly from the source.  With die-level optical integration, cumbersome and inefficient secondary optics to control light are unnecessary, opening the world to more versatile—and energy efficient—lighting applications than ever before imagined.

Founded in 2005 in Austin, Texas, by semiconductor...
                    


Founded in 2005 in Austin, Texas, by semiconductor and optics industry veterans, Illumitex’s industry-shifting achievements began with a fresh approach to traditional LED design. By refusing to settle for the losses associated with secondary optics, Illumitex engineers utilized fundamental physics principles to maximize light extraction from the source. By extracting and directing photons at the die level, Illumitex delivers more usable light to the intended target while consuming less energy. All of this is achieved in the smallest form factor available on the market. With this innovative design shift, Illumitex promises to lead the LED lighting industry into a new realm of possibilities.White-light applications of Illumitex’s products include warehouses, offices, commercial landscapes, cold storage, food processing, grocery display and building exteriors. Horticultural lighting applications include grow lights for large growers, indoor gardens, vertical farms, greenhouses, grow containers and green walls.For the general lighting industry, Illumitex technology enables the development of smaller and more efficient lighting solutions that improve quality of light—and life—wherever LEDs are used. For architectural lighting designers, Illumitex LEDs inspire creativity with the ability to “paint with light” by delivering perfectly uniform color blending precisely to the intended target. For the horticulture industry, Illumitex LED lights deliver custom-spectra photons directly and uniformly on plants, allowing growers to produce plants in less time and with less energy.

The result: with die-level optical integration, the need for cumbersome and inefficient secondary optics to control light is obsolete, opening the world to more versatile and energy efficient lighting applications than ever before imagined. For the horticulture industry, Illumitex LEDs deliver custom-spectra photons directly and uniformly on plants, allowing growers to produce plants in less time and with less energy.

                                              Pricing
                                                      Starting at $740.                                                
                                              Notes
                        The Stratus is available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including round, square and rectangular with lumen packages equivalent to 175W, 250W, 400W, 750W and 1000W MH.                                          






                Illumitex, Inc.            

                Illumitex has radically transformed traditional LED design and greatly increased functionality with the creation of an LED package that emits light in a uniform, highly-precise beam directly from the source. The result: with die-level optical integration, the need for cumbersome and inefficient secondary optics to control light is obsolete, opening the world to more versatile and energy efficient lighting applications than ever before imagined. For the horticulture industry, Illumitex LEDs deliver custom-spectra photons directly and uniformly on plants, allowing growers to produce plants in less time and with less energy.

Are your products UL listed?Our products are ETL listed. The ETL Listed Mark is an alternative to UL listed marks. Like UL, ETL “demonstrates compliance to the requirements of widely accepted product safety standards” and both are accredited by the Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (which is part of OSHA)  to test to these standards. In passing ETL tests, Illumitex products are certified to meet rigorous standards for electrical safety and electromagnetic emissions.
ETL Testing Laboratories has been conducting electrical performance and reliability tests since 1896. Intertek Testing Services (ITS) acquired ETL from Inchcape in 1996. ITS is recognized by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL), just as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and several other independent organizations are recognized.
ITS tests products according to nearly 200 safety and performance standards. The ETL Listed Mark and C-ETL Listed Mark are accepted throughout the United States and Canada when denoting compliance with nationally recognized standards such as ANSI, IEC, UL, and CSA.
This certification mark indicates that the product has been tested to and has met the minimum requirements of a widely recognized (consensus) U.S. product safety standard, that the manufacturing site has been audited, and that the applicant has agreed to a program of periodic factory follow-up inspections to verify continued conformance.
Can your products be used in damp/wet locations such as grow rooms or where food processing takes place?Almost all Illumitex LEDs are IP66 rated, meaning they are dust-tight and water-tight at the LED package level. Because they can be washed down along with everything else in a food-processing environment, they are safe and efficient additions to this type of setting. In an indoor growing situation, Illumitex IP66 rated LED horticulture lights are equally safe from irrigation dampness.
Do you warranty your LED lights?illumitex offers a 5-year limited warranty on our LED light fixtures to the original purchaser with a valid receipt.
Do your products work in cold environments?Illumitex products absolutely work in cold environments. Illumitex LED luminaires are the perfect solution for a broad range of industrial applications, including cold storage, freezer and cold food processing. While fluorescent and other technologies can be adversely affected by cold temperatures, this is not an issue with LED lights. LEDs love the cold.
How are Illumitex LEDs different from other LED lights?Illumitex's patented LED package technology offers perfect edge-to-edge color uniformity. Illumitex LEDs emit light directly from the die in a uniform and precise beam and our die-level optical integration means there's no need for large, inefficient secondary optics. We deliver the highest center beam candle power (CBCP) and deliver more uniform light to the intended target than any other LED and optical system on the market.
How do I buy Illumitex products?Illumitex LED lighting products are sold through stocking distribution or through select hydroponic and indoor gardening centers.
How will LED lights make my life easier?Illumitex LED Lighting products are designed to last for tens of thousands of hours — many times the life of a typical incandescent bulb and 5 times the lifetime of an average compact fluorescent lamp (CFL). Incredible longevity means that you might never change another light again, and at the very least, you'll have significantly lower maintenance and labor expenses. In addition, Illumitex offers simple retrofit solutions, so converting from old technology to LED is easy.
What are the advantages of using LED fixtures?LEDs offer many advantages over legacy light sources, including extreme durability and high efficacy. Their superior lifespan, when compared to other lighting types, means their required maintenance and need for replacement is great reduced. This means LED lights offer great maintenance savings, energy savings and environmental sustainability. LED lights can offer greater optical control, instant on/off, dimming, and reduced rate of lumen depreciation. LEDs also produce a significantly smaller amount of heat than traditional HID lights.
Where can I find .ies files for your products?To find .ies files of Illumitex products, click on the Illumitex LED product page of the light you are interested in; there you will see a Photometry tab, which will provide you with downloadable .ies files.

illumitex is an industry-leading manufacturer of precision LEDs and LED luminaires
illumitex has radically transformed traditional LED design with the creation of LED  lighting that emits a uniform, highly precise beam directly from the source.  With die-level optical integration, cumbersome and inefficient secondary optics to control light are unnecessary, opening the world to more versatile—and energy efficient—lighting applications than ever before imagined.
Founded in 2005 in Austin, Texas, by semiconductor and optics industry veterans, illumitex’s industry-shifting achievements began with a fresh approach to traditional LED design. By refusing to settle for the losses associated with secondary optics, illumitex engineers utilized fundamental physics principles to maximize light extraction from the source. By extracting and directing photons at the die level, Illumitex delivers more usable light to the intended target while consuming less energy. All of this is achieved in the smallest form factor available on the market. With this innovative design shift, illumitex promises to lead the LED lighting industry into a new realm of possibilities.
White-light applications of Illumitex’s products include warehouses, offices, commercial landscapes, cold storage, food processing, grocery display and building exteriors. Horticultural lighting applications include grow lights for large growers, indoor gardens, vertical farms, greenhouses, grow containers and green walls.
For the general lighting industry, illumitex technology enables the development of smaller and more efficient lighting solutions that improve quality of light—and life—wherever LEDs are used. For architectural lighting designers, illumitex LEDs inspire creativity with the ability to “paint with light” by delivering perfectly uniform color blending precisely to the intended target. For the horticulture industry, Illumitex LED lights deliver custom-spectra photons directly and uniformly on plants, allowing growers to produce plants in less time and with less energy.
