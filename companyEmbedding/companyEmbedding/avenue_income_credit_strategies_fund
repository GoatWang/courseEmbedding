An investment in the Avenue Income Credit Strategies Fund (the “Fund”) is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program.  The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment.  Investors should read the prospectus and consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.  Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors’ risk of loss. Please see the Disclosure section for an explanation of the Fund’s primary risks.  Before investing you should carefully read the Fund’s prospectus and consider carefully the risks that you assume when you invest in the Fund’s common shares.  The Adviser provides similar investment advisory services to other clients, including private funds, and has implemented a Security Overlap Limitation.  Please see the Disclosure section for an explanation of this Security Overlap Limitation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.  The Fund is not sold by Avenue Capital Group or any affiliate of Avenue Capital Group.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avenue Income Credit Strategies Fund (NYSE:ACP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
