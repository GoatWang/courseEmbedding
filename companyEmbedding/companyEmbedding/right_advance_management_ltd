                    They are senior managers who have been at the forefront of driving the evolution of IT management solutions to meet New Zealand’s most complex employment conditions.
                






Noel Reid - Founding Director
The opportunity that drove the formation of AMS 35 years ago was the introduction of real-time processing to the insurance sector; Noel was a co-founder.  Noel notes “We’ve always thrived on innovating within complex environments. From the beginning its been all about the Customers.  We’ve always sought partnerships, to help ensure the innovation is practical.  Our focus has always been around the best possible outcomes for our Customers, hence earning us the right to a long term relationship.  We aspire to “go the extra mile” and then some!!”
                            






Joseph Yip - CEO
Joseph joined AMS out of the University of Auckland 30 years ago with a BSc in computer science. Since that time he has been part of virtually every aspect of AMS’ development.

Nikki worked with LEADER at ACC in Wellington, when she moved to Auckland to start a family, AMS offered her a casual contract to help implement a new client and she never left. She has been in many roles within AMS and enjoys getting stuck in and working with customers to solve their problems.  
                        Nikki thinks that AMS as a company recognises and appreciates the individuality and skill of its employees – there is a great deal of mutual trust within the AMS environment which benefits the company as a whole. 
                        She says she has seen a shift in the company over the last few years: AMS is now a more focussed and driven company with many exciting times ahead, capitalising on its people’s vast experiences and knowledge - investing in products and delivering benefit where most needed.

Nick Schubert - Software Development & IT Manager
Nick says he was almost fresh out of university when he joined the AMS, attracted by its exciting technical IT development that was unique in NZ, including developing its own platform and database engine. Nick believes the core foundations of enterprise level software systems need to be engineered to standards and perform so they remain beneath the consciousness of the enterprise. When he’s not doing R&D, Nick also looks after client hosting at AMS’ datacentre.
