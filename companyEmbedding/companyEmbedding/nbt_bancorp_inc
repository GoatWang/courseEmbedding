Chairman Martin A. Dietrich and President & CEO John H. Watt Jr.


Watt appointed NBT President and CEO, Dietrich continues as Chairman of the Board
  
        On Monday, December 19, 2016, NBT Bancorp Inc. announced that the Board of Directors appointed John H. Watt Jr. as President and CEO of NBT Bancorp and NBT Bank. Watt was also elected to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Martin A. Dietrich, who announced his plans to retire earlier this year, will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board. 

        "I have enjoyed working closely with John and NBT's Executive Management Team to orchestrate this seamless transition with the support of our employees and directors," said Dietrich. "I am confident that John will continue to lead NBT to achieve new milestones that meet the needs of current and future customers and create lasting shareholder value in a manner consistent with our community banking values. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to have worked with so many talented and dedicated people during my career at NBT, and I look forward to continuing in my role as Chairman."
        Watt added, "I am excited and honored to assume leadership of the highly successful team at NBT. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to drive the Company's continued growth for the benefit of our shareholders and customers. It has been my privilege to work with Marty Dietrich this year on the leadership transition, and I look forward to a long and successful partnership with him in his role as Chairman."
        

        Watt has 30 years of experience in banking and financial services. He joined NBT in 2014 and has played an expanding role providing executive leadership for a number of key areas, including commercial and consumer lending, credit administration and marketing. He was promoted to Executive Vice President and joined NBT's Executive Management Team in 2015.
        

        Prior to joining NBT, Watt was Executive Vice President of commercial banking, investment management and bank operations at Alliance Bank, N.A. He was also a member of the Board of Directors for Alliance Bank and Alliance Financial Corporation. Previously, he was employed by JP Morgan Chase and its upstate New York predecessors.
        

        Dietrich began his career in financial services with NBT in 1981. He joined the Bank's Senior Management Team in 1995. Dietrich became President of the Bank in 2000; advanced to President and CEO of the Bank and President of NBT in 2004; and ultimately became CEO of NBT in 2006. He joined the Bank Board of Directors in 1993 and NBT's Board of Directors in 2005.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
Founded in 1856, NBT Bank was first a state-chartered bank called the Bank of Norwich. On June 28, 1865, the bank received a national charter (which it holds to this day)[4] and changed its name to the National Bank of Norwich. In 1918, NBT Bank was one of the first national banks in New York State to apply for and receive trust powers under a Federal Reserve act and established a Trust Department. In 1925, NBT Bank changed its name a second time to better reflect its expanded services. Over the years, the area served by NBT Bank expanded and in 1989 the bank changed its name for the third time to The National Bank and Trust Company without "of Norwich." In 1995, the bank changed its name for the fourth time to NBT Bank, N.A. (The "N.A." stands for "National Association" and is used primarily in formal or legal contexts.) At the same time, NBT Bank introduced its current logo featuring a blue star and red lettering.
In 2016, NBT Bank celebrated its 160th year in business and published an updated history of the bank to commemorate this milestone.[5]
Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
NBT Bank completed its first acquisitions in the 1930s. Since that time, the bank has continued to grow through bank and branch acquisitions as well as through organic expansion.
Since 2000, NBT Bank acquired the following banks: LA Bank based in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 2000; Pioneer American Bank based in Carbondale, Pennsylvania in 2000; First National Bank of Northern New York based in Norfolk, New York in 2001; Central National Bank based in Canajoharie, New York in 2001; City National Bank and Trust Company based in Gloversville, New York in 2005; Hampshire First Bank based in Manchester, New Hampshire in 2012; and Alliance Bank based in Syracuse, New York in 2013. The merger with Alliance Bank was completed on March 8[6] and is NBT Bank's largest to date.
Naming Rights[edit]
NBT Bank owns the naming rights to NBT Bank Stadium in Syracuse, New York.

History[edit]
Founded in 1856, NBT Bank was first a state-chartered bank called the Bank of Norwich. On June 28, 1865, the bank received a national charter (which it holds to this day)[4] and changed its name to the National Bank of Norwich. In 1918, NBT Bank was one of the first national banks in New York State to apply for and receive trust powers under a Federal Reserve act and established a Trust Department. In 1925, NBT Bank changed its name a second time to better reflect its expanded services. Over the years, the area served by NBT Bank expanded and in 1989 the bank changed its name for the third time to The National Bank and Trust Company without "of Norwich." In 1995, the bank changed its name for the fourth time to NBT Bank, N.A. (The "N.A." stands for "National Association" and is used primarily in formal or legal contexts.) At the same time, NBT Bank introduced its current logo featuring a blue star and red lettering.
In 2016, NBT Bank celebrated its 160th year in business and published an updated history of the bank to commemorate this milestone.[5]
Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
NBT Bank completed its first acquisitions in the 1930s. Since that time, the bank has continued to grow through bank and branch acquisitions as well as through organic expansion.
Since 2000, NBT Bank acquired the following banks: LA Bank based in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 2000; Pioneer American Bank based in Carbondale, Pennsylvania in 2000; First National Bank of Northern New York based in Norfolk, New York in 2001; Central National Bank based in Canajoharie, New York in 2001; City National Bank and Trust Company based in Gloversville, New York in 2005; Hampshire First Bank based in Manchester, New Hampshire in 2012; and Alliance Bank based in Syracuse, New York in 2013. The merger with Alliance Bank was completed on March 8[6] and is NBT Bank's largest to date.
Naming Rights[edit]
NBT Bank owns the naming rights to NBT Bank Stadium in Syracuse, New York.

NBT Bancorp Inc. Elects New Chairman, Announces Succession Plan and Expanded Executive Roles





NORWICH, NY (May 4, 2016) – The Board of Directors of NBT Bancorp Inc. (NBT) (NASDAQ: NBTB) elected President and CEO Martin A. Dietrich to the position of chairman on May 3, 2016, following the retirement of Daryl R. Forsythe. Dietrich also announced his intention to retire from active employment in December 2016.
Dietrich began his career in financial services with NBT Bank, N.A. (the Bank) in 1981. He joined the Bank’s senior management team in 1995. Dietrich became president of the Bank in 2000; advanced to president and CEO of the Bank and president of NBT in 2004; and ultimately became CEO of NBT in 2006. He joined the Bank Board of Directors in 1993 and NBT’s Board of Directors in 2005. Dietrich is a graduate of Colgate University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics.
The NBT Board of Directors also unanimously endorsed a succession plan that calls for the promotion of John H. Watt, Jr. to the position of president of the Bank effective immediately and expanded roles for other members of NBT’s Executive Management Team. Upon Dietrich’s retirement from active employment, Watt will succeed him as chief executive officer of NBT and the Bank.
“NBT has benefited from consistent leadership for several decades,” said Dietrich. “We are pleased to have the resources within our organization to create this succession plan. The Board’s unanimous endorsement of the plan speaks to the high level of confidence they have in John Watt and NBT’s entire Executive Management Team.”
Watt joined NBT in 2014 to lead the Bank’s expansion into Maine and establish a regional headquarters in Portland. Since joining NBT, his role has expanded to provide executive leadership for credit administration, consumer lending, marketing and product development. He was promoted to executive vice president and joined NBT’s Executive Management Team in 2015.

He was also president of MTB Funds and M&T Life Insurance Company. He holds a Certified Financial Planner designation. He earned his Bachelor’s Degree from Kalamazoo College and his Master’s Degree in Education from John Carroll University.
Executive Vice President Matthew K. Durkee was promoted to the position of president of New England. Durkee joined NBT in 2009 to lead the Bank’s expansion into Vermont. His leadership responsibilities have expanded as the Bank’s presence in New England has grown to include Massachusetts, New Hampshire and now Maine. He also provides executive oversight for the Bank’s Residential Mortgage Division. Durkee was promoted to executive vice president and joined NBT’s Executive Management Team in 2015.
Durkee has over 30 years of experience in financial services.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
