Top record matches for Thomas Johnston Hall






Surname meaning for "Hall"
English, Scottish, Irish, German, and Scandinavian: from Middle
English hall (Old English heall), Middle High German
halle, Old Norse holl all meaning ‘hall’ (a spacious
residence), hence a topographic name for someone who lived in or near
a hall or an occupational name for a servant employed at a hall. In
some cases it may be a habitational name from places named with this
word, which in some parts of Germany and Austria in the Middle Ages
also denoted a salt mine. The English name has been established in
Ireland since the Middle Ages, and, according to MacLysaght, has become
numerous in Ulster since the 17th century.
