McKesson Completes Acquisition of Rexall Health and Appoints Domenic Pilla as CEO of McKesson Canada
December 28, 2016








Agreement reached with Competition Bureau of Canada for acquisition of Rexall Health and acquisition approved under Investment Canada Act. 
Canadians will benefit from greater choice and access, integrated pharmacy care, and industry-leading service levels. 
    Domenic Pilla to provide overall leadership for McKesson Canada, including Rexall Health; Jürgen Schreiber to pursue other opportunities.


 SAN FRANCISCO and TORONTO, December 28, 2016 — McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), a leading international healthcare services and information technology company, announced today that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of Rexall Health for $2.9 billion CAD ($2.1 billion USD*, or approximately $1.7 billion USD*, net of certain estimated purchase price adjustments, proceeds from store divestitures, and tax benefits). This follows the agreement reached with the Competition Bureau of Canada for the acquisition of Rexall Health and approval received under the Investment Canada Act.

As part of the transaction, McKesson has acquired approximately 470 retail pharmacies, and has agreed to divest stores in 26 local markets that the Competition Bureau of Canada identified during its review of the transaction.

McKesson also announced today that Domenic Pilla has been appointed CEO of McKesson Canada, effective January 3, 2017. Pilla will report to Paul C. Julian, executive vice president and group president, McKesson Corporation, and assume overall leadership responsibility for McKesson’s distribution and retail businesses in Canada, including Rexall Health. Jürgen Schreiber, currently CEO of Rexall Health, will leave to pursue other opportunities.

“Today’s announcement marks a milestone for McKesson and Rexall Health. With complementary assets, industry expertise, and shared values, we will now serve our customers with enhanced retail pharmacy capabilities and a broader reach across Canada,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson Corporation. “Patients across Canada will benefit from best-in-class pharmacy care through innovative care solutions and an expanded retail footprint. We are thankful to Daryl Katz, founder and chairman of Katz Group, one of Canada’s largest privately-owned enterprises, for having built such a strong pharmacy asset in the Canadian market.”

With Rexall Health, McKesson will be able to serve a broad range of pharmaceutical care and ensure choice to consumers at a time when Canadians are increasingly turning to pharmacies for their healthcare advice and services.

“Together, McKesson and Rexall can leverage shared expertise to grow and deliver better care and value to Canadians,” said Julian. “McKesson has a strong track record of delivering leading service levels to customers and patients.”

“Domenic Pilla is uniquely qualified to lead our expanded portfolio in Canada based on his previous experience as president of Shoppers Drug Mart and McKesson Canada,” Julian continued. “He brings deep knowledge of both the wholesale and retail sides of the business, and a proven track record of delivering results. We thank Jürgen Schreiber for his outstanding leadership in bringing this acquisition to fruition and wish him the greatest success.”

Rexall Health will continue to have a dedicated management team in Canada under Pilla, while retaining the existing brand Canadians have come to know and trust. Pilla is expected to appoint a new president of Rexall Health in the future to provide day-to-day leadership for Rexall. His other direct report will be Paula Keays, president of McKesson Canada.

McKesson now expects Rexall Health to be flat to adjusted earnings per diluted share for Fiscal 2017 as earnings attributable to Rexall Health will be offset by an anticipated charge related to a fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. McKesson expects the acquisition will be 30 to 35 cents accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share by the third year following the close of the transaction, on a constant currency basis.

Pilla: Canada to benefit from SDM, Loblaw merger
June 2, 2014

The acquisition of Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. by Loblaw Cos. will benefit both companies and the Canadian consumer, according to SDM president Domenic Pilla.
SDM will bolster its food offerings with Loblaw's grocery expertise and experience, while the supermarket retailer will enhance its health care offerings by tapping the drug chain's pharmacy capabilities. "It’s about complementarity," Pilla said in an interview with Chain Drug Review.TORONTO — The acquisition of Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. by Loblaw Cos. will benefit both companies, according to SDM president Domenic Pilla.

The Canadian drug chain will bolster its food offerings with Loblaw’s grocery expertise and experience, while the supermarketer will enhance its health care offerings by tapping the drug chain’s pharmacy capabilities. “It’s about complementarity,” Pilla said in an interview with Chain Drug Review.
Canada as a whole should gain from the deal, he added, because the combined entity will foster a convergence of health and nutrition. “It’s a huge opportunity, and it can have a much larger impact than either of us could have on our own on Canada’s health care system.”
Loblaw has pioneered the reduction of sodium and processed sugars from food as well as the elimination of additives, especially in private label products. Said Pilla, “It’s fun to be working with another company that is just as iconic and has made so much progress in its area of expertise.”
The nearly nine months it took for regulators to approve the purchase has allowed for extensive planning. One result is that SDM will add food this year, especially from Loblaw’s President’s Choice private label line. The brand’s well-known Decadent Chocolate Chip cookies already are selling well at the drug stores. SDM’s Life brand vitamins, meanwhile, have caught on at Loblaw.
“We were ready to go and pulled that trigger and it was executed brilliantly by both teams, and the response by the customers has been overwhelming,” said Pilla. “We were very pleased at the response of the customer to the brands in each other’s formats.”
One distinction between the retailers will be in pharmacy. Loblaw and SDM pharmacies will retain separate banners, although the chains will collaborate on programs. To that end Jeff Leger, who was SDM’s senior vice president of pharmaceutical partnerships, has been promoted to head of Loblaw pharmacies.
While Health Canada administrators trying to curb costs have targeted pharmacy reimbursements, the pricing of generics has been stabilized. “What we have now for the first time is a three-year national arrangement,” Pilla said. “That’s going to be very good for the ­industry.”
Also, five provinces allowed pharmacy reimbursements for flu shots last season, and three more will join them this year. Negotiations are ongoing with the two holdouts.
Alberta has taken the lead in granting pharmacists a wide range of prescribing rights, making it “a world leader in terms of expanding the scope of practice,” noted Pilla. “It’s a great model we’d like to see elsewhere.”
Already, other provinces are allowing pharmacist prescribing for minor ailments. Also, authorization for other inoculations besides flu shots is on the horizon.
“We’re quite encouraged by the new reimbursed services,” Pilla remarked, noting that some provinces have committed to reinvesting generics savings into expanding pharmacy practice. In New Brunswick, 30% of savings will go to expanded services, he pointed out. “That kind of target setting is very encouraging. That is the silver lining of the drug reform initiatives.”
SDM is responding to the trend by transforming its pharmacy business from a product-centric to patient-centered, service-oriented operation.
“We’ve been on that path,” Pilla said, noting that its foundation will be the chain’s relaunched Health Watch NG pharmacy system. “When we launch that in 2014 we think it will give us the functionality and capability to truly expand our new professional services and deliver them seamlessly and efficiently. Clearly we would like the governments to come along with us, but we made that decision regardless. Our pharmacies are going to be transformed.”
The transformation will include significantly greater use by pharmacies of electronic medical records, he noted, especially as doctors increasingly use the technology for disease state management. Already pharmacists have provided tremendous support to multidisciplinary family health care teams.
In the front end, SDM sees an opportunity to bring its market-leading beauty merchandising to Loblaw. It can offer capabilities in product innovation, store-level support and sourcing to grow Loblaw’s beauty business, said Pilla.
“We don’t see just taking share, but actually growing the categories. That’s what makes us excited. We’ve shown that our partnerships with vendors are not just about growing share. We’ve added incremental sales. We’ve exposed more Canadians to new products and product regimens.”
The latest beauty trends come out of cities, and Pilla noted that urbanization is reshaping Canada nationwide. SDM has a significant presence in urban markets, and the economies of scale it’s gaining from Loblaw are bringing its urban customers a new value proposition, he said.
The drug chain’s beauty advisers have won over consumers with unbiased service and personal relationships. The relationships have been enhanced with digital technology, Pilla said, noting that SDM’s upscale Murale beauty business is providing a laboratory for ­e-commerce.
Generally, he added, SDM stands to benefit substantially from Loblaw’s e-commerce capability. “Becoming an omnichannel company where people can experience our brand across any platform that they wish to interact with will be an important part of our ­development.”
The overall relationship between the two chains will be mutually beneficial, he emphasized. “We’re going to look at best practices across both organizations and help each other get better.”
The acquisition at heart is more about sales growth than cost cutting, he added. “Long term, that’s by far the biggest synergy, which makes it exciting and engaging for employees.”

 McKesson Completes Acquisition of Rexall Health 
 Thu, 12/29/2016 - 7:30am 
 Comments 
 by McKesson Corporation  

 






 



McKesson completes acquisition of Rexall Health and appoints Domenic Pilla as CEO of McKesson Canada.
McKesson Corporation, an international healthcare services and information technology company, announced that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of Rexall Health for C$2.9 billion (US$2.1 billion*, or approximately US$1.7 billion*, net of certain estimated purchase price adjustments, proceeds from store divestitures, and tax benefits). This follows the agreement reached with the Competition Bureau of Canada for the acquisition of Rexall Health and approval received under the Investment Canada Act.
As part of the transaction, McKesson has acquired approximately 470 retail pharmacies, and has agreed to divest stores in 26 local markets that the Competition Bureau of Canada identified during its review of the transaction.
McKesson also announced today that Domenic Pilla has been appointed CEO of McKesson Canada, effective January 3, 2017. Pilla will report to Paul C. Julian, executive vice president and group president, McKesson Corporation, and assume overall leadership responsibility for McKesson’s distribution and retail businesses in Canada, including Rexall Health. Jürgen Schreiber, currently CEO of Rexall Health, will leave to pursue other opportunities.
“Today’s announcement marks a milestone for McKesson and Rexall Health. With complementary assets, industry expertise, and shared values, we will now serve our customers with enhanced retail pharmacy capabilities and a broader reach across Canada,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson Corporation. “Patients across Canada will benefit from best-in-class pharmacy care through innovative care solutions and an expanded retail footprint. We are thankful to Daryl Katz, founder and chairman of Katz Group, one of Canada’s largest privately-owned enterprises, for having built such a strong pharmacy asset in the Canadian market.”
With Rexall Health, McKesson will be able to serve a broad range of pharmaceutical care and ensure choice to consumers at a time when Canadians are increasingly turning to pharmacies for their healthcare advice and services.
“Together, McKesson and Rexall can leverage shared expertise to grow and deliver better care and value to Canadians,” said Julian. “McKesson has a strong track record of delivering leading service levels to customers and patients.”
“Domenic Pilla is uniquely qualified to lead our expanded portfolio in Canada based on his previous experience as president of Shoppers Drug Mart and McKesson Canada,” Julian continued. “He brings deep knowledge of both the wholesale and retail sides of the business, and a proven track record of delivering results. We thank Jürgen Schreiber for his outstanding leadership in bringing this acquisition to fruition and wish him the greatest success.”
Rexall Health will continue to have a dedicated management team in Canada under Pilla, while retaining the existing brand Canadians have come to know and trust. Pilla is expected to appoint a new president of Rexall Health in the future to provide day-to-day leadership for Rexall. His other direct report will be Paula Keays, president of McKesson Canada.
McKesson now expects Rexall Health to be flat to adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2017 as earnings attributable to Rexall Health will be offset by an anticipated charge related to a fair value adjustment of acquired inventory. McKesson expects the acquisition will be 30 to 35 cents accretive to adjusted earnings per diluted share by the third year following the close of the transaction, on a constant currency basis.
