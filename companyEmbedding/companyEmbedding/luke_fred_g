Fred Luke Assumes Duties as President and Director of Green Automotive






January 11, 2011 02:58 PM Eastern Standard Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Green Automotive Company Corporation (Pink Sheets: GACR) announced today 
      the appointment of Fred G. Luke as its new President and a Director, 
      replacing Stephen Aust as President and Director, who resigned last week.
    


      Earlier the Company accepted the resignations of Dan Elliott, Ben 
      Rainwater and Thad Balkman as Directors. “This change was not due to any 
      disagreement between the resigning Directors and the Company,” said 
      Frederick Steven Wells, the Company’s founder and remaining Director. 
      “This management change is the result of the inability of the former 
      Board members to meet the short-term objectives mandated by the group of 
      the Company’s shareholders who, last November, effected the expansion of 
      the Board and election of these additional Directors.”
    

      Wells added, “I want to clarify things and assure our investors and 
      shareholders that the Company is continuing to move forward with our 
      present corporate development plans and product launch.
    

      “Over the past six months I have been working with Fred Luke, President 
      of Global Market Advisors Inc., in an effort to restructure the Company, 
      attract capable management, create a more effective organizational 
      structure, improve the Company’s Balance Sheet and attract sources of 
      investment capital necessary to bring our All-Electric Vehicles to the 
      US market,” said Mr. Wells.
    

      Wells added, “Our plan involves several steps. While Mr. Luke has been 
      successful in guiding the Company through the financial and regulatory 
      reporting process, and in eliminating most if not all of the Company’s 
      debt prior to the end of 2010, other elements of our development plan 
      remained unfinished. Following the recent return of the Green Auto 
      Directors from China, Mr. Luke, and the Company’s Investment Banking 
      team mutually agreed that the Company was ready to make the transition 
      from development-stage to pre-operational and, to enable us to attract 
      the necessary long-term capital and execute our long-term objectives, 
      changes needed to be made.
    

      “Fred Luke has over 40 years of experience in the domestic and 
      international finance, mergers and the management of private and 
      publicly held companies,” said Mr. Wells. “Fred has been instrumental in 
      the development of companies in various business segments, including 
      assisting Green Automotive with importing Electric Vehicles, to gaming 
      and hotel operations in Macau and North Africa, real estate development 
      in Mainland China, and international corporate finance in Europe. He has 
      served as a Director, Chairman, Chief Accounting Officer, President and 
      CEO of over 100 public and privately-held companies, and has represented 
      private and public businesses and owners from entity formation and 
      business structuring in Asia, Europe, the United States, Canada, and 
      North Africa in a variety of transactions, with extensive experience in 
      multi-national corporate mergers, acquisitions, corporate finance and 
      restructuring. He brings to the Company the strength of International 
      business and corporate governance needed at this time.”

Product Description▼▲
In this volume preacher Fred Craddock opens Luke's gospel to other preachers and teachers. Using Luke's own prologue as a guiding outline, Craddock pays special attention to the sequence of Luke's ''orderly account,'' particularly bringing out the continuities between Jesus and his heritage in Judaism and the church after him.

                Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching is a distinctive resource for those who interpret the Bible in the church. Planned and written specifically for teaching and preaching needs, this critically acclaimed biblical commentary is a major contribution to scholarship and ministry. It features individual commentaries by many of today's best-known scholars and practitioners, including Walter Brueggemann, Katharine Doob Sakenfeld, Fred B. Craddock, M. Eugene Boring, Thomas G. Long, Patrick D. Miller, Richard B. Hays, and William H. Willimon, among others. All volumes are available in hardcover by single title or set, or on CD-ROM. And now, WJK Press is pleased to announce the rollout of this popular series in paperback, with several titles slated for reissue each year.
                - Publisher
Using Luke's own prologue as the guideline for his commentary, Fred B. Craddock calls attention to the continuities between Jesus and his heritage in Judaism and the church after him. Like Luke, Craddock assumes the reader is not only a believer but also a leader in the community of faith.

Description

 Usin g Luke's own prologue as the guideline for his commentary, Fred B. Craddock calls attention to the continuities between Jesus and his heritage in Judaism and the church after him. Like Luke, Craddock assumes the reader is not only a believer but also a leader in the community of faith.Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching is a distinctive resource for those who interpret the Bible in the church. Planned and written specifically for teaching and preaching needs, this critically acclaimed biblical commentary is a major contribution to scholarship and ministry.This is the 2009 paperback edition. Originally published in hardback in the United States by Westminster John Knox Press in 1990.

Fred Luke Rejoins Management Team of Green Automotive Company as President and Secretary

		  Mr. Luke to fill vacancy created by resignation of Carter Read
		

Aug 21, 2015, 13:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Green Automotive Company 











 
















































 

 




















 


RIVERSIDE, Calif., Aug. 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Green Automotive Company (OTC:GACR) announced today that Fred G. Luke has agreed to rejoin the Company as its President and Secretary.
Ben Rainwater, the Company's CEO, commenting on Fred Luke's return to management said, "Fred served as the Company's President during 2011-2013 and was the driving force behind the Company's initial restructuring, re-capitalization and taking it from a non-reporting 'shell' company to a fully reporting 'non-shell' company".
"During Fred's two year tenure", Ben Rainwater went on say, "the Company's Market Capitalization rose to approximately $490 Million.  He further successfully renegotiated the contract with the original Chinese maker of the All-Electric Sport Utility Vehicle and took it through the U.S. regulatory testing before determining that the electric car sector was becoming too competitive and shifted the Company's focus to All-Electric, CNG and conventional-fueled shuttle buses, and municipal and school bus conversions". 
Mr. Luke stated that "my original objective was to get the All-Electric Sport Utility Vehicle approved for consumer sales in the U.S., while restructuring the Company to qualify for listing on the OTC Markets' OTCQB Tier, which I accomplished in December of 2012.  However, the All-Electric SUV did not pass the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards tests, forcing us to change direction and focus the Company's resources on the bus market, which at the time appeared to me to be wide-open". 
Following the decision to "change direction", the Company acquired Liberty Electric Cars Ltd, a U.K.-based company which represented to have successfully converted Range Rovers into All-Wheel Drive All-Electric vehicles. Mr. Luke also acquired a newly formed company, Newport Coachworks Inc., and hired Mr. Carter Read to begin building and converting buses, starting with shuttle buses. Shortly after the acquisition of Newport Coachworks Inc., Mr. Luke resigned from management but remained as a member of the Board of Directors.
"Recent events", said CEO Ben Rainwater, "including a dispute with the landlord of Newport Coachwork's Wilson Street manufacturing facility resulting in Newport Coachworks allegedly receiving a Notice to Quit or Pay and then being locked out of the facility, together with the recent resignation of Mr. Carter Read from his positions with Green Automotive Company and Newport Coachworks, have led the Company to turn back to Mr. Luke to assist with these issues and others facing the companies. Currently, we are attempting to determine from Mr. Read and the landlord at the Wilson Street facility exactly what has happened with Newport Coachworks and its assets and determine the exact nature of the relationship, if any, between those parties.  However, so far no litigation has been filed by any of the parties."  
"Fred has over 40 years in cleaning up problems like the ones Newport Coachworks is facing now", said Mr. Rainwater, "as he did in 2011, I expect him to get to the bottom of the problems with Newport Coachworks quickly,  take swift and appropriate action,  and begin to rebuild as he has done in the past. He has already  retained counsel to investigate the current status of the Wilson Street manufacturing facility and the circumstances and events leading up to Mr. Read's resignation, and the involvement; if any, of any other third party companies.
"As to the recent Message Board comments, and other rumors being circulated", said Mr. Luke, "I would recommend that everyone refrain from putting too much value in the Message Board 'reports' until my investigation of the activities and actions of Mr. Read and others has been completed, which I expect to conclude in the near future. We have already made contact with certain third parties that may be involved, as well as legal counsel for the Landlord, and we expect to  file our Form 8-K relating to Mr. Read's resignation and other management changes by today.  We will have further announcements as the requested documentation is produced and the facts come to light".
