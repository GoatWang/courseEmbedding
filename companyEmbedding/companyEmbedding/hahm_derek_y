We are home to three of the earliest pioneers in craft beer: Redhook Ale Brewery, Washington's largest craft brewery founded in 1981; Widmer Brothers Brewing, Oregon's largest craft brewery founded in 1984; and Kona Brewing Company, Hawaii's oldest and largest craft brewery founded in 1994. As part of Craft Brew Alliance, these craft brewing legends have expanded their reach across the U.S. and approximately 30 international markets. In addition to growing and nurturing distinctive brands rooted in local heritage, Craft Brew Alliance is committed to developing innovative new category leaders, such as Omission Beer, which is the #1 beer in the gluten-free beer segment, and Square Mile Cider, a tribute to the early American settlers who purchased the first plots of land in the Pacific Northwest.
