MLC NAND

Multilevel cell (MLC) is the most popular NAND Flash, providing the right combination of price and performance for a wide range of high-density applications.  Storing 2 bits per cell, MLC NAND is a popular solution for applications that need higher-density storage, such as SSDs, tablets, smart phones, and other wireless devices. MLC devices offer twice the capacity of SLC NAND in the same die area and are a good choice for cost efficiency.

About Micron


Micron In USA










DRAM
Whether your design requires high bandwidth, low power, high density, ultra-low latency, or high speed, we have the DRAM solution for you.





DRAM Modules
We build our memory modules from start to finish—beginning with the memory component design and stringently testing at every stage of development and manufacturing.





NAND Flash
Micron does more than design and manufacture NAND Flash memory. We strive to solve design challenges through better engineering—by raising the bar on features, function, and performance.





Managed NAND
By overcoming complex ECC and data-management challenges, our fully managed NAND devices ease technology transitions and integration while improving system performance and reliability.





Solid State Storage
Our family of solid state storage products targets a wide spectrum of needs—from low-density, cost-effective embedded storage, to client- and performance-class SSDs.





NOR Flash
Whether you’re designing for wireless, embedded, or automotive applications, our extensive portfolio of serial and parallel NOR Flash solutions delivers the right mixture of performance, cost, and design continuity, backed by years of Micron Flash memory expertise.





Hybrid Memory Cube
HMC’s abstracted interface and advanced reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) capabilities reduce complexity and deliver greater reliability—enabling your innovation and lowering your total cost of ownership like never before.





MCP
Our MCP product line offers a variety of devices, configurations, and package options, and we help you select the just-right combination of low power, high reliability, and overall robustness.

Right now, the market for computer memory products is positively booming. That demand, coupled with what appears to be continued discipline among the major players with respect to manufacturing capacity, has led to a surge in industrywide profits.One such major player, and clear beneficiary from this trend, is U.S.-based memory specialist, Micron (NASDAQ: MU). Micron saw its revenue pop 92% year-over-year last quarter, with gross profit margin surging from about 18% in the prior year to 48% in the most recent quarter.Image source: Micron.
The combination of much greater revenue and much higher margins ultimately led the company to enjoy non-GAAP net income of $1.9 billion for the quarter, translating to $1.62 of earnings per share.Management had a lot of interesting things to say on the conference call that accompanied these solid results. Here are three key items.Explaining the margin surgeOn the call, Micron CFO Ernie Maddock said that the company's strong gross profit margin performance year-over-year was driven by three major factors: "a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix, and lower cost-per-bit in both DRAM and NAND."In the coming quarter, Micron expects the good times to continue, with overall gross profit margin of between 47% and 51% and earnings per share of "between $1.73 and $1.87."Smartphone makers adding more RAMMicron reported that sales of DRAM for mobile devices "was in the mid-20% range" last quarter.One of the reasons that mobile seems to be growing quite nicely for Micron -- the company said that its mobile business raked in $1.1 billion in revenue and $304 million in operating income last quarter -- is that smartphone manufacturers continue to add more DRAM to their phones."When you look at the content of DRAMs in the mobile market, it really continues to increase nicely going in value smartphones from about a little over a gigabyte per phone to about doubling by the 2018 timeframe," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.It's not just about content growth in low-end smartphones, though.
"The same trend is clearly happening on the high-end phones, too, where you are starting to see 4- and 6-gigabyte DRAM content," the executive added."So, overall, when you look at the year-over-year trends in 2017, as well as when you look at the trajectory in 2018, mobile does continue to be a strong market," Mehrotra said.Success in "graphics and high-performance memory"
Mehrotra said on the call that the company continues "to build upon [Micron's] strong position in graphics and high-performance memory technology," highlighting its shipments of "12 gigabits per second GDDR5X, the industry's fastest discrete DRAM."The executive later said that the company's graphics memory business saw "double-digit revenue growth" last quarter "driven by strength in the game console market, as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5X-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)."Graphics memory is part of Micron's broader "specialty DRAM" portfolio, which the company said made up "mid-20%" of the company's overall DRAM business (itself 64% of its revenue last quarter).10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Right now, the market for computer memory products is positively booming. That demand, coupled with what appears to be continued discipline among the major players with respect to manufacturing capacity, has led to a surge in industrywide profits.One such major player, and clear beneficiary from this trend, is U.S.-based memory specialist, Micron (NASDAQ: MU). Micron saw its revenue pop 92% year-over-year last quarter, with gross profit margin surging from about 18% in the prior year to 48% in the most recent quarter.Image source: Micron.
The combination of much greater revenue and much higher margins ultimately led the company to enjoy non-GAAP net income of $1.9 billion for the quarter, translating to $1.62 of earnings per share.Management had a lot of interesting things to say on the conference call that accompanied these solid results. Here are three key items.Explaining the margin surgeOn the call, Micron CFO Ernie Maddock said that the company's strong gross profit margin performance year-over-year was driven by three major factors: "a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix, and lower cost-per-bit in both DRAM and NAND."In the coming quarter, Micron expects the good times to continue, with overall gross profit margin of between 47% and 51% and earnings per share of "between $1.73 and $1.87."Smartphone makers adding more RAMMicron reported that sales of DRAM for mobile devices "was in the mid-20% range" last quarter.One of the reasons that mobile seems to be growing quite nicely for Micron -- the company said that its mobile business raked in $1.1 billion in revenue and $304 million in operating income last quarter -- is that smartphone manufacturers continue to add more DRAM to their phones."When you look at the content of DRAMs in the mobile market, it really continues to increase nicely going in value smartphones from about a little over a gigabyte per phone to about doubling by the 2018 timeframe," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.It's not just about content growth in low-end smartphones, though.
"The same trend is clearly happening on the high-end phones, too, where you are starting to see 4- and 6-gigabyte DRAM content," the executive added."So, overall, when you look at the year-over-year trends in 2017, as well as when you look at the trajectory in 2018, mobile does continue to be a strong market," Mehrotra said.Success in "graphics and high-performance memory"
Mehrotra said on the call that the company continues "to build upon [Micron's] strong position in graphics and high-performance memory technology," highlighting its shipments of "12 gigabits per second GDDR5X, the industry's fastest discrete DRAM."The executive later said that the company's graphics memory business saw "double-digit revenue growth" last quarter "driven by strength in the game console market, as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5X-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)."Graphics memory is part of Micron's broader "specialty DRAM" portfolio, which the company said made up "mid-20%" of the company's overall DRAM business (itself 64% of its revenue last quarter).10 stocks we like better than Micron TechnologyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Micron Technology Inc. in 3 Charts
The chipmaker’s recent success matters to investors, but it's critical to understand the bigger picture context of its cyclical business.











                Andrew Tonner
            

                (TMFTheDude)



            
            Jul 21, 2017 at 10:18AM
            
            





Even as the Nasdaq Composite is reaching fresh all-time highs, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock's 138% rally over the past 12 months puts the Nasdaq's 25% rise to shame.  These numbers certainly don't lie, but they also only tell part of the story when it comes to Micron.
Take a step further back to view the bigger picture, and one sees a company that has experienced both sweeping successes and stinging failures over the years, a point investors enamored by its recent rally must keep in mind. To get a better sense of the company and the forces that drive it, let's examine three charts that sum up Micron Technology and its long-term share price dynamics.

Image Source: Micron Technology 

Micron Technology's sales
Perhaps the most important thing to understand when looking at Micron is that the DRAM and flash memory chips it sells are effectively commodity products. Market spot prices control what they can charge, which means that Micron's revenue is almost entirely dependent on the current supply-and-demand dynamic for both types of memory chips.
This can lead to the same sort of tremendous top-line fluctuations that are experienced by oil producers or other commodity-based businesses, as you can see from Micron's historical revenue chart.

MU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
As you can see, the general direction of Micron's sales has been upward, as technology and computing power have become more integral parts of our everyday lives in recent years.
However, since the year 2000, the company's revenue has experienced four major contractions that, predictably, led to steep losses for Micron shareholders (more on that below). Before turning to its stock price though, we need to look at the rest of Micron's cost structure, which plays an important role in a broader discussion of the giant chipmaker.
Micron Technology's gross and net margins
As is the case for most companies that lack pricing power, Micron Technology's margin structure shows a tremendous amount of variability. When times are good, the company can produce significant profits. However, when memory chip prices soften -- either due to economic weakness or market-wide supply-and-demand imbalances -- its profits can nosedive deep into the red as the following charts demonstrate.

MU Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
It's also important to note that Micron's cost structure differs from that of chipmakers like Qualcomm in that it owns and operates its own semiconductor manufacturing plants . This means Micron's cost structure is more rigid than that of firms that outsource their chip fabrication.
The added fixed costs that come with this strategy make Micron's bottom line more sensitive to revenue changes. Big picture, it's important to note that Micron's lack of pricing power (gross margins) and its more rigid cost structure (net margins) go a long way toward explaining the company's highly cyclical stock price.





Micron Technology's Stock Price
Because of the above factors, it should come as no surprise that Micron's stock has also swung wildly over the years. Take a look at the company's historical performance against its benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite.

MU data by YCharts
This nicely captures my cautious take on Micron, particularly for long-term buy-and-hold investors. Micron can generate market-beating returns when investors buy its shares during a pricing rut and hold them until memory prices recover, which is exactly the scenario that has played out with Micron over the past year or so.
Unfortunately, shareholders who have mistimed their investments -- we don't believe in trying to time the market here at The Fool -- have lost their shirts. To be sure, times are flush at Micron right now, and the continued recovery in its business has Wall Street analysts as bullish as ever.  However, the company's highly cyclical nature and lack of meaningful pricing power suggest this same scenario will eventually take place.
Ultimately, this isn't an attempt to dissuade investors from buying Micron stock. Rather, it's an earnest warning that owning Micron shares comes with legitimate risks that need to be fully understood prior to investing.

History[edit]
1978–1999[edit]
Micron was founded in Boise, Idaho, in 1978[6] by Ward Parkinson, Joe Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman as a semiconductor design consulting company.[7] Startup funding was provided by local Idaho businessmen Tom Nicholson, Allen Noble, Rudolph Nelson, and Ron Yanke. Later it received funding from Idaho billionaire J. R. Simplot, whose fortune was made in the potato business. In 1981, the company moved from consulting to manufacturing with the completion of its first wafer fabrication unit ("Fab 1"), producing 64K DRAM chips.
In 1994, founder Joe Parkinson retired as CEO and Steve Appleton took over as Chairman, President, and CEO.[6]
A 1996 3-way merger among ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services (MCMS) increased the size and scope of the company;[6] this was followed rapidly with the 1997 acquisition of NetFrame Systems, in a bid to enter the mid-range server industry.[8]
2000–present[edit]
Micron and Intel created a joint venture in 2005, based in IM Flash Technologies in Lehi, Utah.[9] This proved so successful that the two companies formed another joint venture in 2011, IM Flash Singapore, in Singapore.[10] In 2012, Micron became sole owner of this second joint venture.[11]
The company again changed leadership in June 2007 with COO Mark Durcan becoming President.
In 2008, Micron spun off Aptina Imaging, which is currently a privately-held company. Micron retained a stake in the spinoff.[12] However, the core company suffered setbacks requiring layoffs of 15 percent of its workforce in October 2008, during which period the company also announced the purchase of Qimonda's stake in Inotera technologies for $400 million. 2009 saw this trend of layoffs and acquisitions continue with the termination of an additional 2,000 employees and the acquisition of the FLCOS microdisplay company Displaytech. With the company's increasing fortunes, Micron was able to acquire agreed to buy flash-chip maker Numonyx for issuance of $1.27 billion in stock.
On February 3, 2012, the CEO, Steve Appleton, died in a small Lancair plane crash in Boise, Idaho.[13][14][15] Mark Durcan replaced Appleton as the CEO shortly thereafter,[16] eliminating his former title of President.[17]
In the 2012-2014 period, Micron again went through an acquisition-layoff cycle, becoming the majority shareholder of Inotera Memories, purchasing Elpida Memory and Powerchip.,[18] while announcing plans to layoff approximately 3,000 workers.[19]
In 2015, Micron and Intel embarked on another joint venture, 3D XPoint non-volatile memory.[20] Micron also acquired Tidal Systems.[21]
In December 2016, Micron finished acquiring the remaining 67% of Inotera’s stake and made Inotera a 100% subsidiary of Micron in Taiwan.[22]
In April 2017, Micron announced Sanjay Mehrotra as the new President and CEO to replace Mark Durcan.[23][24]
Products[edit]
Micron makes DRAM Memory components and modules, including SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM, LPDRAM, RLDRAM, PSRAM, and multi-chip packages. It also makes NAND, Managed NAND and NOR flash memory, and SSDs. Lexar and Crucial are some of the most popular brands the company uses to distribute its products.
In late 2009, the company was the first to announce a solid-state drive (SSD) using a 6 Gbit/s SATA interface.[25]

History[edit]
1978–1999[edit]
Micron was founded in Boise, Idaho, in 1978[6] by Ward Parkinson, Joe Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman as a semiconductor design consulting company.[7] Startup funding was provided by local Idaho businessmen Tom Nicholson, Allen Noble, Rudolph Nelson, and Ron Yanke. Later it received funding from Idaho billionaire J. R. Simplot, whose fortune was made in the potato business. In 1981, the company moved from consulting to manufacturing with the completion of its first wafer fabrication unit ("Fab 1"), producing 64K DRAM chips.
In 1994, founder Joe Parkinson retired as CEO and Steve Appleton took over as Chairman, President, and CEO.[6]
A 1996 3-way merger among ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services (MCMS) increased the size and scope of the company;[6] this was followed rapidly with the 1997 acquisition of NetFrame Systems, in a bid to enter the mid-range server industry.[8]
2000–present[edit]
Micron and Intel created a joint venture in 2005, based in IM Flash Technologies in Lehi, Utah.[9] This proved so successful that the two companies formed another joint venture in 2011, IM Flash Singapore, in Singapore.[10] In 2012, Micron became sole owner of this second joint venture.[11]
The company again changed leadership in June 2007 with COO Mark Durcan becoming President.
In 2008, Micron spun off Aptina Imaging, which is currently a privately-held company. Micron retained a stake in the spinoff.[12] However, the core company suffered setbacks requiring layoffs of 15 percent of its workforce in October 2008, during which period the company also announced the purchase of Qimonda's stake in Inotera technologies for $400 million. 2009 saw this trend of layoffs and acquisitions continue with the termination of an additional 2,000 employees and the acquisition of the FLCOS microdisplay company Displaytech. With the company's increasing fortunes, Micron was able to acquire agreed to buy flash-chip maker Numonyx for issuance of $1.27 billion in stock.
On February 3, 2012, the CEO, Steve Appleton, died in a small Lancair plane crash in Boise, Idaho.[13][14][15] Mark Durcan replaced Appleton as the CEO shortly thereafter,[16] eliminating his former title of President.[17]
In the 2012-2014 period, Micron again went through an acquisition-layoff cycle, becoming the majority shareholder of Inotera Memories, purchasing Elpida Memory and Powerchip.,[18] while announcing plans to layoff approximately 3,000 workers.[19]
In 2015, Micron and Intel embarked on another joint venture, 3D XPoint non-volatile memory.[20] Micron also acquired Tidal Systems.[21]
In December 2016, Micron finished acquiring the remaining 67% of Inotera’s stake and made Inotera a 100% subsidiary of Micron in Taiwan.[22]
In April 2017, Micron announced Sanjay Mehrotra as the new President and CEO to replace Mark Durcan.[23][24]
Products[edit]
Micron makes DRAM Memory components and modules, including SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM, LPDRAM, RLDRAM, PSRAM, and multi-chip packages. It also makes NAND, Managed NAND and NOR flash memory, and SSDs. Lexar and Crucial are some of the most popular brands the company uses to distribute its products.
In late 2009, the company was the first to announce a solid-state drive (SSD) using a 6 Gbit/s SATA interface.[25]

History[edit]
1978–1999[edit]
Micron was founded in Boise, Idaho, in 1978[6] by Ward Parkinson, Joe Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman as a semiconductor design consulting company.[7] Startup funding was provided by local Idaho businessmen Tom Nicholson, Allen Noble, Rudolph Nelson, and Ron Yanke. Later it received funding from Idaho billionaire J. R. Simplot, whose fortune was made in the potato business. In 1981, the company moved from consulting to manufacturing with the completion of its first wafer fabrication unit ("Fab 1"), producing 64K DRAM chips.
In 1994, founder Joe Parkinson retired as CEO and Steve Appleton took over as Chairman, President, and CEO.[6]
A 1996 3-way merger among ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services (MCMS) increased the size and scope of the company;[6] this was followed rapidly with the 1997 acquisition of NetFrame Systems, in a bid to enter the mid-range server industry.[8]
2000–present[edit]
Micron and Intel created a joint venture in 2005, based in IM Flash Technologies in Lehi, Utah.[9] This proved so successful that the two companies formed another joint venture in 2011, IM Flash Singapore, in Singapore.[10] In 2012, Micron became sole owner of this second joint venture.[11]
The company again changed leadership in June 2007 with COO Mark Durcan becoming President.
In 2008, Micron spun off Aptina Imaging, which is currently a privately-held company. Micron retained a stake in the spinoff.[12] However, the core company suffered setbacks requiring layoffs of 15 percent of its workforce in October 2008, during which period the company also announced the purchase of Qimonda's stake in Inotera technologies for $400 million. 2009 saw this trend of layoffs and acquisitions continue with the termination of an additional 2,000 employees and the acquisition of the FLCOS microdisplay company Displaytech. With the company's increasing fortunes, Micron was able to acquire agreed to buy flash-chip maker Numonyx for issuance of $1.27 billion in stock.
On February 3, 2012, the CEO, Steve Appleton, died in a small Lancair plane crash in Boise, Idaho.[13][14][15] Mark Durcan replaced Appleton as the CEO shortly thereafter,[16] eliminating his former title of President.[17]
In the 2012-2014 period, Micron again went through an acquisition-layoff cycle, becoming the majority shareholder of Inotera Memories, purchasing Elpida Memory and Powerchip.,[18] while announcing plans to layoff approximately 3,000 workers.[19]
In 2015, Micron and Intel embarked on another joint venture, 3D XPoint non-volatile memory.[20] Micron also acquired Tidal Systems.[21]
In December 2016, Micron finished acquiring the remaining 67% of Inotera’s stake and made Inotera a 100% subsidiary of Micron in Taiwan.[22]
In April 2017, Micron announced Sanjay Mehrotra as the new President and CEO to replace Mark Durcan.[23][24]
Products[edit]
Micron makes DRAM Memory components and modules, including SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM, LPDRAM, RLDRAM, PSRAM, and multi-chip packages. It also makes NAND, Managed NAND and NOR flash memory, and SSDs. Lexar and Crucial are some of the most popular brands the company uses to distribute its products.
In late 2009, the company was the first to announce a solid-state drive (SSD) using a 6 Gbit/s SATA interface.[25]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
