ST. LOUIS, June 9, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust (HIT) announced today that it is providing $46 million in financing for two multifamily developments in the greater St. Louis area. Cardinal Ritter Senior Services' St. John Neumann Apartments in Jennings, Missouri, and The Heights at Manhasset Apartments in Richmond Heights, Missouri, will provide 381 units of multifamily housing.
The HIT's investment of $5.1 million in the $8 million St. John Neumann project in St. Louis County, the most populous county in Missouri, will help Cardinal Ritter Senior Services to convert the building from a Section 202 project with a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract, to a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) development that will enhance the marketability and livability of the building.  Built in 1991, St. John Neumann Apartments has 100 units of affordable housing, with all units designated for persons 62 or older, earning at or below 50% of the area median income. The HIT is helping finance new construction of an additional 11 units, substantial rehabilitation of existing units, and refinance the existing Section 202 debt.  
In Richmond Heights, also in St. Louis County, construction is set to begin on the new $54 million Heights at Manhasset development. The HIT is investing $42 million of the project's financing. The new building will include 281 market-rate housing units and is located at the center of one of the most job rich areas in the region, with excellent access to the larger region via close proximity to two interstate highways. The project will be the first of four development phases.
"The HIT is excited to provide financing to these projects that will offer affordable housing options to a community that has had limited new construction since 2005," said HIT Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Stephanie H. Wiggins. 
All on-site construction work at the two properties will be performed using 100% union labor in coordination with the local building and construction trades unions. 
Jeff Aboussie, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the St. Louis Building and Construction Trades Council, said, "the union community welcomes the HIT's investments in St. Louis County. We know that with the HIT's involvement all the construction work will be done union. That means more family-supporting union jobs for our members and more high quality union-built development for the community."  
Under its Construction Jobs Initiative that began in early 2009, the HIT has invested $227 million to support eight projects in the St. Louis metro area, which represents more than 2,860 jobs for members of the local building and construction trades unions. Besides providing a major boost to the local economy, these projects also financed 1,648 new or rehabilitated housing units for local residents. In addition to St. John Neumann Apartments and The Heights at Manhasset, other St. Louis-area projects financed through this initiative are:

Holy Infant & St. Joseph Apartments, Cardinal Ritter Senior Services' properties in Shrewsbury, St. Louis County: A $13 million rehabilitation project offering 157 housing units affordable for low-income seniors. The HIT provided $6.6 million in financing. The project generated approximately 90 union construction jobs. 
Park Pacific Apartments, St. Louis:  A $98 million redevelopment offering 230 housing units.  The HIT provided $63 million in financing. The project created an estimated 755 union construction jobs. 
The Laurel, St. Louis: A $175 million redevelopment offering 205 housing units. The HIT provided $45 million in financing. The project generated approximately 1,340 union construction jobs. 
Villas at Crystal Lake, Swansea, IL:  A $26 million development offering 216 housing units. The HIT provided $24 million in financing. The project created an estimated 140 union construction jobs. 
The HIT has an active track record of financing projects in the St. Louis area. In its 30-year history, the HIT has invested approximately $549 million in 28 St. Louis area projects with total development costs of over $900 million. These projects represent 4,736 housing units and more than 6,380 union construction jobs. 
About the HIT

The investment objective of the HIT is to provide competitive returns for its investors and to promote the collateral objectives of constructing affordable housing and generating employment for union members in the construction trades and related industries.

Singh Cases posted with a "30000" identifier, i.e., 2013 NY Slip Op 30001(U), are republished from various state and local government websites. These include the New York State Unified Court System's E-Courts Service, and the Bronx County Clerk's office. This opinion is uncorrected and not selected for official publication. [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 1] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 45 -----------------------------------------------------------------)( JOSH REAVES, Derivatively on Behalf of RESOURCE CAPITAL CORP., DECISION AND ORDER Plaintiff, -against- Index No. 654485/2015 STEVEN KESSLER, EDWARD E.

SINGH, J.: Plaintiffs move for an order consolidating four actions pursuant to CPLR 602 and appointing lead counsel in the consolidated action. 1 Defendants cross-move to stay the actions pursuant to CPLR 2201 based on the pendency of an action in federal court. Four related shareholder derivative actions are pending in this c_ourt: 1) Reaves v.

Bryant. et al., Index No. 651187/2017 (filed March 7, 2017) (collectively, - the "related state derivative actions"). On September 9, 2015, a federal "stock drop". securities class action was filed in the Southern District of New York for violations of federal securities laws (Levin v. Resource Capital Corp., No. 1:15-cv-07081-LLS (S.D.N.Y.) (the "Levin class action")). At least nine "tag-along" shareholder derivative compiaints have followed: five filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District ofNew York (the "federal derivative lawsuits"), and the four related state derivative actions filed in this Court. The first federal derivative action was filed in 201 7 (NYSCEF Doc. No. 4 7, p. 9). On October 5, 2016, U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton denied a motion to dismiss the Levin class action. Factual Allegations This is a set of shareholder derivative actions commenced by shareholders on behalf of nominal defendant Resource Capital Corp. ("Resource Capital" or the "company"), against certain officers and directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, and against related parties Resource Capital Manager, Inc. ("Resource ·Manager") and Page 2 of 15 3 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 3] I I NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 Resource America, Inc. ("Resource America") for unjust enrichment. Resource Capital is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that is externally managed by Resource Manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, an asset management company. Neither the company nor Resource Manager has any exclusively dedicated employees. Rather, all of Resource Capital's and Resource Manager's officers, portfolio managers, administrative personnel, and other employees are employees of Resource America. Until September 8, 2016, defendants Edward Cohen and Jonathan Cohen (collectively, the "Cohens") were Resource America's largest stockholders, beneficially owning approximately 30% of its shares. Although the Cohens are now retired from Resource Capital's board of directors, they still allegedly control the company through their appointment of the current board members, who are all allegedly loyal to and dependent upon them. Plaintiffs contend that Resource America and Resource Manager (which are both allegedly dominated by the Cohens) have significant discretion as to the implementation ofResource Capital's operating policies and investment strategies. The actions allege that the Cohens and certain other defendants engaged in a course of conduct designed to enrich Resource America at Resource Capital's expense, through excessive and undeserved management fees. First, the board agreed to pay Page 3 of 15 I 4 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 4] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 Resource Manager a monthly base management fee equal to one-twelfth of the company's equity, regardless of performance. Second, the board conceal~d for years that one of the company's mezzanine loan positions, which it acquired in 2007 (the "mezzanine loan"), was largely supported by a portfolio ofluxury brand hotel's located in or near Puerto Rico. Third, the board repeatedly caused or allo'wed the company to improperly brag that all of the companfs commercial real estate loans. were performing for years during the collapse ofthe Puerto Rican economy, continuing long after the mezzanine loan stopped performing in 2012. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants' wrongful course of conduct improperly inflated the company's apparent equity from late 2012 through the first half of 20 i 5, in turn improperly inflating the ( management fees the company pa~d to Resource Manager during that time to an average of approximately $13. 7 million per year. On August 4, 2015, after tJ:ie stock market closed, Resource Capital issued a . f press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Following numerous alleged improper statements concerning the company's financial condition and loan portfolio, Resourc~ Capital disclosed that it would incur a quarterly net loss of $31 million due primarily to a $41.1 million loan loss on the mezzanine loan. As disclosed in the press release, major. disruptions in Puerto Rico's economy caused the company to determine that the mezzanine loan should have been fully Page 4 of 15 5 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 5] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 reserved. As a consequence of this disclosure, Resource Capital's stock fell 14.66%, eradicating over $68.4 million in market capitalization. Had the company timely recorded the loss in late 2012, when the mezzanine loan stopped performing, a similar decline in equity would presumably have occurred then, causing Resource Capital to pay far less in management fees from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2015. Plaintiffs allege that Resource Capital's directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by: 1) misrepresenting, and causing the company to misrepresent to the investing public, the risk of the con:ipany's commercial loans portfolio, its process and controls for assessing the quality and value of that portfolio; 2) by failing to maintain for the company adequate internal and financial controls; 3) by failing to disclose, and causing the company to fail to disclose to the investing public, that the company lacked adequate internal and financial controls; and 4) causing the company to pay excessive management fees. The complaints assert causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. Cross-Motion to Stay the Actions Pursuant to CPLR 2201 CPLR 2201 provides that "the court in which an action is pending may grant a stay of proceedings in a proper case, upon such terms as may be just." The decision Page 5 of 15 6 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 6] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 is discretionary (Britt v. International Bus Services, Inc., 255 A.D.2d 143 [1st Dept., 1998]). A stay should be granted pending determination of a related proceeding when the other proceeding shares complete idt'.ntity of parties, claims and relief sought (see Asher v. Abbott Labs., 307 A.D.2d 211, 211(l5tDept.,2003)). A court has broad discretion to issue a stay particularly where the stay would "avoid the risk of inconsistent adjudications, application of proof, and potential waste . . ofjudicial resources" (In re Tenenbaum, 81 A.D.3d 738, 739 (2d Dept., 2011 ); see also One Beacon Am. Ins. Co. v. Colgate-Pal~olive Co., 96 A.D.3d 541, 541 (1st Dept., . . ' ' 2012) ("The duplication of effort, waste of judiCial resources, and possibility of inconsistent rulings in the absence of a stay outweigh .any prejudice to plaintiff resulting from the [stay]")). A stay is appropriate even where there_ is not complete identity of parties and claims where there is a common question of law and fact (Uptown Healthcare Mgt.. Inc. v. Rivkin Radler LLP, 116 A.D.3d 631 (l5t Dept., 2014); Belopolsky v. Renew Data Corp., ·41 A.D.3d 322 (1st Dept., 2007)). Under appropriate circumstances, including the existence of an identity of issues and parties, an action in state. court ,may be stayed where there is another aCtion pending in federal court (Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London v. Pneumo Abex Corp., 36 A.D.3d 441 [1st Dept., 2007]). 'In such a situation, the issuance of a stay is not a matter of right; rather, it is a matter qf comity, orderly procedure and judicial Page 6 of 15. 7 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 7] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 discretion (General Aniline & Film Corp. v. Bayer Co., 305 N.Y. 479 [1953]). - Additionally, a stay may be. granted, even though defendants have not yet interposed answers (see Britt, 255 A.D.2d at 143). Finally, in determining whether to issue a stay, a court may consider multiple additional factors.2 Plaintiffs' first contention is that they will be unduly prejudiced if the Court grants a stay. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the federal lawsuits are weaker than the complaint filed in the Reaves action because at the time the federal derivative lawsuits were filed, two of the most culpable defendants, Edward Cohen and Jonathan . I Cohen, were already off the Resource Capital board. Emphasizing that demand futility is assessed as to the directors on the board when the action is filed, the Reaves action was the only action that placed real litigation pressure on defendants - and the only . action capable of doing so - by alleging demand futility upon a board that included the most culpable defendants on the board, the Cohens. Accordingly, as the Reaves action is the action least susceptible to dismissal of all the derivative actions, defendants moved to stay the Reaves action in favor of the substantively weaker federal derivative 2 These factors include whether it is in the state or in the federal forum that a more complete disposition of issues may be obtained; whether it is the federal or the state court that possesses a greater familiarity with the trial of such issues; whether the federal action was commenced first and discovery has been completed; whether the defendants in the actions are the same; whether there is substantial overlap between the issues raised in the two proceedings; whether a stay will avoid duplication of effort and waste of judicial resources; whether a stay will avoid the risk of inconsistent rulings; and whether plaintiffs have demonstrated how they would be prejudiced by a stay (Asher, 307 A.D.2d at 211-12). Page 7 of 15 8 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 8] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 lawsuits for the primary purpose of gaining an insurmountable tactical advantage over plaintiffs. There is no New York case law explicitly stating that this Court must compare the federal action to the state action on the merits to make a preliminary determination as to which party is more likely to prevail. The cases cited above do not list it as a factor to consider on an application for a stay. Therefore, this Court will not consider the merits of each action in making its determination. Plaintiffs' second contention is that the claims under section 14(a) of the federal Exchange Act in the federal derivative lawsuits are meritless and do not broaden the federal lawsuits. Specifically, plaintiffs assert that federal courts routinely dismiss "proxy fraud" claims under section 14(a) of the Exchange Act on the grounds "that stockholders may assert meritless 14(a) claims for the sole purpose of invoking federal jurisdiction" (Galefv. Alexander, 615 F.2d 51, 66 n.24 (2d Cir. 1980). Accordingly, plaintiffs contend that there is a strong inference that the federal derivative lawsuits tacked on meritless Section 14(a) claims to fabricate federal jurisdiction and do not broaden the federal derivative suits. Plaintiffs are engaging in hyperbole in asserting that the proxy fraud claims are "patently meritless." The genesis of plaintiffs' assertion is a footnote in Galef, supra. However, plaintiffs fail to quote the entire footnote, which states in its entirety: 9 of 16 Page 8 of 15 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 9] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 We recognize the possibility that stockholders may assert meritless s 14(a) claims for the sole purpose of invoking federal jurisdiction. But this risk should be lessened by Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, which requires that the pleading of a party represented by counsel be signed by· at least one attorney in his individual name, and which further provides: The signature of an attorney constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading;· th51t to the best of his knowledge, information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay .... For a wilful violation of this rule an attorney may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action. (Galef, 615 F.2d at 66, footnote 24). On this record, there is no reasonable basis for the Court to assume that the federal proxy fraud claims are. meritless and that th~ Section 14(a) claims do not broaden the federal suits. In addition to the claims asserted in the state cases, the federal shareholder ~erivative actions involve a proxy fraud claim under Section 14(a) of_the Exchange Act. The federal court has "exclusive jurisdiCtion" over·such claims (see 15 U.S.C. section 78aa). Accordingly, as the federal court is the only court that has jurisdiction over every claim asserted by the derivative plaintiffs, the federal court can provide a mqre complete disposition of the claims at issue (see Barron v. Bluhdorn, 68 A:D.2d 809, 810 [pt Dept., 1979]); Theatre Confections, Inc. v. Andrea !heaters, Inc., 126 A.D.2d 969, 970 [4th. Dept., 1987] (action stayed as federal court had exclusive jurisdiction over issue involving federal antitrustlaws); Chan v. Zoullas,34 Misc.3d Page 9 of 15 10 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 10] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 1210(A) [Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty., 2012], at *3:-4 (stay proper where "the decision in one action will determine all the questions in the other action or will, at least, reduce the issues in the other action[]"); El Greco, Inc. v. Cohn, 139 A.D.2d 615 [2d Dept., 1988] (staying action where the "record discloses that a more complete disposition of the parties' respective contentions can be obtained in the earlier-commenced federal action"). Plaintiffs' third contention is that the Reaves action was filed in this Court , before any of the federal derivative lawsuits; As this Court was1the first which has taken jurisdiction, New York's first-filed doctrine dictates that this court "is the one in which the matter should be determined and it is a violation of the rules of comity to interfere" (In re Perceptron, Inc. (Vogelsong), 34 A.D.3d 1215 [4th Dept., 2006]). Vogelsong involved a proceeding to vacate an arbitration award and to enjoin an action brought in Michigan to enforce the award. Accordingly, it is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter. However, the first-filed rule, which gives precedence to the court in which an action is first commenced should not be mechanically applied (ACE Fire Underwriters Ins. Co. v. ITT Industries, Inc., 44 A.D.3d 404, 405'(1 st Dept., 2007). Rather,_the court may look to factors outside of the first-filed rule in making its determination as to whether this court should grant a stay. See generally, In re NYSE Euronext Page 10 of 15 11 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 11] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 Shareholders/ICE Litigation, 39 Misc.3d 619, 625 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty., Mar. 1, 2013). As discussed, supra, the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, the federal courts can provide a more complete disposition of the claims at issue. This factual determination weighs heavily in favor of issuing a stay in this proceeding. Plaintiffs' fourth contention is that the determination of whether demand was futile as to a majority of the poard will necessarily require different analyses in the state and federal actions. At the ti~e the first derivative action was filed in state court, Resource Capital's board consisted of ten defendant directors: the Cohens, Kessler, Beach, Hart, Ickowicz, Levin, Neff, Fore, and Wiggins. However, at the time the first -, derivative action was filed in federal court, Resource Capital's board consisted of nine directors: Kessler, Levin, Neff, Beach, Hart, Ickowicz, Fore, Wiggins, and nondefendant directors Andrew L. Farkas and Jeffrey P. Cohen. As there is no case law stating this Court must weigh the relative merits of the federal action and the state action as a factor in determining whether to impose a stay, this c~urt will not deny a stay based upon the substantive merits of each action. Plaintiffs' final conte~tion is that a stay may not be granted until both the state derivative lawsuits and the federal derivative lawsuits are fully at issue. Plaintiffs assert that, until both actions are fully at "issue, it is impossible to say that a_Page 11of15 12 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 12] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 determination in one action will dispose of the other. The Court has the discretion to ,grant a stay even when issue is not joined (Kayser v. Horton, 42 A.D.2d 839 [4th Dept., 1973]). Ultimately, a majority of the factors weigh in favor of a stay. Because the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction over the Section 14(a) claims under the Exchange Act, the federal court will provide a more complete disposition of the claims. A stay avoids the risk of inconsistent rulings, duplication of effort, and waste of judicial resources. See One Beacon, 96 A.D.3d at 541. For the reasons discussed, supra, the Court is not convinced that plaintiffs will suffer undue prejudice as a result of a stay. The Reaves action was the first action filed, but the Court in its discretion fin~s that is not asufficient reason to deny the stay under the specific circumstances of this case. Plaintiffs' Motions to Consolidate Actions CPLR 602 provides that a party may move to consolidate "actions involving a common question of law or fact'' into a single action. As a general rule, New York courts favor consolidation as a matter of public policy (Geneva Temps, Inc. v. New World Communities, Inc., 24 A.D.3d 332 [!51 Dept., 2005] (noti~g that ~'there is a preference for consolidation in the interest of judicial economy where there are · common questions oflaw and fact.")). Consolidation reduces calendar delays, results in judicial economy, eliminates the problem of inconsist.ent results, avoids duplication 13 of 16 Page 12 of 15 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 13] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 '~f discovery,· and reduces legal expense and inconvenience to -witnesses (Am~an Holdings. Inc. v. Torys LLP, 32 A.D.3d 337 [!81 Dept., 2006] (emphasizing that consolidation was particularly appropriate wheri itwas "probable that injustice would result" from inconsistent outcomes in the two actions)). Although consolidated actions need not share every factual or legal· issue, there must be identity of issues (id.). . Here, it is undisputed that the actions allege ~irtually identical facts in support of substantially identical claims against nearly identical defendants. Defendants do not oppose consolidation. If the actions are consolidated, plaintiffs request that the consolidated case be assigned the master caption "In re Resource. Capital Corp. Shareholder Derivative J Litigation, Master Index No. 654485/2015." - - They conte~d that the request is consistent with the court's authority to manage its docket and would further pr~mote judicial economy and efficiency. Plaintiffs have made a. persuasive argument in favor of consolidation, so the . application to consolidate is granted. Motions to Appoint Lead Counsel The stay of this action will bring the litigation in this Court to a complete halt while the litigation proceeds in federal court. Because notl1ing can happen in this court from this point forward, it would serve no useful purpose for the Court to appoint lead ·Page 13 of 15 14 of 16 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/08/2017 10:39 AM 14] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 55 INDEX NO. 654485/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/08/2017 counsel at this stage. The issue is moot. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that defendants' cross-motion to stay the actions is granted to the extent of staying further proceedings in the actions, except for an application to vacate or modify the stay; and it is further ORDERED that the parties may make an application by order to show cause to vacate or modify this stay upon the fiD:al determination of the action pending in federal court; and it is further ORDERED that the motions to appoint lead counsel are denied as. moot; and it is further ~ ORDERED that the motion to consolidate is granted, and the above-captioned action is consolidated in this Court with Caito v.

Bryant. et al., Index No. 651187/2017, under Index No. 654485/2015, and the consolidated action shall be assigned the master caption In re Resource Capital Corp. Shareholder Derivative Litigation,.

Going beyond the basics, a Coker business degree teaches you what it really takes to be a leader.
With a strong liberal arts core, you will study business philosophy from a global and entrepreneurial perspective. You will learn how to communicate and write clearly, concisely, and completely. You will gain not just practical skills, but also the understanding of complex business practices and how to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.
But what good is the knowledge without the skills and confidence to apply it? With Coker’s round-table learning philosophy, you’ll work in small groups that encourage you to explore and practice the process of complex decision-making in real-world business scenarios. Outside of the classroom, you’ll find numerous opportunities to practice the practical application of your skills. Consider pursuing an internship with Duke Energy or Sonoco Products Company (two of the major international companies in Hartsville), learning about global markets with an internship abroad, or getting involved with Enactus, an active campus group and nonprofit that aims to enable progress through entrepreneurial action.

The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust recently announced that, after working closely with PNC Real Estate and Developers Mortgage Corporation, it has provided $32 million of pension capital funding toward the major rehabilitation of Chicago’s 2101 South Michigan Apartments. 
The 26-story residential tower, located on Chicago’s Near South Side, was built in 1971 with financial help from the Federal Housing Administration’s grant program for affordable housing. Currently the property is in need of major upgrades that will ultimately help the 250-unit building become more energy efficient. The $42 million renovation project includes a new lobby, community room, on-site laundry facility and energy-efficient appliances, as well as new heating and cooling in the individual units. The rehabilitation work is expected to generate around 245 union construction jobs.
“As older downtown neighborhoods experience growth with the corresponding demand for housing, it’s very important to preserve and update existing units whenever possible,” said HIT Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Stephanie H. Wiggins. “The HIT’s investment in 2101 South Michigan will help ensure that quality housing near Chicago’s downtown Loop, with its employment opportunities and other amenities, remains available to individuals and families at all income levels.”
Located in Chicago’s South Loop neighborhood, the 2101 South Michigan property is in an area that is experiencing a growing demand for residential units and neighborhood amenities. Of the building’s units, 90 are subsidized through a Housing Assistance Payment contract which is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Out of those units, 39 are restricted to residents age 62 and older. Those units will stay affordable through a long-term HAP contract which extends the affordability component of the property for another 20 years.
“HIT’s union pension investments have helped address the housing and economic development needs of working families in the Chicago area,” said Lesyllee White, HIT’s senior vice president and managing director of marketing. “The HIT has financed the production of housing for low- and moderate-income families, while also generating union construction jobs. This is having a significant impact on working families. HIT is actively targeting Chicago to fund more income- and job-generating investments in 2013.”
