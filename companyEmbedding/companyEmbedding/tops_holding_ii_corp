Tops Holding II Corporation Reports Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended April 22, 2017; Provides Capital Expenditure Guidance for Fiscal 2017
Jun 6 17
Tops Holding II Corporation reported unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended April 22, 2017. For the quarter, net loss was $22.8 million compared with $15.2 million during the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2017 EBITDA was $26.4 million compared with $33.9 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes specified non-cash and items that are not indicative of core operating performance, was $30.9 million, down $6.3 million from $37.12 million for the 2016 first quarter. Cash used in operating activities during the first quarter was $0.4 million compared with $10.4 million of cash provided by operating activities during the prior-year period. The change was primarily due to a larger net loss, adjusted for non-cash income and expense, of $7.1 million, and working capital changes, inclusive of a reduction of accrued expenses that included an $11.5 million reduction in accrued third-party gift card obligations. This negative cash flow impact was $6.1 million higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable 2016 quarter due to the special gift card promotional program that was run in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures were $8.5 million in the first quarter and were largely related to store remodels and maintenance activities. Net sales were $740,828,000 against $713,736,000 for the same period of last year. Operating income was $2,981,000 against $10,308,000 for the same period of last year. Loss before income taxes was $22,167,000 against $14,579,000 for the same period of last year. EBITDA was $26,390,000 against $33,922,000 for the same period of last year.

The company expects to invest $20 to $25 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2017.

Tops Holding LLC & Tops Markets II Corp. Announce Early Results of Exchange Offer & Consent Solicitation & Extension of Deadl...

      Tops Holding LLC and Tops Markets II Corporation (the “Issuers”) today 
      announced the early tender results for their previously announced 
      exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to certain eligible noteholders 
      described below to exchange any and all of the outstanding $85,514,000 
      aggregate principal amount of 8.750%/9.500% Senior Notes due 2018 (CUSIP 
      / ISIN Nos 89078XAB3 / US89078XAB38) (the “HoldCo Notes”) issued by Tops 
      Holding II Corporation for a combination of new 9.000% Senior Amortizing 
      Notes due 2021 (the “OpCo Notes”) and cash consideration.
    

      According to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the exchange 
      agent and information agent for the Exchange Offer, as of 5:00 p.m., New 
      York City time, on July 21, 2017 (the “Early Deadline”), the Issuers had 
      received tenders and consents from holders of $76,426,000 in aggregate 
      principal amount of the HoldCo Notes, representing approximately 89.37% 
      of the total outstanding principal amount of the HoldCo Notes.
    

      Accordingly, the Issuers have received consents sufficient to approve 
      the proposed amendments to the indenture governing the HoldCo Notes (the 
      “Consent Solicitation”), and Tops Holding II Corporation and the trustee 
      for the HoldCo Notes will enter into a supplemental indenture containing 
      such amendments. Such amendments will not become effective and 
      operative, with respect to any HoldCo Notes that remain outstanding 
      following the settlement of the Exchange Offer, unless and until the 
      Issuers accept for exchange the HoldCo Notes validly tendered in the 
      Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation.
    

      As the condition that Eligible Holders representing at least 90% of the 
      aggregate principal amount of HoldCo Notes tender their HoldCo Notes in 
      the Exchange Offer has not been met, the Issuers also announced that 
      they have extended the date by which tenders must be received for 
      holders to receive the “Total Exchange Consideration” of $883.50 in 
      principal amount of OpCo Notes and $116.50 in cash consideration per 
      $1,000 principal amount of HoldCo Notes to 11:59 p.m., New York City 
      time, on August 4, 2017, which date and time is the “Expiration Date” 
      for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. Accordingly, all HoldCo 
      Notes tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date, including those 
      tendered at or prior to the Early Deadline, will be eligible to receive 
      the Total Exchange Consideration, plus accrued and unpaid interest in 
      cash on HoldCo Notes accepted for exchange through, but not including, 
      the settlement date for the Exchange Offer. All other terms and 
      conditions of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation remain 
      unchanged. The Withdrawal Deadline and Early Deadline have expired. 
      HoldCo Notes tendered for exchange may not be validly withdrawn and 
      consents may not be revoked, unless the Issuers determine in the future 
      in their sole discretion to permit withdrawal and revocation rights.
    

Available Documents and Other Details


      Documents relating to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation will 
      only be distributed to holders of HoldCo Notes who complete and return 
      an eligibility form confirming that they are either a “qualified 
      institutional buyer” under Rule 144A or not a “U.S. person” under 
      Regulation S for purposes of applicable securities laws (“Eligible 
      Holders”). Holders of HoldCo Notes who desire to complete an eligibility 
      form should either visit the website for this purpose at http://www.dfking.com/tops 
      or request instructions by sending an e-mail to tops@dfking.com 
      or calling D.F. King & Co., Inc., the information agent for the Exchange 
      Offer and Consent Solicitation, at (877) 478-5040 (U.S. Toll-free) or 
      (212) 269-5550 (Collect).
    

      The Opco Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities 
      Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any other applicable 
      securities laws and, unless so registered, the Opco Notes may not be 
      offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States 
      or to or for the account of any U.S. person, except pursuant to an 
      exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the 
      Opco Notes are being offered and issued only (i) to “qualified 
      institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) 
      and (ii) outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” 
      in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
    

      The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in 
      the informational documents relating to the Exchange Offer. The offering 
      documents related to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation contain 
      important information and should be read carefully before any decision 
      is made with respect to the Exchange Offer. This press release is for 
      informational purposes only and is neither an offer to sell or purchase, 
      nor a solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase, the HoldCo Notes or 
      the OpCo Notes. The Exchange Offer is only being made pursuant to the 
      Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement and 
      the related letter of transmittal each dated July 10, 2017. The Exchange 
      Offer is not being made to holders of HoldCo Notes in any jurisdiction 
      in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance 
      with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction.
    

The information made available in this release includes 
      forward-looking statements, which are generally statements about future 
      events, plans, objectives and performance. Generally, the words 
      “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” 
      “will” and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward 
      looking statements reflect our current expectations, based on currently 
      available information, and are not guarantees. Although we 
      believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking 
      statements are reasonable, these expectations could prove inaccurate as 
      such statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
      beyond our ability to control or predict. Should one or more of 
      these risks or uncertainties, or other risks or uncertainties not 
      currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, 
      materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual 
      results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or 
      projected.

          Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of HoldCo Notes validly 
          tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for exchange by 
          the Issuers, subject to any rounding as described in the 
          Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement.
        







           
        



          (2)
        



          The Total Exchange Consideration (as defined below) will be paid in 
          a combination of (a) a principal amount of OpCo Notes, (b) $66.50 in 
          cash per $1,000 principal amount of HoldCo Notes and (c) an amount 
          of cash equal to the Early Tender Payment (as defined below)
        







           
        



          (3)
        



          Only Eligible Holders who validly tender (and do not validly 
          withdraw) their HoldCo Notes prior to the Early Deadline (as defined 
          below) will be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment. 
          Eligible Holders who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) 
          their HoldCo Notes after the Early Deadline but prior to the 
          Expiration Time (as defined below) will only be eligible to receive 
          the Exchange Consideration (as defined below), which does not 
          include the Early Tender Payment.
        



      Eligible Holders that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their 
      HoldCo Notes in the Exchange Offer prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City 
      time, on July 21, 2017 (the “Early Deadline”) will receive, per $1,000 
      principal amount of HoldCo Notes: (i) $883.50 in principal amount of 
      OpCo Notes and (ii) $116.50 in cash (which cash consideration includes 
      the “Early Tender Payment” of $50.00 in cash) (the “Total Exchange 
      Consideration”). For any HoldCo Notes validly tendered after the Early 
      Deadline, Eligible Holders will receive per $1,000 principal amount of 
      HoldCo Notes: (i) $883.50 in principal amount of OpCo Notes and (ii) 
      $66.50 in cash (the “Exchange Consideration”). Eligible Holders will 
      also receive accrued and unpaid interest in cash on the exchanged HoldCo 
      Notes through, but not including, the settlement date for the Exchange 
      Offer.
    

      The OpCo Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and 
      guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by each 
      of Tops Holding LLC’s current subsidiaries (other than Tops Markets II 
      Corporation and TM1, LLC) and certain of Tops Holding LLC’s future 
      domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the OpCo Notes will be guaranteed by 
      the Parent on a senior unsecured basis. The OpCo Notes will be subject 
      to mandatory sinking fund payments prior to the maturity date for the 
      OpCo Notes in the amounts of $13.0 million, $17.0 million and $20.0 
      million on September 15th of 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and will 
      mature on March 15, 2021.
    

      In conjunction with the Exchange Offer, the Issuers, on behalf of Tops 
      Holding II, are soliciting consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) to 
      eliminate several of the restrictive covenants and events of default in 
      the indenture governing the HoldCo Notes. Holders who validly tender 
      their HoldCo Notes in the Exchange Offer will be deemed to have 
      submitted consents pursuant to the Consent Solicitation. The Exchange 
      Offer is subject to conditions, including a requirement, unless waived 
      by the Issuers, that Eligible Holders representing at least 90% of the 
      aggregate principal amount of HoldCo Notes tender their HoldCo Notes in 
      the Exchange Offer.
    

      Prior to launching the Exchange Offer, an Eligible Holder of the HoldCo 
      Notes, which, together with certain of its affiliated funds, holds 
      approximately 84.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the HoldCo 
      Notes, has executed a support agreement with the Issuers pursuant to 
      which it has agreed to tender all of its HoldCo Notes (and deliver 
      corresponding consents) in the Exchange Offer.
    

      The Exchange Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on 
      August 4, 2017 (unless extended) (the “Expiration Date”). Tendered 
      HoldCo Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., 
      New York City time, on July 21, 2017, but not thereafter.
    

Available Documents and Other Details


      Documents relating to the Exchange Offer will only be distributed to 
      holders of HoldCo Notes who complete and return an eligibility form 
      confirming that they are either a “qualified institutional buyer” under 
      Rule 144A or not a “U.S. person” under Regulation S for purposes of 
      applicable securities laws (“Eligible Holders”). Holders of HoldCo Notes 
      who desire to complete an eligibility form should either visit the 
      website for this purpose at http://www.dfking.com/tops 
      or request instructions by sending an e-mail to tops@dfking.com

      The Opco Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities 
      Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any other applicable 
      securities laws and, unless so registered, the Opco Notes may not be 
      offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States 
      or to or for the account of any U.S. person, except pursuant to an 
      exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the 
      Opco Notes are being offered and issued only (i) in the United States to 
      “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the 
      Securities Act) and (ii) outside the United States, to persons other 
      than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities 
      Act.
    

      The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in 
      the informational documents relating to the Exchange Offer. The Offering 
      Documents contain important information and should be read carefully 
      before any decision is made with respect to the Exchange Offer. This 
      press release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer 
      to sell or purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase, 
      the HoldCo Notes or the OpCo Notes. The Exchange Offer is only being 
      made pursuant to the Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent 
      Solicitation Statement and the related letter of transmittal. The 
      Exchange Offer is not being made to holders of HoldCo Notes in any 
      jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in 
      compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such 
      jurisdiction.
    

The information made available in this release includes 
      forward-looking statements, which are generally statements about future 
      events, plans, objectives and performance. Generally, the words 
      “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” 
      “will” and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Forward 
      looking statements reflect our current expectations, based on currently 
      available information, and are not guarantees. Although we 
      believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking 
      statements are reasonable, these expectations could prove inaccurate as 
      such statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
      beyond our ability to control or predict. Should one or more of 
      these risks or uncertainties, or other risks or uncertainties not 
      currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, 
      materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual 
      results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or 
      projected.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tops Holding II Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results
WILLIAMSVILLE, NY, March 30, 2017 – Tops Holding II Corporation (“Tops” or the “Company”), the indirect parent of Tops Markets, LLC (“Tops Markets”), a leading supermarket retailer serving Upstate New York, Northern Pennsylvania, Western Vermont and North Central Massachusetts, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016 (“Fiscal 2016”).  The Fiscal 2016 period included 52 weeks, while the Fiscal 2015 period included 53 weeks.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2016 Performance 




 

•

Fourth quarter inside sales increased 5.4% when excluding the extra sales week in 2015




 

•

Full-year inside sales up 2.4% to $2.3 billion when excluding the extra sales week




 

•

Added nine supermarkets during the year; Total of 172 stores at year-end
“We continued to execute our core strategy by expanding our store base with nine new supermarkets, and, importantly, maintaining or growing market share in each of our key regions during the year,” commented Frank Curci, Tops Chairman and CEO.  “While 2016 was a tough environment as the industry struggled with persistent food price deflation, we continued to take a long-term view and implement the appropriate steps to make our operations more efficient and set the stage for stronger financial performance when the operating environment improves.”  
“As deflationary headwinds are expected to continue into the first half of 2017, our focus will be much of the same,” he said.  
“We will continue to diversify our product portfolio, especially in high-growth categories such as natural and organics, execute strategic initiatives in an effort to drive sales and customer loyalty, and look for additional operational efficiencies to manage our margin profile,” Curci said, “And, as we have demonstrated, we will continue to take an opportunistic approach to strategic acquisitions or new store development that can further strengthen our footprint.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tops Holding II Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results 




 

·

Generated $54.6 million of cash from operations in 2015; up 43% over prior year 




 

·

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 million to $30.4 million compared to the prior year




 

·

Added five supermarket locations in 2015  
WILLIAMSVILLE, NY, March 23, 2016 – Tops Holding II Corporation (“Tops” or the “Company”), the indirect parent of Tops Markets, LLC (“Tops Markets”), a leading supermarket retailer serving Upstate New York, Northern Pennsylvania and Vermont, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2016.
“We continued to make progress in 2015.  We added five new locations during the year, completed a number of significant and minor store remodels, upgraded our POS system, and importantly, ended the year with encouraging market share trends throughout our footprint.  We also greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as we completed our debt refinancing earlier in the year,” commented Frank Curci, Tops Chairman and CEO.  “The year was not without its challenges, with historically low inflation, the weak Canadian dollar, which significantly reduced the number of Canadian shoppers at stores in our Buffalo/Niagara market area, and unseasonably warm weather, which allowed for more mobility and eating out during the fourth quarter.  Despite those headwinds, we continued to execute our strategy as we generated significant cash to support our debt pay down and growth initiatives.”  
Mr. Curci added, “As we embark on 2016, we will continue to drive our strategy and our focus on debt reduction.  Despite some of the top line challenges we faced in 2015 continuing into 2016, fill-in acquisitions, continued growth from recent additions to our portfolio of supermarkets, and a number of merchandising and marketing initiatives are expected to drive overall growth.”    
Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Inside sales were $570.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (13-week period), up 7.3%, or $38.9 million, from the 2014 fourth quarter (12-week period), which reflects $43.4 million of sales due to the additional week in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the $10.0 million incremental contribution from acquired and new supermarkets opened since May 2015, partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease in sales attributable to 27 in-store pharmacies closed in January 2015.  Same store sales, which exclude the sales of the 27 closed in-store pharmacies, decreased 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a comparable 12-week comparison.  
Fuel sales were negatively impacted by a 33.2% decline in the average retail price per gallon, and as a result, were $32.2 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 26.0%, from the prior-year period.  This decrease was partially offset by a 10.7% increase in the number of gallons sold, largely due to the additional week in the 2015 period.  As of January 2, 2016, 52 corporate fuel stations were in operation.  
Overall, net sales increased $27.6 million, or 4.8%, to $602.4 million.

 


                                The following information was filed by TOPS HOLDING II CORP on Wednesday, March 23, 2016 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is a press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.

Generated $54.6 million of cash from operations in 2015; up 43% over prior year Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 million to $30.4 million compared with the prior yearAdded five supermarket locations in 2015   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., March  23, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Tops Holding II Corporation (“Tops” or the “Company”), the indirect parent of Tops Markets, LLC (“Tops Markets”), a leading supermarket retailer serving Upstate New York, Northern Pennsylvania and Vermont, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2016. “We continued to make progress in 2015.  We added five new locations during the year, completed a number of significant and minor store remodels, upgraded our POS system, and importantly, ended the year with encouraging market share trends throughout our footprint.  We also greatly enhanced our financial flexibility as we completed our debt refinancing earlier in the year,” commented Frank Curci, Tops Chairman and CEO.  “The year was not without its challenges, with historically low inflation, the weak Canadian dollar, which significantly reduced the number of Canadian shoppers at stores in our Buffalo/Niagara market area, and unseasonably warm weather, which allowed for more mobility and eating out during the fourth quarter.  Despite those headwinds, we continued to execute our strategy as we generated significant cash to support our debt pay down and growth initiatives.”  Mr. Curci added, “As we embark on 2016, we will continue to drive our strategy and our focus on debt reduction.  Despite some of the top line challenges we faced in 2015 continuing into 2016, fill-in acquisitions, continued growth from recent additions to our portfolio of supermarkets, and a number of merchandising and marketing initiatives are expected to drive overall growth.”    Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter Financial Results Inside sales were $570.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (13-week period), up 7.3%, or $38.9 million, from the 2014 fourth quarter (12-week period), which reflects $43.4 million of sales due to the additional week in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the $10.0 million incremental contribution from acquired and new supermarkets opened since May 2015, partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease in sales attributable to 27 in-store pharmacies closed in January 2015.  Same store sales, which exclude the sales of the 27 closed in-store pharmacies, decreased 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a comparable 12-week comparison.  Fuel sales were negatively impacted by a 33.2% decline in the average retail price per gallon, and as a result, were $32.2 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 26.0%, from the prior-year period.  This decrease was partially offset by a 10.7% increase in the number of gallons sold, largely due to the additional week in the 2015 period.  As of January 2, 2016, 52 corporate fuel stations were in operation.  Overall, net sales increased $27.6 million, or 4.8%, to $602.4 million. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $178.3 million, or 29.6% of net sales, compared with $160.2 million, or 27.9% of net sales, in the 2014 fourth quarter.  The 170 basis point increase in gross margin reflects higher profitability on fuel sales and product mix due to a smaller proportion of relatively lower margin fuel sales.  The improvement also reflects savings associated with the amendment of certain operating terms of our procurement agreement with C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. effective April 1, 2015.  Total operating expenses were $172.4 million, a $24.4 million increase from $148.0 million in the prior-year period, and reflect the additional week in the 2015 fourth quarter, a $0.75 per hour increase in the New York State minimum wage that took effect January 1, 2015, $3.8 million of legal and professional fees incurred during the 2015 period related to the arbitration with the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund (“Teamsters Fund”), and higher performance-based bonus expense of $1.1 million.  Operating income for the 2015 fourth quarter was $6.0 million compared with $12.2 million in the 2014 fourth quarter.  Interest expense for the quarter was relatively consistent at $20.6 million as the reduction in interest expense that resulted from the June 2015 debt refinancing was offset by the impact of the additional week in the 2015 fourth quarter.  Net loss for the 2015 fourth quarter was $15.4 million compared with a net loss of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Full Year Review  Inside sales were $2.31 billion in fiscal 2015 (53-week period), up $30.0 million, or 1.3%, from fiscal 2014 (52-week period).  The increase reflects $43.4 million of sales related to the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the $28.3 million incremental contribution from acquired and new locations opened since June 2014.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $33.3 million reduction in pharmacy sales attributable to the closure of 27 in-store pharmacies during January 2015.  Same store sales were down 30 basis points on a comparable 52-week basis, excluding sales from the 27 closed in-store pharmacies in both years.  Fuel sales declined 29.6% to $157.9 million due to a 31.9% decrease in the average retail price per gallon, partially offset by a 3.3% increase in the number of gallons sold.  Overall, fiscal 2015 net sales were $2.47 billion, down $36.4 million, or 1.4%, from the prior-year period.  Gross profit increased $21.8 million to $728.3 million, and was 29.5% of net sales, up 130 basis points over the 2014 period.  The increase in gross profit and margin reflects similar items as the fourth quarter as well as an improvement in non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments.   The amended operating terms of our C&S procurement agreement resulted in total savings of $5.6 million in fiscal 2015, of which $4.5 million was recorded in distribution costs and  $1.1 million in cost of goods sold.    Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% and 25.7% in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The 2015 period included an increase in the New York State minimum wage, an increase in bonus expense of $8.2 million, and $4.6 million of legal and professional fees incurred during fiscal 2015 related to the arbitration with the Teamsters Fund.  Partially offsetting these increases was a gain of $11.0 million from the January 2015 sale of pharmacy scripts.  Operating income was $58.4 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of 3.9%, or $2.4 million, from fiscal 2014.  Interest expense of $84.1 million was relatively consistent with the 2014 period.  The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $34.5 million in the 2015 second quarter in connection with its June 2015 debt refinancing.  As a result, net loss for fiscal 2015 was $62.2 million compared with a net loss of $14.7 million in fiscal 2014.  Supplemental Reporting on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with greater understanding of its operating performance, in addition to reporting results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), Tops provides supplemental reporting on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA was $25.0 million, compared with $28.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain non-cash and nonrecurring items, was $30.4 million, up $1.8 million, or 6.4%, from $28.5 million in the prior-year period.  For fiscal 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was $132.7 million, down $2.5 million from $135.2 million in fiscal 2014, reflecting an $8.9 million increase in bonus expense. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and the attached table for a reconciliation to GAAP net loss. Liquidity Cash and cash equivalents were $35.6 million at January 2, 2016, compared with $26.3 million at December 27, 2014.  Cash provided by operating activities during the 2015 period was $54.6 million, up $16.5 million, or 43.2%, from $38.1 million during the 2014 period.  The increase primarily reflects $15.2 million of transaction costs related to the December 2013 management purchase that were paid during the 2014 period. Cash provided by operating activities supported growth initiatives, including $37.7 million in capital expenditures that were largely related to new store openings, store remodels and maintenance activities, and $3.6 million for supermarket acquisitions.  The Company anticipates investing between $30 million and $35 million in capital expenditures in 2016. As of January 2, 2016, total debt excluding capital leases was $683.4 million, compared with $651.1 million at 2014 year-end.  On June 10, 2015, the Company issued in aggregate principal amount $560.0 million of senior secured notes due in 2022, bearing annual interest of 8.0% (the “2022 Notes”).  The proceeds from the 2022 Notes were used to redeem the previously outstanding $460.0 million of 8.875% notes due in 2017 and redeem $60.0 million of the 8.75% notes due in 2018, including redemption premiums of $23.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Outstanding borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility were $46.7 million as of January 2, 2016, down $5.3 million from $52.0 million as of December 27, 2014.  The unused availability under the revolving credit facility was $40.8 million after giving effect to the borrowing base calculation and $23.8 million of letters of credit outstanding.  Tops expects that cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund debt service requirements, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Conference Call Details Tops will host a conference call on Thursday, March 24, 2016, beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  During the call, management will review the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year period, and discuss Tops’ corporate strategy and outlook.  A question-and-answer session will follow.  The conference call can be accessed by dialing (201) 689-8560.

Safe Harbor StatementThe information made available in this news release contains forward-looking statements, which are generally statements about future events, plans, objectives and performance.  Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations, based on currently available information, and are not guarantees.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, these expectations could prove inaccurate as such statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties, or other risks or uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.  Important factors relating to these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following: current economic conditions and the impact on consumer demand and spending and our pricing strategy;pricing and market strategies, the expansion, consolidation and other activities of competitors, and our ability to respond to the promotional practices of competitors;our ability to effectively increase or maintain our profit margins;the success of our store acquisition, construction and remodel programs;fluctuations in utility, fuel and commodity prices which could impact consumer spending and buying habits and the cost of doing business;risks inherent in our fuel station operations;our exposure to local economies and other adverse conditions due to our geographic concentration;risks of natural disasters and severe weather conditions;supply problems with our suppliers and vendors;our relationships with unions and unionized employees, and the terms of future collective bargaining agreements or labor strikes;increased operating costs resulting from increases in the minimum wage, rising employee benefit costs or pension funding obligations;changes in, or the failure or inability to comply with, laws and governmental regulations applicable to the operation of our pharmacy and other businesses;the adequacy of our insurance coverage against claims of our customers in connection with our pharmacy services;estimates of the amount and timing of payments under our self-insurance policies;risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations;our ability to maintain and improve our information technology systems;events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or any adverse publicity relating to these types of concerns, whether or not valid;threats or potential threats to security;our ability to retain key personnel;risks of data security breaches or losses of confidential customer information;risks relating to our substantial indebtedness;claims or legal proceedings against us; andother factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide information regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  We define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items and items that are not indicative of our core operating performance.  We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and liquidity, and they are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting for future periods.  We believe the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and, with respect to EBITDA, makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures.  See the last page of this release for a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which we believe is net loss.

(f)  During January 2015, the Company sold pharmacy scripts and inventory related to 27 of its in-store pharmacy locations for cash proceeds of $14.9 million. A resulting gain on sale of assets of $11.0 million, net of the carrying value of sold inventory of $3.2 million and direct selling expenses of $0.7 million, was recognized.(g) The amount for Fiscal 2015 includes $1.0 million of severance and other non-recurring costs associated with the closure of 27 in-store pharmacies in January 2015.  For more information contact:

Tops Holding LLC and Tops Markets II Corporation Announce Early Results of Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation and Extension of Deadline for Receipt of Total Exchange Consideration
Tops Holding LLC and Tops Markets II Corporation Announce Early Results of Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation and Extension of Deadline for Receipt of Total Exchange Consideration

07/24/2017
 Tops Holding LLC and Tops Markets II Corporation Announce Early Results of Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation and Extension of Deadline for Receipt of Total Exchange Consideration   Tops Holding LLC and Tops Markets II Corporation (the “Issuers”) today announced the early tender results for their previously announced exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to certain eligible noteholders described below to exchange any and all of the outstanding $85,514,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.750%/9.500% Senior Notes due 2018 (CUSIP / ISIN Nos 89078XAB3 / US89078XAB38) (the “HoldCo Notes”) issued by Tops Holding II Corporation for a combination of new 9.000% Senior Amortizing Notes due 2021 (the “OpCo Notes”) and cash consideration. 

  According to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the exchange agent and information agent for the Exchange Offer, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 21, 2017 (the “Early Deadline”), the Issuers had received tenders and consents from holders of $76,426,000 in aggregate principal amount of the HoldCo Notes, representing approximately 89.37% of the total outstanding principal amount of the HoldCo Notes.   Accordingly, the Issuers have received consents sufficient to approve the proposed amendments to the indenture governing the HoldCo Notes (the “Consent Solicitation”), and Tops Holding II Corporation and the trustee for the HoldCo Notes will enter into a supplemental indenture containing such amendments. Such amendments will not become effective and operative, with respect to any HoldCo Notes that remain outstanding following the settlement of the Exchange Offer, unless and until the Issuers accept for exchange the HoldCo Notes validly tendered in the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation.   As the condition that Eligible Holders representing at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of HoldCo Notes tender their HoldCo Notes in the Exchange Offer has not been met, the Issuers also announced that they have extended the date by which tenders must be received for holders to receive the “Total Exchange Consideration” of $883.50 in principal amount of OpCo Notes and $116.50 in cash consideration per $1,000 principal amount of HoldCo Notes to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 4, 2017, which date and time is the “Expiration Date” for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. Accordingly, all HoldCo Notes tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date, including those tendered at or prior to the Early Deadline, will be eligible to receive the Total Exchange Consideration, plus accrued and unpaid interest in cash on HoldCo Notes accepted for exchange through, but not including, the settlement date for the Exchange Offer. All other terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation remain unchanged. The Withdrawal Deadline and Early Deadline have expired. HoldCo Notes tendered for exchange may not be validly withdrawn and consents may not be revoked, unless the Issuers determine in the future in their sole discretion to permit withdrawal and revocation rights.   Available Documents and Other Details   Documents relating to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation will only be distributed to holders of HoldCo Notes who complete and return an eligibility form confirming that they are either a “qualified institutional buyer” under Rule 144A or not a “U.S. person” under Regulation S for purposes of applicable securities laws (“Eligible Holders”). Holders of HoldCo Notes who desire to complete an eligibility form should either visit the website for this purpose at http://www.dfking.com/tops or request instructions by sending an e-mail to tops@dfking.com or calling D.F. King & Co., Inc., the information agent for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, at (877) 478-5040 (U.S. Toll-free) or (212) 269-5550 (Collect).   The Opco Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any other applicable securities laws and, unless so registered, the Opco Notes may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to or for the account of any U.S. person, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements thereof. Accordingly, the Opco Notes are being offered and issued only (i) to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and (ii) outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
