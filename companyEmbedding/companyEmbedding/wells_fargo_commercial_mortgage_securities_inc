    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Wells Fargo can help you with the complex process of defeasing a loan. Our defeasance clients include individual borrowers, institutional investors, financial institutions, investment banks, and third-party investment groups.    Why Wells Fargo?    What is Defeasance?    Upcoming Events     The Wells Fargo advantage   Experienced team. We have been conducting defeasance transactions since 2004. In the last 12+ years, we have closed more than 7,500 defeasance transactions totaling more than $88 billion. Of those transactions we have been the defeasance consultant on over half.   Simplified process. By acting in multiple defeasance roles on your behalf, we eliminate the complexity of having additional parties involved and therefore provide a comprehensive approach.        Lower costs. We offer free quotes based on real time pricing and our strong relationships with third-party vendors allow us to negotiate on your behalf and pass the savings along to you.     Defeasance is the process by which the real estate collateral securing a mortgage loan is replaced by government securities in order to release the real estate collateral, while keeping the payment stream for the mortgage loan intact. The release of the original collateral allows the borrower to sell or refinance the real estate.    Visit the Wells Fargo booth at these upcoming tradeshows: ICSC Carolinas Conference & Deal Making March 20-21, 2017  Charlotte, NC ICSC RECon The Global Retail Real Estate Convention  May 21-24, 2017  Las Vegas, NV

Wells Fargo & Company is an American international banking and financial services holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with "hubquarters" throughout the country.[2] It is the world's second-largest bank by market capitalization[3] and the third largest bank in the U.S. by assets.[4] In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC,[4] before slipping behind JP Morgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by thousands of Wells Fargo employees.[3] Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup Inc. to become the third-largest U.S. bank by assets at the end of 2015. Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
In 2016, Wells Fargo ranked 7th on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world[5] and ranked 27th on the Fortune 500 list of largest companies in the United States.[6] In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world.[5] As of October 2015, the company had a credit rating of AA−.[7] However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA-rated bank, reflecting the highest credit rating from two firms.[8]
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the "Big Four Banks" of the United States.[9] As of December 31, 2015, it had 8,700 retail branches and 13,000 automated teller machines.[5] The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally.[5]
In February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second year running[10] in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.[11] Following the emergence in September 2016 of the scandals involving unauthorized cross-selling and the creation of fake accounts, Wells Fargo in October 2016 became the largest bank ever to lose its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau[12] and was also placed under investigation by the California attorney general for alleged criminal identity theft during the creation of millions of accounts without customer consent.[13] Separately in October 2016, Wells Fargo settled upon a payout for a racketeering lawsuit alleging the overcharging of hundreds of thousands of homeowners by the bank for appraisals ordered after defaults on the customers' mortgage loans.[14] In December 2016, following the scandal, the company amended its by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO.[15] In January 2017, it emerged that Wells Fargo had kept its talks with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the fake account investigation silent from shareholders for up to six months beginning as early as March 2016.[16]
A regulatory filing by Wells Fargo revealed in November 2016 that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its accounts sales practices.[17] Also in November 2016, three U.S. senators alleged that Wells Fargo's sales scandal had extended from retail bankers to its brokerage employees,[18] and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placed new monitoring restrictions upon Wells Fargo's hiring of new executives, payments of "golden parachutes" to exiting managers, and branch openings and closures.[19] In December 2016, Bloomberg News reported that regulators in California and New Jersey announced that Wells Fargo was under investigation to determine whether the bank signed up customers for Prudential Financial life insurance policies without their permission, and that Prudential announced it was suspending distribution of such policies through Wells Fargo.[20] In June 2017, it was revealed that a new class action lawsuit stated that Wells Fargo made unauthorized alterations in the home loans of borrowers in bankruptcy that would ultimately charge these customers more in mortgage payments over the long term.[21] In July 2017, Wells Fargo apologized for charging as many as 570,000 customers with unnecessary automobile insurance costs, which may have caused about 20,000 of them to default on their car loans.[22]

Current operations[edit]




Map of Wells Fargo branches.


Wells Fargo delineates three different business segments when reporting results: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement.
Community banking[edit]
The Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products, and the Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center, and Credit Card Customer Service). Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand-alone mortgage branches throughout the country.[23] There are many mini-branches located inside of other buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually contain ATMs, basic teller services, and, space permitting, an office for private meetings with customers.[24] In March 2017, Wells Fargo announced a plan to offer smartphone-based transactions with mobile wallets including Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.[25]
Consumer lending[edit]
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is the largest retail mortgage lender in the United States, as of Q3 2011, originating one out of every four home loans.[26] Wells Fargo services $1.8 trillion in home mortgages, the second largest servicing portfolio in the U.S.[27] It was reported in 2012 Wells Fargo reached 30% market share for US mortgages, however, the then-CEO John Stumpf had said the numbers were misleading because about half of that share represented the aggregation of smaller loans that were then sold on in the secondary market. Now, in 2013 its share is closer to 22%; of which eight percentage points is aggregation.[28]
Wells Fargo private student loans[edit]
Wells Fargo private student loans are available to students to pay for eligible college expenses, such as tuition, books, computers, or housing.[29] Loans are available for undergraduate, career and community colleges, graduate school, law school and medical school. Wells Fargo also provides private student loan consolidation and student loans for parents.
Wholesale banking[edit]
Its wholesale banking segment contains products sold to large and middle market commercial companies, as well as to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).
Equipment lending[edit]
Wells Fargo has various divisions that finance and lease equipment to all manner of companies. One venture is Wells Fargo Rail, which in 2015 completed the purchase of GE Capital Rail Services and merged in with First Union Rail. Wells Fargo Equipment Finance is the country's largest equipment financer and nearly doubled in size after it purchased GE Capital's equipment finance division effective March 1, 2016.
Wealth and Investment Management[edit]




Wells Fargo Advisors headquarters in St. Louis


Wells Fargo offers investment products through its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Investments, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as well as through national broker/dealer firms. Mutual funds are offered under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds brand name. The company also serves high-net-worth individuals through its private bank and family wealth group.







Wells Fargo Advisors is the brokerage subsidiary of Wells Fargo, located in St. Louis. It is the third largest brokerage firm in the United States as of the third quarter of 2010 with $1.1 trillion retail client assets under management.[5]
Wells Fargo Advisors was known as Wachovia Securities until May 1, 2009, when it legally changed names following the Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia Corporation.

The Seagram Building: Home of Wells Fargo Securities' New York offices and trading floors


Wells Fargo Securities ("WFS") is the investment banking division of Wells Fargo & Co. The size and financial performance of the group is not disclosed publicly, but analysts believe the investment banking group houses approximately 4,500 employees and generates between $3 and $4 billion per year in investment banking revenue. By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase generated approximately $5.5 billion and $6 billion respectively in 2011 (not including sales and trading revenue).[30] WFS headquarters is in Charlotte, North Carolina, with other U.S. offices in New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and international offices in London and Hong Kong.
Cross-selling[edit]
A key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products.[31] Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers in an attempt to increase the customer's profitability to the bank, and to make it more difficult for the customer to switch to a different bank.[32][33] Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by The Wall Street Journal as a hard sell technique);[32] Forbes magazine describes Wells Fargo as "better than anyone" at the practice.[33]
International operations[edit]
Wells Fargo provides banking services throughout the world, with offices in Hong Kong, London, Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto, and India.[34][35]
Charter[edit]
Wells Fargo operates under Charter #1, the first national bank charter issued in the United States. This charter was issued to First National Bank of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.[36] Traditionally, acquiring banks assume the earliest issued charter number. Thus, the first charter passed from First National Bank of Philadelphia to Wells Fargo through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had inherited it through one of its many acquisitions.
History[edit]
Main article: History of Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo History Museums[edit]
The company operates 11 museums, most known as a Wells Fargo History Museum,[37] in its corporate buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, Los Angeles, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Phoenix, Arizona, Portland, Oregon, Sacramento, California and San Francisco, California. Displays include original stagecoaches, photographs, gold nuggets and mining artifacts, the Pony Express, telegraph equipment and historic bank artifacts. The company also operates a museum about company history in the Pony Express Terminal in Old Sacramento State Historic Park in Sacramento, California, which was the company's second office,[38] and the Wells Fargo History Museum in Old Town San Diego State Historic Park in San Diego, California.[39]
Wells Fargo operates the Alaska Heritage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, which features a large collection of Alaskan Native artifacts, ivory carvings and baskets, fine art by Alaskan artists, and displays about Wells Fargo history in the Alaskan Gold Rush era.[40]

Wachovia acquisition[edit]




A former Wachovia branch converted to Wells Fargo in the fall of 2011 in Durham, North Carolina.


On October 3, 2008, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8 billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to have Citigroup buy Wachovia for $2.1 billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.[56]
On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the situation was sorted out.[57] Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court.[58] Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of $60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.[59]
Investment by U.S. Treasury during 2008 financial crisis[edit]
On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo was the recipient of $25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the US Treasury.[60][61] Tests by the Federal government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional $13.7 billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009 Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009 raising $8.6 billion in capital. The remaining $4.9 billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the $25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of $131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to $1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.[62]
History of Wells Fargo Securities[edit]
Wells Fargo Securities was established in 2009 to house Wells Fargo's capital markets group which it obtained during the Wachovia acquisition. Prior to that point, Wells Fargo had little to no participation in investment banking activities, though Wachovia had a well established investment banking practice which it operated under the Wachovia Securities banner.
Wachovia's institutional capital markets and investment banking business arose from the merger of Wachovia and First Union. First Union had bought Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. on April 30, 1998 adding to its merger and acquisition, high yield, leveraged finance, equity underwriting, private placement, loan syndication, risk management, and public finance capabilities.[63]
Legacy components of Wells Fargo Securities include Wachovia Securities, Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co., Barrington Associates, Halsey, Stuart & Co., Leopold Cahn & Co., Bache & Co.. Prudential Securities, A.G. Edwards, Inc. and the investment banking arm of Citadel LLC.[64]

Environmental record[edit]

In 2009, Wells Fargo ranked #1 among banks and insurance companies, and #13 overall, in Newsweek Magazine’s inaugural "Green Rankings" of the country’s 500 largest companies.[66]
So far, Wells Fargo has provided more than $6 billion in financing for environmentally beneficial business opportunities, including supporting 185 commercial-scale solar photovoltaic projects and 27 utility-scale wind projects nationwide.[67]
As a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program, Wells Fargo aims to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its U.S. operations by 20% below 2008 levels by 2018.
Wells Fargo has launched what it believes to be the first blog among its industry peers to report on its environmental stewardship and to solicit feedback and ideas from its stakeholders.[68]

"We want to be as open and clear as possible about our environmental efforts – both our accomplishments and challenges – and share our experiences, ideas and thoughts as we work to integrate environmental responsibility into everything we do," said Mary Wenzel, director of Environmental Affairs. "We also want to hear and learn from our customers. By working together, we can do even more to protect and preserve natural resources for future generations."

Controversies[edit]




A Wells Fargo branch in Logan, Utah


Higher costs charged to African-American and Hispanic borrowers[edit]
Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Wells Fargo on July 31, 2009, alleging that the bank steers African Americans and Hispanics into high-cost subprime loans. A Wells Fargo spokesman responded that "The policies, systems, and controls we have in place – including in Illinois – ensure race is not a factor..."[69] According to Beth Jacobson, a loan officer at Wells Fargo interviewed for a report in The New York Times, "We just went right after them. Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans." The report goes on to present data from the city of Baltimore, where "more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods."[70]
Failure to monitor suspected money laundering[edit]
In a March 2010 agreement with federal prosecutors, Wells Fargo acknowledged that between 2004 and 2007 Wachovia had failed to monitor and report suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers, including the cash used to buy four planes that shipped a total of 22 tons of cocaine into Mexico.[71]
Overdraft fees[edit]
In August 2010, Wells Fargo was fined by U.S. District Judge William Alsup for overdraft practices designed to "gouge" consumers and "profiteer" at their expense, and for misleading consumers about how the bank processed transactions and assessed overdraft fees.[72][73][74]
Settlement and fines regarding mortgage servicing practices[edit]
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[75] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[76] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.
On April 5, 2012, a federal judge ordered Wells Fargo to pay $3.1 million in punitive damages over a single loan, one of the largest fines for a bank ever for mortgaging service misconduct.[77] Elizabeth Magner, a federal bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, cited the bank's behavior as "highly reprehensible",[78] stating that Wells Fargo has taken advantage of borrowers who rely on the bank's accurate calculations. She went on to add, "perhaps more disturbing is Wells Fargo's refusal to voluntarily correct its errors. It prefers to rely on the ignorance of borrowers or their inability to fund a challenge to its demands, rather than voluntarily relinquish gains obtained through improper accounting methods."[79]
Alleged racial discrimination during foreclosures[edit]
In 2011, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched an investigation of Wells Fargo for racial discrimination practices, the second federal probe in 2012 of alleged violations of misconduct with regard to race. The other, began in 2011 by the National Fair Housing Alliance has found "overwhelming" and "troubling" evidence that six of the nation's major banks handle foreclosures in neighborhoods populated primarily by minorities differently than in white communities.[80]
On July 13, 2012, Wells Fargo entered a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice for allegedly discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers from 2004 to 2009. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $125 million to subprime borrowers and $50 million in direct down payment assistance in certain areas, for a total of $175 million.[81][82] Wells Fargo spokespersons denied all claims and are settling only to avoid contested litigation.[82][83]
SEC fine due to inadequate risk disclosures[edit]
On August 14, 2012, Wells Fargo agreed to pay around $6.5 million to settle SEC charges that in 2007 it sold risky mortgage-backed securities without fully realizing their dangers.[84][85]
Lawsuit by FHA over loan underwriting[edit]
On October 9, 2012, the U.S. federal government sued the bank under the False Claims Act at the federal court in Manhattan, New York. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo defrauded the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the past ten years, underwriting over 100,000 FHA backed loans when over half did not qualify for the program. This suit is the third allegation levied against Wells Fargo in 2012.[86]
In October 2012, Wells Fargo was sued by U.S. federal attorney Preet Bharara over questionable mortgage deals.[87]
Lawsuit due to premium inflation on forced place insurance[edit]
In April 2013, Wells Fargo settled a suit with 24,000 Florida homeowners alongside insurer QBE, in which Wells Fargo was accused of inflating premiums on forced-place insurance.[88]
Lawsuit regarding excessive overdraft fees[edit]
In May 2013, Wells Fargo paid $203 million to settle class-action litigation accusing the bank of imposing excessive overdraft fees on checking-account customers. Also in May, the New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a lawsuit against Wells Fargo over alleged violations of the national mortgage settlement, a $25 billion deal struck between 49 state attorneys and the five-largest mortgage servicers in the US. Schneidermann claimed Wells Fargo had violated rules over giving fair and timely serving.[28]
2015 Violation of New York credit card laws[edit]
In February 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $4 million for violations where an affiliate took interest in the homes of borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for the homeowners. This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a $2 million penalty with the other $2 million going towards restitution to customers.[89]
Executive compensation[edit]
With CEO John Stumpf being paid 473 times more than the median employee, Wells Fargo ranks number 33 among the S&P 500 companies for CEO–employee pay inequality. In October 2014, a Wells Fargo employee earning $15 per hour emailed the CEO – copying 200,000 other employees – asking that all employees be given a $10,000 per year raise taken from a portion of annual corporate profits to address wage stagnation and income inequality. After being contacted by the media, Wells Fargo responded that all employees receive "market competitive" pay and benefits significantly above federal minimums.[90][91]
Tax avoidance and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Wells Fargo for spending $11 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $681 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $49 billion, laying off 6,385 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 180% to $49.8 million in 2010 for its top five executives.[92] As of 2014 however, at an effective tax rate of 31.2% of its income, Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest payer of corporation tax in the U.S.[93]
Prison industry investment[edit]
Main article: Prison–industrial complex
The GEO Group, Inc., a multi-national provider of for-profit private prisons, received investments made by Wells Fargo mutual funds on behalf of clients, not investments made by Wells Fargo and Company, according to company statements.[94] By March 2012, its stake had grown to more than 4.4 million shares worth $86.7 million.[95] As of November, 2012, the latest SEC filings reveal that Wells Fargo has divested 33% of its dispositive holdings of GEO's stock, which reduces Wells Fargo's holdings to 4.98% of Geo Group's common stock. By reducing its holdings to less than 5%, Wells Fargo will no longer be required to disclose some financial dealings with GEO.[96]
While a coalition of organizations, National People's Action Campaign, have seen some success in pressuring Wells Fargo to divest from private prison companies like GEO Group, the company continues to make such investments.[97]
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fines[edit]
Main article: Wells Fargo account fraud scandal
In September 2016, Wells Fargo was issued a combined total of $185 million in fines for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, the largest in the agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency.[98] The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted.[99] Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package.[100][101] On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically.[102] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank,[103] S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable,[104] and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company.[105] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them.[106] The board chose to use a clawback clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.[106]
Racketeering lawsuit for mortgage appraisal overcharges[edit]
In November 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit in which the bank was accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans. While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners $95 to $125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged $50 or less. The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.[107]
Dakota Access Pipeline investment[edit]
Wells Fargo is a top investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota, a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline project in the United States. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its necessity, and potential impact on the environment.[108]
In February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo "in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its "creation of millions of bogus accounts." and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve "social responsibility." The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.[109]
Failure to comply with document security requirements[edit]
In December 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Wells Fargo $5.5 million for failing to store electronic documents in a "write once, read many" format, which makes it impossible to alter or destroy records after they are written.[110]
SEC settlement for insider trading case[edit]
In 2015, an analyst at Wells Fargo settled an insider trading case with the SEC. The former employee was charged with insider trading alongside an ex-Wells Fargo trader.[111] Sadis & Goldberg obtained a settlement that permitted the client to continue in securities industry, while neither admitting nor denying one charge of negligence-based § 17(a)(3) claim, and paying a $75,000 civil penalty[112]

Wells Fargo & Company is an American international banking and financial services holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with "hubquarters" throughout the country.[2] It is the world's second-largest bank by market capitalization[3] and the third largest bank in the U.S. by assets.[4] In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC,[4] before slipping behind JP Morgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by thousands of Wells Fargo employees.[3] Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup Inc. to become the third-largest U.S. bank by assets at the end of 2015. Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
In 2016, Wells Fargo ranked 7th on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world[5] and ranked 27th on the Fortune 500 list of largest companies in the United States.[6] In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world.[5] As of October 2015, the company had a credit rating of AA−.[7] However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA-rated bank, reflecting the highest credit rating from two firms.[8]
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the "Big Four Banks" of the United States.[9] As of December 31, 2015, it had 8,700 retail branches and 13,000 automated teller machines.[5] The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally.[5]
In February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second year running[10] in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.[11] Following the emergence in September 2016 of the scandals involving unauthorized cross-selling and the creation of fake accounts, Wells Fargo in October 2016 became the largest bank ever to lose its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau[12] and was also placed under investigation by the California attorney general for alleged criminal identity theft during the creation of millions of accounts without customer consent.[13] Separately in October 2016, Wells Fargo settled upon a payout for a racketeering lawsuit alleging the overcharging of hundreds of thousands of homeowners by the bank for appraisals ordered after defaults on the customers' mortgage loans.[14] In December 2016, following the scandal, the company amended its by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO.[15] In January 2017, it emerged that Wells Fargo had kept its talks with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the fake account investigation silent from shareholders for up to six months beginning as early as March 2016.[16]
A regulatory filing by Wells Fargo revealed in November 2016 that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its accounts sales practices.[17] Also in November 2016, three U.S. senators alleged that Wells Fargo's sales scandal had extended from retail bankers to its brokerage employees,[18] and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placed new monitoring restrictions upon Wells Fargo's hiring of new executives, payments of "golden parachutes" to exiting managers, and branch openings and closures.[19] In December 2016, Bloomberg News reported that regulators in California and New Jersey announced that Wells Fargo was under investigation to determine whether the bank signed up customers for Prudential Financial life insurance policies without their permission, and that Prudential announced it was suspending distribution of such policies through Wells Fargo.[20] In June 2017, it was revealed that a new class action lawsuit stated that Wells Fargo made unauthorized alterations in the home loans of borrowers in bankruptcy that would ultimately charge these customers more in mortgage payments over the long term.[21] In July 2017, Wells Fargo apologized for charging as many as 570,000 customers with unnecessary automobile insurance costs, which may have caused about 20,000 of them to default on their car loans.[22]

Map of Wells Fargo branches.


Wells Fargo delineates three different business segments when reporting results: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement.
Community banking[edit]
The Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products, and the Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center, and Credit Card Customer Service). Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand-alone mortgage branches throughout the country.[23] There are many mini-branches located inside of other buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually contain ATMs, basic teller services, and, space permitting, an office for private meetings with customers.[24] In March 2017, Wells Fargo announced a plan to offer smartphone-based transactions with mobile wallets including Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.[25]
Consumer lending[edit]
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is the largest retail mortgage lender in the United States, as of Q3 2011, originating one out of every four home loans.[26] Wells Fargo services $1.8 trillion in home mortgages, the second largest servicing portfolio in the U.S.[27] It was reported in 2012 Wells Fargo reached 30% market share for US mortgages, however, the then-CEO John Stumpf had said the numbers were misleading because about half of that share represented the aggregation of smaller loans that were then sold on in the secondary market. Now, in 2013 its share is closer to 22%; of which eight percentage points is aggregation.[28]
Wells Fargo private student loans[edit]
Wells Fargo private student loans are available to students to pay for eligible college expenses, such as tuition, books, computers, or housing.[29] Loans are available for undergraduate, career and community colleges, graduate school, law school and medical school. Wells Fargo also provides private student loan consolidation and student loans for parents.
Wholesale banking[edit]
Its wholesale banking segment contains products sold to large and middle market commercial companies, as well as to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).
Equipment lending[edit]
Wells Fargo has various divisions that finance and lease equipment to all manner of companies. One venture is Wells Fargo Rail, which in 2015 completed the purchase of GE Capital Rail Services and merged in with First Union Rail. Wells Fargo Equipment Finance is the country's largest equipment financer and nearly doubled in size after it purchased GE Capital's equipment finance division effective March 1, 2016.
Wealth and Investment Management[edit]




Wells Fargo Advisors headquarters in St. Louis


Wells Fargo offers investment products through its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Investments, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as well as through national broker/dealer firms. Mutual funds are offered under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds brand name. The company also serves high-net-worth individuals through its private bank and family wealth group.







Wells Fargo Advisors is the brokerage subsidiary of Wells Fargo, located in St. Louis. It is the third largest brokerage firm in the United States as of the third quarter of 2010 with $1.1 trillion retail client assets under management.[5]
Wells Fargo Advisors was known as Wachovia Securities until May 1, 2009, when it legally changed names following the Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia Corporation.

The Seagram Building: Home of Wells Fargo Securities' New York offices and trading floors


Wells Fargo Securities ("WFS") is the investment banking division of Wells Fargo & Co. The size and financial performance of the group is not disclosed publicly, but analysts believe the investment banking group houses approximately 4,500 employees and generates between $3 and $4 billion per year in investment banking revenue. By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase generated approximately $5.5 billion and $6 billion respectively in 2011 (not including sales and trading revenue).[30] WFS headquarters is in Charlotte, North Carolina, with other U.S. offices in New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and international offices in London and Hong Kong.
Cross-selling[edit]
A key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products.[31] Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers in an attempt to increase the customer's profitability to the bank, and to make it more difficult for the customer to switch to a different bank.[32][33] Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by The Wall Street Journal as a hard sell technique);[32] Forbes magazine describes Wells Fargo as "better than anyone" at the practice.[33]
International operations[edit]
Wells Fargo provides banking services throughout the world, with offices in Hong Kong, London, Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto, and India.[34][35]
Charter[edit]
Wells Fargo operates under Charter #1, the first national bank charter issued in the United States. This charter was issued to First National Bank of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.[36] Traditionally, acquiring banks assume the earliest issued charter number. Thus, the first charter passed from First National Bank of Philadelphia to Wells Fargo through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had inherited it through one of its many acquisitions.
History[edit]
Main article: History of Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo History Museums[edit]
The company operates 11 museums, most known as a Wells Fargo History Museum,[37] in its corporate buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, Los Angeles, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Phoenix, Arizona, Portland, Oregon, Sacramento, California and San Francisco, California. Displays include original stagecoaches, photographs, gold nuggets and mining artifacts, the Pony Express, telegraph equipment and historic bank artifacts. The company also operates a museum about company history in the Pony Express Terminal in Old Sacramento State Historic Park in Sacramento, California, which was the company's second office,[38] and the Wells Fargo History Museum in Old Town San Diego State Historic Park in San Diego, California.[39]
Wells Fargo operates the Alaska Heritage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, which features a large collection of Alaskan Native artifacts, ivory carvings and baskets, fine art by Alaskan artists, and displays about Wells Fargo history in the Alaskan Gold Rush era.[40]

Wachovia acquisition[edit]




A former Wachovia branch converted to Wells Fargo in the fall of 2011 in Durham, North Carolina.


On October 3, 2008, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8 billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to have Citigroup buy Wachovia for $2.1 billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.[56]
On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the situation was sorted out.[57] Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court.[58] Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of $60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.[59]
Investment by U.S. Treasury during 2008 financial crisis[edit]
On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo was the recipient of $25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the US Treasury.[60][61] Tests by the Federal government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional $13.7 billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009 Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009 raising $8.6 billion in capital. The remaining $4.9 billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the $25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of $131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to $1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.[62]
History of Wells Fargo Securities[edit]
Wells Fargo Securities was established in 2009 to house Wells Fargo's capital markets group which it obtained during the Wachovia acquisition. Prior to that point, Wells Fargo had little to no participation in investment banking activities, though Wachovia had a well established investment banking practice which it operated under the Wachovia Securities banner.
Wachovia's institutional capital markets and investment banking business arose from the merger of Wachovia and First Union. First Union had bought Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. on April 30, 1998 adding to its merger and acquisition, high yield, leveraged finance, equity underwriting, private placement, loan syndication, risk management, and public finance capabilities.[63]
Legacy components of Wells Fargo Securities include Wachovia Securities, Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co., Barrington Associates, Halsey, Stuart & Co., Leopold Cahn & Co., Bache & Co.. Prudential Securities, A.G. Edwards, Inc. and the investment banking arm of Citadel LLC.[64]

In 2009, Wells Fargo ranked #1 among banks and insurance companies, and #13 overall, in Newsweek Magazine’s inaugural "Green Rankings" of the country’s 500 largest companies.[66]
So far, Wells Fargo has provided more than $6 billion in financing for environmentally beneficial business opportunities, including supporting 185 commercial-scale solar photovoltaic projects and 27 utility-scale wind projects nationwide.[67]
As a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program, Wells Fargo aims to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its U.S. operations by 20% below 2008 levels by 2018.
Wells Fargo has launched what it believes to be the first blog among its industry peers to report on its environmental stewardship and to solicit feedback and ideas from its stakeholders.[68]

"We want to be as open and clear as possible about our environmental efforts – both our accomplishments and challenges – and share our experiences, ideas and thoughts as we work to integrate environmental responsibility into everything we do," said Mary Wenzel, director of Environmental Affairs. "We also want to hear and learn from our customers. By working together, we can do even more to protect and preserve natural resources for future generations."

Controversies[edit]




A Wells Fargo branch in Logan, Utah


Higher costs charged to African-American and Hispanic borrowers[edit]
Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Wells Fargo on July 31, 2009, alleging that the bank steers African Americans and Hispanics into high-cost subprime loans. A Wells Fargo spokesman responded that "The policies, systems, and controls we have in place – including in Illinois – ensure race is not a factor..."[69] According to Beth Jacobson, a loan officer at Wells Fargo interviewed for a report in The New York Times, "We just went right after them. Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans." The report goes on to present data from the city of Baltimore, where "more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods."[70]
Failure to monitor suspected money laundering[edit]
In a March 2010 agreement with federal prosecutors, Wells Fargo acknowledged that between 2004 and 2007 Wachovia had failed to monitor and report suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers, including the cash used to buy four planes that shipped a total of 22 tons of cocaine into Mexico.[71]
Overdraft fees[edit]
In August 2010, Wells Fargo was fined by U.S. District Judge William Alsup for overdraft practices designed to "gouge" consumers and "profiteer" at their expense, and for misleading consumers about how the bank processed transactions and assessed overdraft fees.[72][73][74]
Settlement and fines regarding mortgage servicing practices[edit]
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[75] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[76] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.
On April 5, 2012, a federal judge ordered Wells Fargo to pay $3.1 million in punitive damages over a single loan, one of the largest fines for a bank ever for mortgaging service misconduct.[77] Elizabeth Magner, a federal bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, cited the bank's behavior as "highly reprehensible",[78] stating that Wells Fargo has taken advantage of borrowers who rely on the bank's accurate calculations. She went on to add, "perhaps more disturbing is Wells Fargo's refusal to voluntarily correct its errors. It prefers to rely on the ignorance of borrowers or their inability to fund a challenge to its demands, rather than voluntarily relinquish gains obtained through improper accounting methods."[79]
Alleged racial discrimination during foreclosures[edit]
In 2011, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched an investigation of Wells Fargo for racial discrimination practices, the second federal probe in 2012 of alleged violations of misconduct with regard to race. The other, began in 2011 by the National Fair Housing Alliance has found "overwhelming" and "troubling" evidence that six of the nation's major banks handle foreclosures in neighborhoods populated primarily by minorities differently than in white communities.[80]
On July 13, 2012, Wells Fargo entered a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice for allegedly discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers from 2004 to 2009. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $125 million to subprime borrowers and $50 million in direct down payment assistance in certain areas, for a total of $175 million.[81][82] Wells Fargo spokespersons denied all claims and are settling only to avoid contested litigation.[82][83]
SEC fine due to inadequate risk disclosures[edit]
On August 14, 2012, Wells Fargo agreed to pay around $6.5 million to settle SEC charges that in 2007 it sold risky mortgage-backed securities without fully realizing their dangers.[84][85]
Lawsuit by FHA over loan underwriting[edit]
On October 9, 2012, the U.S. federal government sued the bank under the False Claims Act at the federal court in Manhattan, New York. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo defrauded the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the past ten years, underwriting over 100,000 FHA backed loans when over half did not qualify for the program. This suit is the third allegation levied against Wells Fargo in 2012.[86]
In October 2012, Wells Fargo was sued by U.S. federal attorney Preet Bharara over questionable mortgage deals.[87]
Lawsuit due to premium inflation on forced place insurance[edit]
In April 2013, Wells Fargo settled a suit with 24,000 Florida homeowners alongside insurer QBE, in which Wells Fargo was accused of inflating premiums on forced-place insurance.[88]
Lawsuit regarding excessive overdraft fees[edit]
In May 2013, Wells Fargo paid $203 million to settle class-action litigation accusing the bank of imposing excessive overdraft fees on checking-account customers. Also in May, the New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a lawsuit against Wells Fargo over alleged violations of the national mortgage settlement, a $25 billion deal struck between 49 state attorneys and the five-largest mortgage servicers in the US. Schneidermann claimed Wells Fargo had violated rules over giving fair and timely serving.[28]
2015 Violation of New York credit card laws[edit]
In February 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $4 million for violations where an affiliate took interest in the homes of borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for the homeowners. This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a $2 million penalty with the other $2 million going towards restitution to customers.[89]
Executive compensation[edit]
With CEO John Stumpf being paid 473 times more than the median employee, Wells Fargo ranks number 33 among the S&P 500 companies for CEO–employee pay inequality. In October 2014, a Wells Fargo employee earning $15 per hour emailed the CEO – copying 200,000 other employees – asking that all employees be given a $10,000 per year raise taken from a portion of annual corporate profits to address wage stagnation and income inequality. After being contacted by the media, Wells Fargo responded that all employees receive "market competitive" pay and benefits significantly above federal minimums.[90][91]
Tax avoidance and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Wells Fargo for spending $11 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $681 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $49 billion, laying off 6,385 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 180% to $49.8 million in 2010 for its top five executives.[92] As of 2014 however, at an effective tax rate of 31.2% of its income, Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest payer of corporation tax in the U.S.[93]
Prison industry investment[edit]
Main article: Prison–industrial complex
The GEO Group, Inc., a multi-national provider of for-profit private prisons, received investments made by Wells Fargo mutual funds on behalf of clients, not investments made by Wells Fargo and Company, according to company statements.[94] By March 2012, its stake had grown to more than 4.4 million shares worth $86.7 million.[95] As of November, 2012, the latest SEC filings reveal that Wells Fargo has divested 33% of its dispositive holdings of GEO's stock, which reduces Wells Fargo's holdings to 4.98% of Geo Group's common stock. By reducing its holdings to less than 5%, Wells Fargo will no longer be required to disclose some financial dealings with GEO.[96]
While a coalition of organizations, National People's Action Campaign, have seen some success in pressuring Wells Fargo to divest from private prison companies like GEO Group, the company continues to make such investments.[97]
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fines[edit]
Main article: Wells Fargo account fraud scandal
In September 2016, Wells Fargo was issued a combined total of $185 million in fines for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, the largest in the agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency.[98] The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted.[99] Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package.[100][101] On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically.[102] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank,[103] S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable,[104] and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company.[105] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them.[106] The board chose to use a clawback clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.[106]
Racketeering lawsuit for mortgage appraisal overcharges[edit]
In November 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit in which the bank was accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans. While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners $95 to $125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged $50 or less. The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.[107]
Dakota Access Pipeline investment[edit]
Wells Fargo is a top investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota, a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline project in the United States. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its necessity, and potential impact on the environment.[108]
In February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo "in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its "creation of millions of bogus accounts." and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve "social responsibility." The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.[109]
Failure to comply with document security requirements[edit]
In December 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Wells Fargo $5.5 million for failing to store electronic documents in a "write once, read many" format, which makes it impossible to alter or destroy records after they are written.[110]
SEC settlement for insider trading case[edit]
In 2015, an analyst at Wells Fargo settled an insider trading case with the SEC. The former employee was charged with insider trading alongside an ex-Wells Fargo trader.[111] Sadis & Goldberg obtained a settlement that permitted the client to continue in securities industry, while neither admitting nor denying one charge of negligence-based § 17(a)(3) claim, and paying a $75,000 civil penalty[112]

Wells Fargo & Company is an American international banking and financial services holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with "hubquarters" throughout the country.[2] It is the world's second-largest bank by market capitalization[3] and the third largest bank in the U.S. by assets.[4] In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC,[4] before slipping behind JP Morgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by thousands of Wells Fargo employees.[3] Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup Inc. to become the third-largest U.S. bank by assets at the end of 2015. Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
In 2016, Wells Fargo ranked 7th on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world[5] and ranked 27th on the Fortune 500 list of largest companies in the United States.[6] In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world.[5] As of October 2015, the company had a credit rating of AA−.[7] However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA-rated bank, reflecting the highest credit rating from two firms.[8]
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the "Big Four Banks" of the United States.[9] As of December 31, 2015, it had 8,700 retail branches and 13,000 automated teller machines.[5] The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally.[5]
In February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second year running[10] in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.[11] Following the emergence in September 2016 of the scandals involving unauthorized cross-selling and the creation of fake accounts, Wells Fargo in October 2016 became the largest bank ever to lose its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau[12] and was also placed under investigation by the California attorney general for alleged criminal identity theft during the creation of millions of accounts without customer consent.[13] Separately in October 2016, Wells Fargo settled upon a payout for a racketeering lawsuit alleging the overcharging of hundreds of thousands of homeowners by the bank for appraisals ordered after defaults on the customers' mortgage loans.[14] In December 2016, following the scandal, the company amended its by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO.[15] In January 2017, it emerged that Wells Fargo had kept its talks with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the fake account investigation silent from shareholders for up to six months beginning as early as March 2016.[16]
A regulatory filing by Wells Fargo revealed in November 2016 that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its accounts sales practices.[17] Also in November 2016, three U.S. senators alleged that Wells Fargo's sales scandal had extended from retail bankers to its brokerage employees,[18] and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placed new monitoring restrictions upon Wells Fargo's hiring of new executives, payments of "golden parachutes" to exiting managers, and branch openings and closures.[19] In December 2016, Bloomberg News reported that regulators in California and New Jersey announced that Wells Fargo was under investigation to determine whether the bank signed up customers for Prudential Financial life insurance policies without their permission, and that Prudential announced it was suspending distribution of such policies through Wells Fargo.[20] In June 2017, it was revealed that a new class action lawsuit stated that Wells Fargo made unauthorized alterations in the home loans of borrowers in bankruptcy that would ultimately charge these customers more in mortgage payments over the long term.[21] In July 2017, Wells Fargo apologized for charging as many as 570,000 customers with unnecessary automobile insurance costs, which may have caused about 20,000 of them to default on their car loans.[22]

Current operations[edit]




Map of Wells Fargo branches.


Wells Fargo delineates three different business segments when reporting results: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement.
Community banking[edit]
The Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products, and the Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center, and Credit Card Customer Service). Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand-alone mortgage branches throughout the country.[23] There are many mini-branches located inside of other buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually contain ATMs, basic teller services, and, space permitting, an office for private meetings with customers.[24] In March 2017, Wells Fargo announced a plan to offer smartphone-based transactions with mobile wallets including Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.[25]
Consumer lending[edit]
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is the largest retail mortgage lender in the United States, as of Q3 2011, originating one out of every four home loans.[26] Wells Fargo services $1.8 trillion in home mortgages, the second largest servicing portfolio in the U.S.[27] It was reported in 2012 Wells Fargo reached 30% market share for US mortgages, however, the then-CEO John Stumpf had said the numbers were misleading because about half of that share represented the aggregation of smaller loans that were then sold on in the secondary market. Now, in 2013 its share is closer to 22%; of which eight percentage points is aggregation.[28]
Wells Fargo private student loans[edit]
Wells Fargo private student loans are available to students to pay for eligible college expenses, such as tuition, books, computers, or housing.[29] Loans are available for undergraduate, career and community colleges, graduate school, law school and medical school. Wells Fargo also provides private student loan consolidation and student loans for parents.
Wholesale banking[edit]
Its wholesale banking segment contains products sold to large and middle market commercial companies, as well as to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).
Equipment lending[edit]
Wells Fargo has various divisions that finance and lease equipment to all manner of companies. One venture is Wells Fargo Rail, which in 2015 completed the purchase of GE Capital Rail Services and merged in with First Union Rail. Wells Fargo Equipment Finance is the country's largest equipment financer and nearly doubled in size after it purchased GE Capital's equipment finance division effective March 1, 2016.
Wealth and Investment Management[edit]




Wells Fargo Advisors headquarters in St. Louis


Wells Fargo offers investment products through its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Investments, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as well as through national broker/dealer firms. Mutual funds are offered under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds brand name. The company also serves high-net-worth individuals through its private bank and family wealth group.







Wells Fargo Advisors is the brokerage subsidiary of Wells Fargo, located in St. Louis. It is the third largest brokerage firm in the United States as of the third quarter of 2010 with $1.1 trillion retail client assets under management.[5]
Wells Fargo Advisors was known as Wachovia Securities until May 1, 2009, when it legally changed names following the Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia Corporation.

The Seagram Building: Home of Wells Fargo Securities' New York offices and trading floors


Wells Fargo Securities ("WFS") is the investment banking division of Wells Fargo & Co. The size and financial performance of the group is not disclosed publicly, but analysts believe the investment banking group houses approximately 4,500 employees and generates between $3 and $4 billion per year in investment banking revenue. By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase generated approximately $5.5 billion and $6 billion respectively in 2011 (not including sales and trading revenue).[30] WFS headquarters is in Charlotte, North Carolina, with other U.S. offices in New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and international offices in London and Hong Kong.
Cross-selling[edit]
A key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products.[31] Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers in an attempt to increase the customer's profitability to the bank, and to make it more difficult for the customer to switch to a different bank.[32][33] Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by The Wall Street Journal as a hard sell technique);[32] Forbes magazine describes Wells Fargo as "better than anyone" at the practice.[33]
International operations[edit]
Wells Fargo provides banking services throughout the world, with offices in Hong Kong, London, Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto, and India.[34][35]
Charter[edit]
Wells Fargo operates under Charter #1, the first national bank charter issued in the United States. This charter was issued to First National Bank of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.[36] Traditionally, acquiring banks assume the earliest issued charter number. Thus, the first charter passed from First National Bank of Philadelphia to Wells Fargo through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had inherited it through one of its many acquisitions.
History[edit]
Main article: History of Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo History Museums[edit]
The company operates 11 museums, most known as a Wells Fargo History Museum,[37] in its corporate buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, Los Angeles, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Phoenix, Arizona, Portland, Oregon, Sacramento, California and San Francisco, California. Displays include original stagecoaches, photographs, gold nuggets and mining artifacts, the Pony Express, telegraph equipment and historic bank artifacts. The company also operates a museum about company history in the Pony Express Terminal in Old Sacramento State Historic Park in Sacramento, California, which was the company's second office,[38] and the Wells Fargo History Museum in Old Town San Diego State Historic Park in San Diego, California.[39]
Wells Fargo operates the Alaska Heritage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, which features a large collection of Alaskan Native artifacts, ivory carvings and baskets, fine art by Alaskan artists, and displays about Wells Fargo history in the Alaskan Gold Rush era.[40]

Wachovia acquisition[edit]




A former Wachovia branch converted to Wells Fargo in the fall of 2011 in Durham, North Carolina.


On October 3, 2008, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8 billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to have Citigroup buy Wachovia for $2.1 billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.[56]
On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the situation was sorted out.[57] Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court.[58] Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of $60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.[59]
Investment by U.S. Treasury during 2008 financial crisis[edit]
On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo was the recipient of $25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the US Treasury.[60][61] Tests by the Federal government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional $13.7 billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009 Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009 raising $8.6 billion in capital. The remaining $4.9 billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the $25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of $131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to $1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.[62]
History of Wells Fargo Securities[edit]
Wells Fargo Securities was established in 2009 to house Wells Fargo's capital markets group which it obtained during the Wachovia acquisition. Prior to that point, Wells Fargo had little to no participation in investment banking activities, though Wachovia had a well established investment banking practice which it operated under the Wachovia Securities banner.
Wachovia's institutional capital markets and investment banking business arose from the merger of Wachovia and First Union. First Union had bought Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. on April 30, 1998 adding to its merger and acquisition, high yield, leveraged finance, equity underwriting, private placement, loan syndication, risk management, and public finance capabilities.[63]
Legacy components of Wells Fargo Securities include Wachovia Securities, Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co., Barrington Associates, Halsey, Stuart & Co., Leopold Cahn & Co., Bache & Co.. Prudential Securities, A.G. Edwards, Inc. and the investment banking arm of Citadel LLC.[64]

Environmental record[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2009, Wells Fargo ranked #1 among banks and insurance companies, and #13 overall, in Newsweek Magazine’s inaugural "Green Rankings" of the country’s 500 largest companies.[66]
So far, Wells Fargo has provided more than $6 billion in financing for environmentally beneficial business opportunities, including supporting 185 commercial-scale solar photovoltaic projects and 27 utility-scale wind projects nationwide.[67]
As a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program, Wells Fargo aims to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its U.S. operations by 20% below 2008 levels by 2018.
Wells Fargo has launched what it believes to be the first blog among its industry peers to report on its environmental stewardship and to solicit feedback and ideas from its stakeholders.[68]

"We want to be as open and clear as possible about our environmental efforts – both our accomplishments and challenges – and share our experiences, ideas and thoughts as we work to integrate environmental responsibility into everything we do," said Mary Wenzel, director of Environmental Affairs. "We also want to hear and learn from our customers. By working together, we can do even more to protect and preserve natural resources for future generations."

Controversies[edit]




A Wells Fargo branch in Logan, Utah


Higher costs charged to African-American and Hispanic borrowers[edit]
Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Wells Fargo on July 31, 2009, alleging that the bank steers African Americans and Hispanics into high-cost subprime loans. A Wells Fargo spokesman responded that "The policies, systems, and controls we have in place – including in Illinois – ensure race is not a factor..."[69] According to Beth Jacobson, a loan officer at Wells Fargo interviewed for a report in The New York Times, "We just went right after them. Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans." The report goes on to present data from the city of Baltimore, where "more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods."[70]
Failure to monitor suspected money laundering[edit]
In a March 2010 agreement with federal prosecutors, Wells Fargo acknowledged that between 2004 and 2007 Wachovia had failed to monitor and report suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers, including the cash used to buy four planes that shipped a total of 22 tons of cocaine into Mexico.[71]
Overdraft fees[edit]
In August 2010, Wells Fargo was fined by U.S. District Judge William Alsup for overdraft practices designed to "gouge" consumers and "profiteer" at their expense, and for misleading consumers about how the bank processed transactions and assessed overdraft fees.[72][73][74]
Settlement and fines regarding mortgage servicing practices[edit]
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[75] The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[76] The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.
On April 5, 2012, a federal judge ordered Wells Fargo to pay $3.1 million in punitive damages over a single loan, one of the largest fines for a bank ever for mortgaging service misconduct.[77] Elizabeth Magner, a federal bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, cited the bank's behavior as "highly reprehensible",[78] stating that Wells Fargo has taken advantage of borrowers who rely on the bank's accurate calculations. She went on to add, "perhaps more disturbing is Wells Fargo's refusal to voluntarily correct its errors. It prefers to rely on the ignorance of borrowers or their inability to fund a challenge to its demands, rather than voluntarily relinquish gains obtained through improper accounting methods."[79]
Alleged racial discrimination during foreclosures[edit]
In 2011, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched an investigation of Wells Fargo for racial discrimination practices, the second federal probe in 2012 of alleged violations of misconduct with regard to race. The other, began in 2011 by the National Fair Housing Alliance has found "overwhelming" and "troubling" evidence that six of the nation's major banks handle foreclosures in neighborhoods populated primarily by minorities differently than in white communities.[80]
On July 13, 2012, Wells Fargo entered a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice for allegedly discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers from 2004 to 2009. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $125 million to subprime borrowers and $50 million in direct down payment assistance in certain areas, for a total of $175 million.[81][82] Wells Fargo spokespersons denied all claims and are settling only to avoid contested litigation.[82][83]
SEC fine due to inadequate risk disclosures[edit]
On August 14, 2012, Wells Fargo agreed to pay around $6.5 million to settle SEC charges that in 2007 it sold risky mortgage-backed securities without fully realizing their dangers.[84][85]
Lawsuit by FHA over loan underwriting[edit]
On October 9, 2012, the U.S. federal government sued the bank under the False Claims Act at the federal court in Manhattan, New York. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo defrauded the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the past ten years, underwriting over 100,000 FHA backed loans when over half did not qualify for the program. This suit is the third allegation levied against Wells Fargo in 2012.[86]
In October 2012, Wells Fargo was sued by U.S. federal attorney Preet Bharara over questionable mortgage deals.[87]
Lawsuit due to premium inflation on forced place insurance[edit]
In April 2013, Wells Fargo settled a suit with 24,000 Florida homeowners alongside insurer QBE, in which Wells Fargo was accused of inflating premiums on forced-place insurance.[88]
Lawsuit regarding excessive overdraft fees[edit]
In May 2013, Wells Fargo paid $203 million to settle class-action litigation accusing the bank of imposing excessive overdraft fees on checking-account customers. Also in May, the New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a lawsuit against Wells Fargo over alleged violations of the national mortgage settlement, a $25 billion deal struck between 49 state attorneys and the five-largest mortgage servicers in the US. Schneidermann claimed Wells Fargo had violated rules over giving fair and timely serving.[28]
2015 Violation of New York credit card laws[edit]
In February 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $4 million for violations where an affiliate took interest in the homes of borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for the homeowners. This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a $2 million penalty with the other $2 million going towards restitution to customers.[89]
Executive compensation[edit]
With CEO John Stumpf being paid 473 times more than the median employee, Wells Fargo ranks number 33 among the S&P 500 companies for CEO–employee pay inequality. In October 2014, a Wells Fargo employee earning $15 per hour emailed the CEO – copying 200,000 other employees – asking that all employees be given a $10,000 per year raise taken from a portion of annual corporate profits to address wage stagnation and income inequality. After being contacted by the media, Wells Fargo responded that all employees receive "market competitive" pay and benefits significantly above federal minimums.[90][91]
Tax avoidance and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Wells Fargo for spending $11 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $681 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $49 billion, laying off 6,385 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 180% to $49.8 million in 2010 for its top five executives.[92] As of 2014 however, at an effective tax rate of 31.2% of its income, Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest payer of corporation tax in the U.S.[93]
Prison industry investment[edit]
Main article: Prison–industrial complex
The GEO Group, Inc., a multi-national provider of for-profit private prisons, received investments made by Wells Fargo mutual funds on behalf of clients, not investments made by Wells Fargo and Company, according to company statements.[94] By March 2012, its stake had grown to more than 4.4 million shares worth $86.7 million.[95] As of November, 2012, the latest SEC filings reveal that Wells Fargo has divested 33% of its dispositive holdings of GEO's stock, which reduces Wells Fargo's holdings to 4.98% of Geo Group's common stock. By reducing its holdings to less than 5%, Wells Fargo will no longer be required to disclose some financial dealings with GEO.[96]
While a coalition of organizations, National People's Action Campaign, have seen some success in pressuring Wells Fargo to divest from private prison companies like GEO Group, the company continues to make such investments.[97]
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fines[edit]
Main article: Wells Fargo account fraud scandal
In September 2016, Wells Fargo was issued a combined total of $185 million in fines for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, the largest in the agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency.[98] The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted.[99] Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package.[100][101] On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically.[102] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank,[103] S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable,[104] and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company.[105] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them.[106] The board chose to use a clawback clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.[106]
Racketeering lawsuit for mortgage appraisal overcharges[edit]
In November 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit in which the bank was accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans. While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners $95 to $125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged $50 or less. The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.[107]
Dakota Access Pipeline investment[edit]
Wells Fargo is a top investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota, a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline project in the United States. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its necessity, and potential impact on the environment.[108]
In February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo "in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its "creation of millions of bogus accounts." and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve "social responsibility." The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.[109]
Failure to comply with document security requirements[edit]
In December 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Wells Fargo $5.5 million for failing to store electronic documents in a "write once, read many" format, which makes it impossible to alter or destroy records after they are written.[110]
SEC settlement for insider trading case[edit]
In 2015, an analyst at Wells Fargo settled an insider trading case with the SEC. The former employee was charged with insider trading alongside an ex-Wells Fargo trader.[111] Sadis & Goldberg obtained a settlement that permitted the client to continue in securities industry, while neither admitting nor denying one charge of negligence-based § 17(a)(3) claim, and paying a $75,000 civil penalty[112]

BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS             CREDIT SUISSE                            NOMURA

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for
the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should
read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the
depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more complete
information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering. You may
get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and we
have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to you
is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having the
characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that condition is
not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and neither the
depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to deliver any
portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase, and there will
be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery. You have
requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in connection with
your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates described in this
information. This information is being provided to you for informative purposes
only in response to your specific request. The Underwriters described in this
information may from time to time perform investment banking services for, or
solicit investment banking business from, any company named in this information.
The Underwriters and/or their employees may from time to time have a long or
short position in any contract or certificate discussed in this information. The
information contained herein supersedes any previous such information delivered
to you and may be superseded by information delivered to you prior to the time
of sale. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your
employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local
income "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are
provided to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment or tax
structure of the transaction.

TRANSACTION STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRANSACTION TERMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: CAPITALIZED TERMS USED BUT NOT OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE
     MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO THEM IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT DATED MAY 7, 2006.

ISSUE TYPE      Sequential pay REMIC. Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class
                A-PB, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-1A, Class A-M, Class A-J,
                Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E and Class F Certificates (the
                "Offered Certificates") are offered publicly. All other
                Certificates will be privately placed to qualified institutional
                buyers or to institutional accredited investors.

CUT-OFF DATE    All Mortgage Loan characteristics are based on balances as of
                the Cut-Off Date, which is May 11, 2006, with respect to 136
                Mortgage Loans, May 1, 2006, with respect to 11 Mortgage Loans,
                May 5, 2006, with respect to 4 Mortgage Loans and May 6, 2006,
                with respect to 1 Mortgage Loan. All percentages presented
                herein are approximate.

MORTGAGE POOL   The Mortgage Pool consists of 152 Mortgage Loans (the "Mortgage
                Loans") with an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-Off
                Date of $2,862,422,428 (the "Cut-Off Date Pool Balance"),
                subject to a variance of plus or minus 5%. The Mortgage Loans
                are secured by 173 properties (the "Mortgaged Properties")
                located throughout 34 states. The Mortgage Pool will be deemed
                to consist of 2 loan groups ("Loan Group 1" and "Loan Group 2"
                and together, the "Loan Groups"). Loan Group 1 will consist of
                (i) all of the Mortgage Loans that are not secured by Mortgaged
                Properties that are multifamily properties and mobile home park
                properties and (ii) 1 Mortgage Loan that is secured by a mobile
                home park property. Loan Group 1 is expected to consist of 117
                Mortgage Loans, with an aggregate principal balance as of the
                Cut-Off Date of $2,474,194,093 (the "Cut-Off Date Group 1
                Balance"). Loan Group 2 will consist of 33 Mortgage Loans that
                are secured by multifamily properties and 2 Mortgage Loans that
                are secured by mobile home park properties, with an aggregate
                principal balance as of the Cut-Off Date of $388,228,335 (the
                "Cut-Off Date Group 2 Balance" and, together with the Cut-Off
                Date Group 1 Balance, the "Cut-Off Date Pool Balance").

TRANSACTION TERMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREPAYMENT PREMIUMS     Any Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges
  AND YIELD MAINTENANCE actually collected on a Mortgage Loan during the related
  CHARGES               collection period in which the prepayment occurred will
                        be distributed to Certificateholders on the related
                        Distribution Date following the collection period in
                        which the prepayment occurred. Generally, the Class A-1,
                        Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-PB, Class A-4 and Class
                        A-5 Certificates will only be entitled to receive
                        distributions of Prepayment Premiums or Yield
                        Maintenance Charges in respect of Mortgage Loans in Loan
                        Group 1 until the Certificate Balance of the Class A-1A
                        Certificates has been reduced to zero, and the Class
                        A-1A Certificates will only be entitled to receive
                        distributions of Prepayment Premiums or Yield
                        Maintenance Charges in respect of Mortgage Loans in Loan
                        Group 2 until the Certificate Balance of the Class A-5
                        Certificates has been reduced to zero. On each
                        Distribution Date, the holders of each Class of Offered
                        Certificates and the Class G, Class H, Class J and Class
                        K Certificates then entitled to principal distributions
                        will be entitled to a portion of Prepayment Premiums or
                        Yield Maintenance Charges equal to the product of (a)
                        the amount of such Prepayment Premiums or Yield
                        Maintenance Charges, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the
                        numerator of which is equal to the excess, if any, of
                        the Pass-Through Rate of such Class of Certificates over
                        the relevant Discount Rate, and the denominator of which
                        is equal to the excess, if any, of the Mortgage Rate of
                        the prepaid Mortgage Loan over the relevant Discount
                        Rate, multiplied by (c) a fraction, the numerator of
                        which is equal to the amount of principal distributable
                        on such Class of Certificates on such Distribution Date,
                        and the denominator of which is the Principal
                        Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date.

                        The portion, if any, of the Prepayment Premiums or
                        Yield Maintenance Charges remaining after
                        any payments described above will be distributed to the
                        holders of the Class IO Certificates.

ADVANCES                The Master Servicer, and if the Master Servicer fails to
                        do so, the Trustee, will be obligated to make P&I
                        Advances and Servicing Advances, including delinquent
                        property taxes and insurance, on the Mortgage Loans but
                        only to the extent that such Advances are not deemed
                        non-recoverable and, in the case of P&I Advances,
                        subject to any Appraisal Reductions that may occur.

APPRAISAL REDUCTIONS    An appraisal reduction generally will be created in the
                        amount, if any, by which the principal balance of a
                        Required Appraisal Loan (plus other amounts overdue or
                        advanced in connection with such loan) exceeds 90% of
                        the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property
                        plus all escrows and reserves (including letters of
                        credit) held with respect to the Mortgage Loan. As a
                        result of calculating an Appraisal Reduction Amount for
                        a given Mortgage Loan, the P&I Advance for such loan
                        will be reduced, which will have the effect of reducing
                        the amount of interest available for distribution to the
                        Subordinate Certificates in reverse order of priority of
                        the Classes. An Appraisal Reduction will be reduced to
                        zero as of the date the related Mortgage Loan has been
                        brought current for at least three consecutive months,
                        paid in full, liquidated, repurchased or otherwise
                        disposed.

                      original Certificate Balance; provided, however, that if
                      no Class of Sequential Pay Certificates satisfies clause
                      (b) above, the Controlling Class shall be the outstanding
                      Class of Sequential Pay Certificates bearing the latest
                      alphabetical Class designation.

                      exercise some or all of the rights of the Controlling
                      Class and the Controlling Class Representative. See
                      "SERVICING OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS--The Controlling Class
                      Representative" in the Prospectus Supplement for more
                      information.

                      eligible.

SMMEA                 The Offered Certificates are not expected to be
                      "mortgage-related securities" for the purposes of
                      SMMEA.

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for
the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should
read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the
depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more complete
information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering. You may
get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at

prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and we
have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to you
is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having the
characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that condition is
not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and neither the
depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to deliver any
portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase, and there will
be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery. You have
requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in connection with
your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates described in this
information. This information is being provided to you for informative purposes
only in response to your specific request. The Underwriters described in this
information may from time to time perform investment banking services for, or
solicit investment banking business from, any company named in this information.
The Underwriters and/or their employees may from time to time have a long or
short position in any contract or certificate discussed in this information. The
information contained herein supersedes any previous such information delivered
to you and may be superseded by information delivered to you prior to the time
of sale. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your
employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local
income "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are
provided to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment or tax

(1)   Because this table presents information relating to the Mortgaged
      Properties and not the Mortgage Loans, the information for Mortgage Loans
      secured by more than one Mortgaged Property is based on allocated amounts
      (allocating the Mortgage Loan principal balance to each of those
      properties by the appraised values of the Mortgaged Properties or the
      allocated loan amount (or specific release prices) as described in the
      related Mortgage Loan documents).

(2)   For purposes of determining the DSC ratio for 1 Mortgage Loan (loan
      number 24), representing 1.0% of the Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (1.1% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance), such ratio was adjusted by taking into
      account amounts available under certain letters of credit and/or in cash
      reserves.

(3)   For purposes of determining the LTV ratios for 6 Mortgage Loans (loan
      numbers 3, 32, 36, 63, 89 and 96), representing approximately 8.4% of the
      Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (5 Mortgage Loans in Loan Group 1 or 9.5% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance and 1 Mortgage Loan in Loan Group 2 or
      1.7% of the Cut-Off Date Group 2 Balance), such ratios were calculated
      using "as stabilized" appraised values as opposed to "as is" appraised
      values.

(4)   A Mortgaged Property is classified as shadow anchored if it is located in
      close proximity to an anchored retail property.

The sum of aggregate percentage calculations may not equal 100% due to rounding.

treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

o     THE MORTGAGED PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN 34 STATES.

(1)   Because this table presents information relating to the Mortgaged
      Properties and not the Mortgage Loans, the information for Mortgage Loans
      secured by more than one Mortgaged Property is based on allocated amounts
      (allocating the Mortgage Loan principal balance to each of those
      properties by the appraised values of the Mortgaged Properties or the
      allocated loan amount (or specific release prices) as described in the
      related Mortgage Loan documents).

(2)   For purposes of determining the DSC ratio for 1 Mortgage Loan (loan
      number 24), representing 1.0% of the Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (1.1% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance), such ratio was adjusted by taking into
      account amounts available under certain letters of credit and/or in cash
      reserves.

(3)   For purposes of determining the LTV ratios for 6 Mortgage Loans (loan
      numbers 3, 32, 36, 63, 89 and 96), representing approximately 8.4% of the
      Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (5 Mortgage Loans in Loan Group 1 or 9.5% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance and 1 Mortgage Loan in Loan Group 2 or
      1.7% of the Cut-Off Date Group 2 Balance), such ratios were calculated
      using "as stabilized" appraised values as opposed to "as is" appraised
      values.

(4)   For purposes of determining whether a Mortgaged Property is in Northern
      California or Southern California, Mortgaged Properties north of San Luis
      Obispo County, Kern County and San Bernardino County were included in
      Northern California and Mortgaged Properties south of or included in such
      counties were included in Southern California.

The sum of aggregate percentage calculations may not equal 100% due to rounding.

(1)   For purposes of determining the DSC ratio for 1 Mortgage Loan (loan
      number 24), representing 1.0% of the Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (1.1% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance), such ratio was adjusted by taking into
      account amounts available under certain letters of credit and/or in cash
      reserves.

(2)   For purposes of determining the LTV ratios for 6 Mortgage Loans (loan
      numbers 3, 32, 36, 63, 89 and 96), representing approximately 8.4% of the
      Cut-Off Date Pool Balance (5 Mortgage Loans in Loan Group 1 or 9.5% of
      the Cut-Off Date Group 1 Balance and 1 Mortgage Loan in Loan Group 2 or
      1.7% of the Cut-Off Date Group 2 Balance), such ratios were calculated
      using "as stabilized" appraised values as opposed to "as is" appraised
      values.

condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,

(1)   The Prime Outlets Pool Loan is part of a split loan structure that
      includes a pari passu companion loan that is not included in the Trust
      Fund. With respect to this Mortgage Loan, unless otherwise specified, the
      calculations of LTV ratios, DSC ratios and loan balance per square
      foot/unit/room are based on the aggregate indebtedness of or debt service
      on, as applicable, the mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion
      loan.
(2)   For purposes of determining the LTV ratio for 1 mortgage loan (loan
      number 3), representing 6.1% of the mortgage pool (7.1% of loan group 1),
      such ratio was calculated using an "as stabilized" appraised value (as
      defined in the appraisal) as opposed to "as is" appraised value.

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to

identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

This material is for your private information, and none of Wachovia Capital
Markets, LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott & Stringfellow, Inc.,
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or Nomura Securities International, Inc.
(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

                               PRIME OUTLETS POOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    THE LOAN. The Mortgage Loan (the "Prime Outlets Pool Loan") is secured by
     first mortgages or deeds of trust encumbering 10 retail outlet centers
     located in various locations throughout the United States. The Prime
     Outlets Pool Loan represents approximately 11.0% of the Cut-Off Date Pool
     Balance. The Prime Outlets Pool Loan was originated on January 9, 2006 and
     has an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-Off Date of $315,340,000.
     The Prime Outlets Pool Loan, which is evidenced by a pari passu note dated
     January 9, 2006, is a portion of a whole loan with an original principal
     balance of $630,680,000. The other loan related to the Prime Outlets Pool
     Loan is evidenced by a separate note, dated January 9, 2006 (the "Prime
     Outlets Pool Pari Passu Companion Loan"), with an original principal
     balance of $315,340,000. The Prime Outlets Pool Pari Passu Companion Loan
     will not be an asset of the Trust Fund. The Prime Outlets Pool Pari Passu
     Companion Loan and the Prime Outlets Pool Loan are governed by an
     intercreditor and servicing agreement and will be serviced pursuant to the
     terms of the pooling and servicing agreement relating to the Wachovia Bank
     Commercial Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
     Series 2006-C23 transaction, as described in the Prospectus Supplement
     under "DESCRIPTION OF THE MORTGAGE POOL--Co-Lender Loans". The Prime
     Outlets Pool Loan provides for interest-only payments for the first 24
     months of its term, and thereafter, fixed monthly payments of principal and
     interest.

     The Prime Outlets Pool Loan has a remaining term of 116 months and matures
     on January 11, 2016. The Prime Outlets Pool Loan may be prepaid on or after
     November 11, 2015, and permits defeasance with United States government
     obligations beginning two years after the Closing Date.

o    THE BORROWERS. The borrowers consist of 10 limited partnerships and 1
     limited liability company, each a special purpose entity. Legal counsel to
     the borrowers delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the
     origination of the Prime Outlets Pool Loan. The sponsor of the borrowers is
     David Lichtenstein. Mr. Lichtenstein has built a portfolio of 20,000
     apartment units and 27 million square feet of commercial and retail space
     in 28 states over the past 17 years as President and Founder of The
     Lightstone Group.

o    THE PROPERTIES. The Mortgaged Properties consist of 10 Prime Retail Outlet
     Centers located throughout the United States. As of November 28, 2005, the
     occupancy rate for the Mortgaged Properties securing the Prime Outlets Pool
     Loan was approximately 89.0%.

o    RELEASE. The borrower may obtain the release of a certain portion of the
     Pleasant Prairie Mortgaged Property in connection with such portion being
     reconfigured in conjunction with the planned construction of a food court.
     In connection with such free release, the borrower is required to deposit
     $5,000,000 into a reconfiguration reserve to be held by the mortgagee until
     such time as the allocated DSC ratio equals at least 1.20x and the LTV
     ratio equals no more than 80% with respect to the Pleasant Prairie
     Mortgaged Property and the DSC ratio with respect to the Prime Outlets Pool
     Loan is 1.30x or greater.

o    LOCKBOX ACCOUNT. All tenant payments due under the applicable tenant leases
     are deposited into a mortgagee-designated lockbox account.

o    MANAGEMENT. Prime Retail, L.P., an affiliate of the sponsor, is the
     property manager for the Mortgaged Properties securing the Prime Outlets
     Pool Loan.

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury

(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more

prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded

anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The

prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in

anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury

to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item

o    THE LOAN. The Mortgage Loan (the "Westfield Gateway Loan") is secured by a
     first mortgage encumbering a regional mall located in Lincoln, Nebraska.

     payments for the entire loan term.

     The Westfield Gateway Loan is expected to have a remaining term of 120
     months and will mature on May 11, 2016. At the borrower's election, the
     Westfield Gateway Loan may be prepaid with payment of a yield maintenance

     Younkers is a regional department store chain owned by Bon-Ton Stores, Inc
     ("Bon-Ton"). As of May 2, 2006, Bon-Ton was rated "B+" (S&P), "B2"
     (Moody's) and "CCC" (Fitch). The Younkers lease expires in December 2010.

     15.4% of the net rentable area. Steve & Barry's currently operates over 130
     casual and collegiate stores across the United States offering a wide
     selection of clothing for men, women and children. The Steve & Barry's
     lease expires in January 2011. The third largest tenant is Circuit City
     Stores, Inc. ("Circuit City"), occupying approximately 32,545 square feet,
     or approximately 6.3% of the net rentable area. Circuit City is a

o    THE LOAN. The Mortgage Loan (the "Hercules Plaza Loan") is secured by a
     first leasehold mortgage in an office building located in Wilmington,
     Delaware. The Hercules Plaza Loan represents approximately 2.7% of the
     Cut-Off Date Pool Balance. The Hercules Plaza Loan was originated on March
31, 2006, and has a principal balance as of the Cut-Off Date of
     $77,892,043. The Hercules Plaza Loan, which is evidenced by a senior note,
     dated March 31, 2006, is the senior portion of a whole loan with an
     original principal balance of $98,000,000. The companion loan related to
     the Hercules Plaza Loan is evidenced by a separate subordinate note, dated
     March 31, 2006, with a principal balance as of the Cut-Off Date of
     $19,993,033 (the "Hercules Plaza Companion Loan"). The Hercules Plaza
     Companion Loan will not be an asset of the Trust Fund. The Hercules Plaza
     Loan and the Hercules Plaza Companion Loan will be governed by an
     intercreditor and servicing agreement, as described in the Prospectus
     Supplement under "DESCRIPTION OF THE MORTGAGE POOL--Co-Lender Loans" and
     will be serviced pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement.

     The Hercules Plaza Loan has a remaining term of 119 months and matures on
     April 11, 2016. The Hercules Plaza Loan may be prepaid on or after March
11, 2016, and permits defeasance with United States government obligations
     beginning two years after the Closing Date.

o    THE BORROWER. The borrower is D.C.L. Leasing Partners Limited Partnership,
     Ltd. -- VI, a special purpose entity. Legal counsel to the borrower
     delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of
     the Hercules Plaza Loan. The sponsor is McConnell Johnson Real Estate, a
     Wilmington-based development, leasing and property management firm, which
     also owns 1201 North Market Street located directly across the street from
     the Mortgaged Property.

o    THE PROPERTY. The Mortgaged Property is an approximately 518,409 square
     foot office building situated on approximately 2.0 acres. The Mortgaged
     Property was constructed in 1982 as the corporate headquarters building for
     Hercules Incorporated ("Hercules"). The Mortgaged Property is located in
     Wilmington, Delaware.

     As of February 2, 2006, the Mortgaged Property securing the Hercules Plaza
     Loan was 100.0% leased pursuant to a master lease to Hercules Incorporated
     ("Hercules"), under the original 30-year lease. The Hercules lease expires
     in May 2013, and contains five 5-year renewal options. Hercules
     manufactures specialty chemicals used in the pulp manufacturing, petroleum
     refining, food processing, paint manufacturing, construction materials,
     adhesives, pharmaceutical and personal care markets. As of April 26, 2006,
     Hercules was rated "BB" (S&P) and "Ba2" (Moody's). While Hercules leases
     the entire building, Hercules is only in physical occupancy of
     approximately 155,000 square feet, or approximately 29.9% of the net
     rentable area. Hercules subleases approximately 290,000 square feet, or
     approximately 55.9% of the net rentable area to outside tenants.

o    LOCKBOX. All tenant payments due under the applicable lease are deposited
     into a mortgagee-designated lockbox account.

o    MANAGEMENT. McConnell Johnson Real Estate Company LLC ("McConnell
     Johnson"), an affiliate of the sponsor, is the property manger for the
     Mortgaged Property securing the Hercules Plaza Loan. McConnell Johnson owns
     and manages commercial properties, including office, warehouse,
     distribution and manufacturing, leased to high credit quality tenants, and
     to date has developed in excess of 100 properties.

being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more

being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and

of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to

neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment
or tax structure of the transaction.

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax

to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax

treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,

material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at

prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for

Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform
investment banking services for, or solicit investment banking business from,
any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for

any company named in this information. The Underwriters and/or their employees
may from time to time have a long or short position in any contract or
certificate discussed in this information. The information contained herein
supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at

participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,

material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at

the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by

of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that

neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

(collectively, the "Underwriters") is soliciting any action based upon it. This
material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the depositor, any Underwriter or any dealer
participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus after
filing if you request it by calling toll free 1-800-745-2063 (8am-5pm EST). The
certificates referred to in these materials, and the asset pools backing them,
are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.
You have requested that the Underwriters provide to you information in
connection with your consideration of the purchase of certain certificates
described in this information. This information is being provided to you for
informative purposes only in response to your specific request. The
Underwriters described in this information may from time to time perform

supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded

anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,

limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions

material is not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any
offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or
solicitation would be illegal. The depositor has filed a registration statement
(including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you
should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents
the depositor has filed with the SEC (SEC File No. 333-131262) for more
complete information about the depositor, the issuing trust and this offering.
You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at

are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or
more classes of certificates may be split, combined or eliminated at any time
prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering
the purchase of these offered certificates, a contract of sale will come into
being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and
we have confirmed the allocation of certificates to be made to you; any
"indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated by
us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us. As a result
of the foregoing, you may commit to purchase offered certificates that have
characteristics that may change, and you are advised that all or a portion of
the offered certificates may not be issued that have the characteristics
described in these materials. Our obligation to sell offered certificates to
you is conditioned on the offered certificates that are actually issued having
the characteristics described in these materials. If we determine that
condition is not satisfied in any material respect, we will notify you, and
neither the depositor nor any Underwriter will have any obligation to you to
deliver any portion of the certificates which you have committed to purchase,
and there will be no liability between us as a consequence of the non-delivery.

described in this information. This information is being provided to you for

supersedes any previous such information delivered to you and may be superseded
by information delivered to you prior to the time of sale. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, you (and each of your employees,
representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the United States federal, state and local income "tax
treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4) and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) of the transaction contemplated hereby that are provided
to you (or your representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure, other than the name of the issuer or information that would permit
identification of the issuer, and except that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other information,
this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the United States federal, state and local income tax treatment

   upon a Mortgage Loan default with respect to any of these Mortgage Loans. The
   Certificateholders will not have any right to participate in or control any
   such determination. No other Mortgage Loans are subject to
   cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.
