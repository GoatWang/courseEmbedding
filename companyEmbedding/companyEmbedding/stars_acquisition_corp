(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be     
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                 

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the 
    private units.                                                               

(3) The deferred underwriting discounts and commissions in an amount of 2.5% of  
    the gross proceeds raised in this offering will be payable to the            
    underwriters upon the consummation of our initial business combination and   
    will be held in the trust account until the consummation of such initial     
    business combination.                                                        

(4) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our    
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including  
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital   
    Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised 
    in the offering described below.    

(5) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at 
    approximately $700,000 even if the over-allotment option is exercised. In    
    addition, interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account    
    (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) will be available to 
    us to pay for our working capital requirements. We estimate the interest 
    earned on the trust account will be approximately $60,000 over a 18-month 
    period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.1% per year.                    

(6) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination  based upon the level of complexity of that business 
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our 
    intended use of proceeds.     

Wai Fun Cheng, Ren Hua Zheng and Ying Chenand Chardan Capital Markets, LLC have
committed that they will purchase the private units (for an aggregate purchase
price of $3,200,000) from us on a private placement basis that will occur
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. They have also agreed
that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, they (and/or their designees) will purchase from us at a price of $10.00
per unit the number of private units (up to a maximum of 30,000 private units)
that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to $10.20 per
share of common stock sold to the public in this offering. All of the proceeds
we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$40,800,000, or $46,920,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase., maintained
by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. The funds held in
the trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to (1) interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations
and (2) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us for our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our
initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public
shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time
period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to
pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business
combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to
finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other
similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders, members of our management
team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Since the role of present management after our initial
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $700,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be
released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for our
initial business combination. We intend to use the after-tax interest earned for
miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business and for director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions payable to Chardan Capital
Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in
the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination. To the
extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to
effect our initial business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account
which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, Wai Fun Cheng, Ren Hua Zheng, Richard Xu and Tom
W. Su have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation
(currently anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek
repayment of such expenses.

As of May 31, 2017, Ren Hua Zheng, our director, loaned us $175,000 to repay the
then outstanding $175,000 loan, which had been used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. This
resulted in our having actual liabilities of $350,000 as of May 31, 2017. The
prior note was repaid on June 1, 2017. The loans are payable without interest on
the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 18 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to
so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business
combination. If we do not complete a business combination, any loans and
advances from our insiders, officers and directors or their affiliates, will be
repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with
utilizing the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in
completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be
limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business 
  combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a 
  transaction;      

• our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public  
  stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
  combination;                                        

• our outstanding rights and unit purchase options, and the potential future 
  dilution they represent;                              

• our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to
  Chardan Capital Markets, LLC upon consummation of our initial business     
  combination;                                     

• our obligation to either repay working capital loans that may be made to us by
  our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates;  

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the  
  private units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our       
  insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working  
  capital loans; and                                       

• the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities  
  under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us 
  prior to the consummation of a business combination.                 

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however,
that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States
public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held
entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an
initial business combination with a target business with significant growth
potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in
all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business.
Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or
ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on
May 19, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar business combination, which we refer to


 throughout this prospectus
as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses or entities,
which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a target business. To date, our
efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities
related to this offering. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business
will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we
intend to focus our search on target businesses being operated by and/or serving
ethnic minorities in the United States, especially within Asian-American
communities. We have not selected any target business for our initial business
combination and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or
indirectly, engaged in any substantive discussions with a target business with
respect to a business combination transaction with us.

SRS Acquisition Corporation



Private
Building Materials
500 - 1,000 Employees
Headquartered in McKinney, TX






SRS Acquisition Corporation (dba SRS Roofing Supply) consists of a family of industry-leading independent roofing distributors that share a common goal and purpose - to focus all of our efforts on serving the professional roofing contractor. SRS is a private company sponsored by AEA investors and lead by a management team of industry veterans who understand the needs of the professional contractor. We have grown rapidly through acquisition and the opening of multiple new locations since our February, 2008 inception as more fully detailed in "Our History". With this aggressive growth in a down market, SRS has established itself as one of the fastest growing building products distribution companies in the U.S.

The goal of SRS is to form the strongest national network of independent roofing distributors with the most talented team of people working together to deliver the industry's best products and services. In addition to our customer focus, SRS strives to become the preferred employer in the industry with highly motivated and engaged employees operating in an entrepreneurial culture where the corporate office works for the field and not the reverse. SRS also aims to become the most attractive distribution partner to our many valued suppliers by forming collaborative relationships built on trust and friendship that date back many decades.

SRS enjoys strong investor and banking relationships and has a strong balance sheet to enable us to be a high-growth company in the years ahead. We have a very narrow product focus with roofing making up almost 95% of our sales, allowing us to enjoy a broader and deeper inventory of roofing products at each location than many of our competitors. We have the delivery capabilities and equipment to deliver any product you need, where you want it, when you need it.






Core values

At SRS, our core values center on respect for all individuals, stewardship and a love for the roofing distribution industry.

Our values include:

Helping our customers, employees and suppliers grow


An entrepreneurial environment where the local manager runs his/her own business catered to their market and their unique customer needs.


Being great stewards of our investor's capital


Doing things with character and integrity as a responsible industry participant


A culture that makes having fun a priority







Suppliers

At SRS Acquisition we have very special relationships with our supplier partners that have been built on decades of personal relationships while working together to collectively grow our businesses.

Our preferred vendor partners listed below are the best of the best in the industry and we are proud to distribute their products to you, our valued customer.
