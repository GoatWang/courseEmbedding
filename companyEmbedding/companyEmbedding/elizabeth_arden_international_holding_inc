Anderson Holdings have an option to acquire the remaining interest in Red Door Spa Holdings. The investment will be recorded as a minority investment by the Company and, therefore, it will not have a material impact on the Company's financial results. E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Elizabeth Arden, Inc., commented, "Our intent in partnering with John Anderson and North Castle Partners is to accelerate the growth of the spa business in parallel with the growth of the Elizabeth Arden brand and the Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning. The collaboration between Elizabeth Arden, Inc., John Anderson and North Castle brings the relevant product, operational management and financial skills to maximize the growth potential and profitability of the Red Door Spa business. The equity of the Elizabeth Arden brand is rooted in its Red Door Spa heritage. We intend to leverage this unique association to drive both Elizabeth Arden product sales and the Red Door Spa business." Mr. Anderson continued, "I am extremely excited about the potential of Red Door Spas. The Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa enjoys tremendous brand equity. As one of the most highly recognized names in the nearly $50 billion global spa industry, I look forward to leveraging this brand name in expanding the business."Alison Minter, North Castle Partners Managing Director, stated, "We believe the opportunity to align our economic interests and to leverage Elizabeth Arden, Inc's. corporate resources and marketing capabilities, particularly in expanding product sales, will strengthen Red Door Spa Holdings' leadership position in the day spa market. This transaction is another example of North Castle partnering with management teams to build high quality brands that are of strategic value to leading consumer product companies."Red Door Spa Holdings currently owns and operates 31 Red Door Spas in freestanding locations and upscale resort and hotel properties in the United States and 18 Mario Tricoci Hair Salons in the Chicago metro area and had combined revenue of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2011.Mr. Anderson has been a developer, owner, and manager of hotel and resort projects. Mr. Anderson's experience also includes spa development, management and consulting. Mr. Anderson has been involved in various hotel and spa properties, including the Hyatt Regency Pier 66, Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa, Sonoma, California. Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa was a pioneer in resort spas and one with a significant salon presence. A joint venture managed by Mr. Anderson created the first Ritz-Carlton Spa in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which also had a significant salon presence, under the brand name SonomaTherapy™ Spa. This spa consistently performed as one of the best spas at Ritz-Carlton properties, ranking in the upper quartile for all Ritz spas. Mr. Anderson has also provided consulting services to other hotel and resort companies, including Swissotel, Grupo Huarte, and Host Hotels.Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an extensive portfolio of prestige beauty brands sold in over 120 countries. The company's brand portfolio includes Elizabeth Arden skincare, color and fragrance products, the celebrity fragrance brands of Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Taylor Swift, and Usher; the designer fragrance brands of Juicy Couture, Alfred Sung, BCBGMAXAZRIA, Geoffrey Beene, Halston, Bob Mackie, Ed Hardy, John Varvatos, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand, True Religion and Rocawear; and the lifestyle fragrance brands Curve, Giorgio Beverly Hills, and PS Fine Cologne.North Castle Partners is a leading private equity firm focused on investments in consumer product and service businesses that promote Health, Wellness, and Active Living.

Elizabeth Arden, Inc. Announces Investment in Red Door Spa Holdings






NEW YORK, Sep 07, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE) --Elizabeth Arden, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDEN), a global prestige beauty products
company, today announced that it has made an investment in Red Door Spa
Holdings, the operator of the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spas and the
Mario Tricoci Hair Salons privately owned by North Castle Partners.

Elizabeth Arden, Inc. (“the Company”) licenses the trademarks for the Elizabeth
Arden and Red Door brand names to Red Door Spa Holdings, the
owner and operator of the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spas. Red Door Spa
Holdings is a privately-held company backed by North Castle Partners
(“North Castle”), a leading investor in small-cap consumer companies
focused on Health, Wellness and Active Living. Elizabeth Arden, Inc. has
partnered with J.H. Anderson Holdings, Inc. and its principal John
Anderson, to collectively invest $12 million for a minority interest in
Red Door Spa Holdings. In addition, Elizabeth Arden, Inc. and J.H.
Anderson Holdings have an option to acquire the remaining interest in
Red Door Spa Holdings. The investment will be recorded as a minority
investment by the Company and, therefore, it will not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial results.

E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Elizabeth Arden, Inc., commented, “Our intent in partnering with John
Anderson and North Castle Partners is to accelerate the growth of the
spa business in parallel with the growth of the Elizabeth Arden brand
and the Elizabeth Arden brand repositioning. The collaboration between
Elizabeth Arden, Inc., John Anderson and North Castle brings the
relevant product, operational management and financial skills to
maximize the growth potential and profitability of the Red Door Spa
business. The equity of the Elizabeth Arden brand is rooted in its Red
Door Spa heritage. We intend to leverage this unique association to
drive both Elizabeth Arden product sales and the Red Door Spa business.”

Mr. Anderson continued, “I am extremely excited about the potential of
Red Door Spas. The Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa enjoys tremendous brand
equity. As one of the most highly recognized names in the nearly $50
billion global spa industry, I look forward to leveraging this brand
name in expanding the business.”

Alison Minter, North Castle Partners Managing Director, stated, “We
believe the opportunity to align our economic interests and to leverage
Elizabeth Arden, Inc’s. corporate resources and marketing capabilities,
particularly in expanding product sales, will strengthen Red Door Spa
Holdings’ leadership position in the day spa market. This transaction is
another example of North Castle partnering with management teams to
build high quality brands that are of strategic value to leading
consumer product companies.”

Red Door Spa Holdings currently owns and operates 31 Red Door Spas in
freestanding locations and upscale resort and hotel properties in the
United States and 18 Mario Tricoci Hair Salons in the Chicago metro area
and had combined revenue of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2011.

Mr. Anderson has been a developer, owner, and manager of hotel and
resort projects. Mr. Anderson’s experience also includes spa
development, management and consulting. Mr. Anderson has been involved
in various hotel and spa properties, including the Hyatt Regency Pier
66, Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa, Sonoma,
California. Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa was a pioneer in resort spas and
one with a significant salon presence. A joint venture managed by Mr.
Anderson created the first Ritz-Carlton Spa in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
which also had a significant salon presence, under the brand name
SonomaTherapy™ Spa. This spa consistently performed as one of the best
spas at Ritz-Carlton properties, ranking in the upper quartile for all
Ritz spas. Mr. Anderson has also provided consulting services to other
hotel and resort companies, including Swissotel, Grupo Huarte, and Host
Hotels.

History[edit]
The company was founded as Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1971 for $38 million ($224,721,446 today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from Unilever in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed (NASDAQ: RDEN). The company is located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami.[4] The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.
Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were Vendela Kirsebom during the 1980s, Amber Valletta to the mid-1990s, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. On 2 December 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.[5]
Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to Britney Spears fragrances, as well as the Hilary Duff, Elizabeth Taylor and Mariah Carey fragrance collections. Juicy Couture's "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift's fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.[6]
In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on Pinterest, Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.
Sale to Revlon[edit]
In June 2016, US cosmetics company Revlon announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (£611m). When the deal is concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.[7]
On September 7, 2016, Revlon completed its acquisition of Elizabeth Arden. At the time of the merger, it was expected that E. Scott Beattie would join Revlon, Inc.’s board of directors as non-executive Vice Chairman and serve as a senior advisor to Fabian Garcia, Revlon’s President and Chief Executive Officer.[8] [9]
On November 3, 2016, Revlon’s Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Arden’s former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlon’s Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.[10]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1971 for $38 million ($224,721,446 today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from Unilever in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed (NASDAQ: RDEN). The company is located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami.[4] The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.
Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were Vendela Kirsebom during the 1980s, Amber Valletta to the mid-1990s, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. On 2 December 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.[5]
Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to Britney Spears fragrances, as well as the Hilary Duff, Elizabeth Taylor and Mariah Carey fragrance collections. Juicy Couture's "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift's fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.[6]
In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on Pinterest, Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.
Sale to Revlon[edit]
In June 2016, US cosmetics company Revlon announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (£611m). When the deal is concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.[7]
On September 7, 2016, Revlon completed its acquisition of Elizabeth Arden. At the time of the merger, it was expected that E. Scott Beattie would join Revlon, Inc.’s board of directors as non-executive Vice Chairman and serve as a senior advisor to Fabian Garcia, Revlon’s President and Chief Executive Officer.[8] [9]
On November 3, 2016, Revlon’s Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Arden’s former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlon’s Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.[10]
