Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 50%, and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the
Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as
anticipated.

The net proceed will be used :

Except for fixed costs, the amounts actually spent by us for any specific
purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors. Non-fixed cost, sales
and marketing and general and administrative costs may vary depending on the
business progress and development efforts, general business conditions and
market reception to our services. Accordingly, our management has broad
discretion to allocate the net proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending allocation for non-fixed costs include
Management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing. Such changes to spending may occur due to seasonal
variations in market demand for our services relative to when the funds are
received.

If necessary, Jevgeni Karamkov, our sole officer and director, has verbally
agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we
will require full funding to implement our complete business plan.


There are thousands of event promoters of different popularity who compete
directly with us. Some of these competitors have established businesses with
substantial following and valuable contacts. We will attempt to compete against
these groups by establishing networks of promoters who will keep, on a regular
basis, personal contact with our clientele. We cannot assure you that such a
marketing plan will be successful or that competitors will not copy our business
strategy.

Our inability to achieve profit and revenue due to competition will have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 28, 2013. We are in the
business of event organization and promotion. To date, we have not yet generated
any revenue. To generate revenue at events, we will be pre-selling tickets to
customers via promoters, local stores and websites as well as


 charging an
entrance fee at the door for walk-in customers.

Promotion, as a general term, includes all the ways available to make a product
and/or service known to, and purchased by, customers and clients. To organize
our events, we plan to invite the DJ in demand at that particular time and make
sure the venue will be suitable for the expected amount of clients who will want
to attend. We plan to organize the events from start to finish by using existing
venues. We would also be open to help promoting other events if the profit
margins will be advantageous to our company.

Being a DJ himself, our president was involved in the organization of DJ events
for 10 years preceding the formation of our company. During his DJ career, he
developed valuable contacts in the Estonian entertainment and promotions
industry. Mr. Karamkov’s experience and contacts will be highly valuable to our
company and we intent to take advantage of his experience. Our business strategy
is to continue organizing DJ events in nightclubs. We also intend to begin
organizing live music concerts in Estonia.

Alternative form of revenue will require us to find sponsors, willing to
advertise their company at our events. Sponsors will pay a fee in return for
their product being advertised at our events. To attract prominent sponsors, our
events and brand must become popular with high numbers of attendance. We intend
to invite well-known DJs and live bands to perform at our events. Our costs will
increase every time we invite a more popular DJ. Not only the DJ will be more
expensive, but the promotion and advertisement of high quality DJs will be more
costly. Net profit, if any, will be the amount remaining after deducting the
costs of advertising the event and paying the performers.
