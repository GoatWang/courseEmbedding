  Gastrointestinal Animal Health Product Development | Jaguar Animal Health                     follow us:         About Us  About UsOur TeamBoard of Directors  ABOUT JAGUAR ANIMAL HEALTHJaguar Animal Health is a company focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class gastrointestinal products for companion animals, horses and production animals. Our products are designed with a thorough understanding of not only species-specific health issues, but also market practices, the economics of current treatment strategies, competitive dynamics, government initiatives, such as concerns about extensive antibiotic usage, and effective channels for new product introductions.In addition to Canalevia™ for dogs and Neonorm™ for foals and preweaned dairy and beef calves, we are developing formulations of these products across multiple animal species and market channels.Our management team has significant experience in gastrointestinal and animal health product development. This experience includes the development of crofelemer for human use, from discovery and preclinical and clinical toxicity studies, including the existing animal studies to be used for Canalevia™ regulatory approvals, through human clinical development.Our team also includes individuals who have prior animal health experience at major pharmaceutical companies, including Ciba-Geigy Corp., now Novartis International AG, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, now GlaxoSmithKline LLC, and the animal health group of Pfizer Inc., now Zoetis Inc.NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION (MOA)Our gastrointestinal products and product candidates act by normalizing the flow of ions and water in the intestinal lumen, the dysregulation of which is the last step common to the manifestation of watery diarrhea. As a result, we believe that our products and product candidates may be effective in addressing watery diarrhea, regardless of cause. In addition, the channels that regulate this ion and water flow, including channels known as CFTR and CaCC (the sites of action of our gastrointestinal products), are generally present in mammals. We therefore expect that the clinical benefit shown in humans and preweaned dairy calves will be confirmed in multiple other species. Accordingly, we believe we can bring to market multiple products for a range of species that are first-in-class and effective in preventing the debilitating and devastating ramifications of watery diarrhea in companion and production animals.The following diagram illustrates the mechanism of action of our gastrointestinal products and product candidates, which normalize chloride and water flow and transit time of fluids within the intestinal lumen.

Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. Key Developments

Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. Announce the Results of a Supplemental Analysis of the Long-Term Trial of crofelemer (Mytesi®) in Patients with Chronic HIV-Related Diarrhea
Jul 24 17
Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. announced the results of a supplemental analysis of the long-term trial of crofelemer (Mytesi®) in patients with chronic HIV-related diarrhea. The analysis revealed a mean decrease of over 70% in diarrhea episodes versus baseline and over 50% of patients with complete resolution of their diarrhea. The results were reported at the 9th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science on July 26, 2017 in Paris, France. Mytesi (crofelemer) is the only drug that has been specifically studied in and FDA-approved for use in managing diarrhea in people living with HIV. The safety and efficacy of crofelemer in reducing HIV-related diarrhea were assessed in the ADVENT trial. While the primary efficacy and safety results have previously been reported, this supplemental analysis was conducted to provide a more complete understanding of the long-term efficacy of crofelemer in patients with chronic HIV-related diarrhea. Prior to study entry, patients enrolled in the ADVENT trial had an average of 20 watery stools per week (approximately three per day). Key results of this analysis showed: An average reduction of 73% in diarrhea episodes by week 24 of crofelemer treatment; More than 75% of patients had a clinically meaningful reduction in diarrhea, as measured by at least a 50% decrease in the number of episodes; More than 50% of patients had a complete resolution of their diarrhea by week 24 of crofelemer treatment; There was no significant difference between patients who were taking a protease inhibitor and those who were not or based upon the cause of the diarrhea.

Merger Terms Include Funding for Combined Company and Other Aspects 
      of the Merger Disclosed in the Proxy/Prospectus


Jaguar to Host Conference Call Friday, July 28th at 8:30 a.m. Eastern 
      Time

      Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAGX) (Jaguar) and Napo 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Napo) announced that at separate special 
      stockholder meetings today the stockholders of both companies approved 
      proposals recommended by the Jaguar and Napo boards regarding the merger 
      of Jaguar and Napo.
    

      The merger transaction remains on track to become effective on Monday, 
      July 31, 2017, at which point Jaguar’s name will be changed to Jaguar 
      Health, Inc., and Napo will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
      Jaguar focused on human health and the ongoing commercialization of 
      Mytesi®, which is approved by the U.S. FDA for the 
      symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on 
      antiretroviral therapy. As previously announced, the terms of the merger 
      include funding for the combined company and for other aspects of the 
      merger as disclosed in the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus.
    

      “Today’s votes represent a pivotal development in the evolution of both 
      companies. It is truly transformational for Jaguar Health to 
      forward-integrate into an important revenue stream from Mytesi®, 
      for which the company will hold unencumbered global rights and is 
      pursuing multiple follow-on indications for various chronic 
      gastrointestinal disorders. This merger speaks to the shared vision and 
      persistence of the dedicated and talented team members at both Jaguar 
      and Napo—some of whom have worked for more than 20 years to change the 
      standard of care for gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals,” 
      stated Lisa Conte, Jaguar's president and CEO and Napo’s interim CEO. 
      “We are grateful for the continued enthusiasm and support for this 
      merger, and we remain excited about the opportunity we believe this 
      combination will create for our stockholders as well as Mytesi® 
      patients and animals.”

About Mytesi®


      Mytesi® (crofelemer) is an antidiarrheal indicated for the 
      symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patients with 
      HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mytesi® is not 
      indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. Rule out infectious 
      etiologies of diarrhea before starting Mytesi®. If infectious 
      etiologies are not considered, there is a risk that patients with 
      infectious etiologies will not receive the appropriate therapy and their 
      disease may worsen. In clinical studies, the most common adverse 
      reactions occurring at a rate greater than placebo were upper 
      respiratory tract infection (5.7%), bronchitis (3.9%), cough (3.5%), 
      flatulence (3.1%), and increased bilirubin (3.1%).
    

      More information and complete Prescribing Information are available at Mytesi.com. 
      Crofelemer, the active ingredient in Mytesi®, is a botanical 
      (plant-based) drug extracted and purified from the red bark sap of the 
      medicinal Croton lechleri tree in the Amazon rainforest. Napo has 
      established a sustainable harvesting program for crofelemer to ensure a 
      high degree of quality and ecological integrity.

Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. Launches First Product, Neonorm™ Calf, at World Dairy Expo | Business Wire


























































Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. Launches First Product, Neonorm™ Calf, at 
      World Dairy Expo




ANIMART Named First Commercial Partner






September 29, 2014 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. (“Jaguar”), an animal health company 
      focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class 
      gastrointestinal products for companion and production animals, 
      announced the planned launch of its first commercial product, Neonorm™ 
      Calf, at the upcoming World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin, September 
      30 – October 4, 2014. Neonorm™ Calf, a non-prescription product, is the 
      latest advance in neonatal calf care that improves gut health by 
      promoting normal stool care and rapidly reducing dehydration and the 
      time to recovery. Jaguar is launching the product, which has been 
      clinically tested in controlled studies in preweaned dairy calves with 
      scours, in partnership with ANIMART, Inc. (“ANIMART”), a Wisconsin-based 
      supplier of animal health products and veterinary supplies for dairy and 
      livestock producers. Additionally, in conjunction with the launch of 
      Neonorm™ Calf, Jaguar recently hired the first of several planned sales 
      representatives to spearhead a focused direct sales effort intended to 
      provide continuity for the education and scientific promotion of 
      Neonorm™ Calf and to complement ANIMART’s efforts in the six-state 
      “Midwest” territory.
    


      According to Ian Parker, Jaguar’s Vice President of Commercial 
      Development, “The Neonorm™ Calf launch at the Word Dairy Expo is a key 
      milestone achievement for Jaguar. This is a meeting where global opinion 
      leaders in the dairy industry including veterinarians, dairy producers 
      and industry partners convene to evaluate cutting-edge research in the 
      field and modern technologies. As scours causes significant financial 
      loss to the dairy industry, this meeting represents an important 
      opportunity for Jaguar to communicate the positive health and economic 
      benefits of our product to the dairy community.”
    

      “Additionally,” Parker noted, “Jaguar believes that ANIMART’s regional 
      leadership, combined with the impact of their recently hosted continuing 
      education program to highlight calf care, for certified veterinary 
      technicians, will increase the effectiveness of our outreach efforts.”
    

      Jaguar indicated the regional Neonorm™ Calf launch will focus on several 
      key dairy states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. The product 
      has been tested by leading researchers at Cornell University, the 
      results of which will be submitted for publication and presentation in 
      scientific peer reviewed journals and select veterinary congresses.
    

      Jaguar anticipates that its national launch of Neonorm™ Calf will occur 
      by the end of 2014. Further testing of Neonorm™ Calf involving 1,300 
      calves is ongoing at the following leading veterinary academic 
      institutions: Cornell University, Tufts University and the University of 
      California at Davis.
    

About Neonorm™ Calf


      Neonorm™ Calf is an enteric-coated tablet designed to be orally 
      administered to preweaned dairy calves twice daily for three days. It 
      has been formulated and clinically tested to specifically address the 
      normalization of stool formation and ion and water flow in the 
      intestinal lumen of newborn dairy calves. The product acts locally in 
      the gut and is minimally absorbed systemically. It does not alter 
      gastrointestinal motility, and to date, has shown no significant effects 
      on normally functioning intestinal ion channels and electrolyte or fluid 
      transport, nor shown any side effects different from placebo. As a 
      result, stool formation is normalized in a short period of time, weight 
      loss is mitigated, supportive care costs and rehydration therapies such 
      as oral rehydration solution, or ORS, are reduced. Neonorm has not been 
      evaluated by the FDA for use in animals.
    

About Jaguar Animal Health, Inc.


      Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. is an animal health company focused on 
      developing and commercializing first-in-class gastrointestinal products 
      for companion and production animals. Canalevia™ is Jaguar’s lead 
      prescription drug product candidate for the treatment of various forms 
      of watery diarrhea in dogs. Neonorm™ Calf is the company’s lead 
      non-prescription product. Canalevia™ is a canine-specific formulation of 
      crofelemer, an active pharmaceutical ingredient isolated and purified 
      from the Croton lechleri tree. Neonorm is a botanical extract 
      derived from the Croton lechleri tree. Canalevia™ and Neonorm™ 
      are distinct products that act at the same last step in a physiological 
      pathway generally present in mammals. Jaguar has filed eight 
      investigational new animal drug applications, or INADs, with the FDA and 
      intends to develop species-specific formulations of Neonorm in six 
      additional target species.

Stockholders of Jaguar Animal Health and Napo Pharmaceuticals Vote to Approve Merger


SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAGX) (Jaguar) and Napo 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Napo) announced that at separate special 
      stockholder meetings today the stockholders of both companies approved 
      proposals recommended by the Jaguar and Napo boards regarding the merger 
      of Jaguar and Napo.
    

      The merger transaction remains on track to become effective on Monday, 
      July 31, 2017, at which point Jaguar’s name will be changed to Jaguar 
      Health, Inc., and Napo will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
      Jaguar focused on human health and the ongoing commercialization of 
      Mytesi®, which is approved by the U.S. FDA for the 
      symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on 
      antiretroviral therapy. As previously announced, the terms of the merger 
      include funding for the combined company and for other aspects of the 
      merger as disclosed in the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus.
    

      “Today’s votes represent a pivotal development in the evolution of both 
      companies. It is truly transformational for Jaguar Health to 
      forward-integrate into an important revenue stream from Mytesi®, 
      for which the company will hold unencumbered global rights and is 
      pursuing multiple follow-on indications for various chronic 
      gastrointestinal disorders. This merger speaks to the shared vision and 
      persistence of the dedicated and talented team members at both Jaguar 
      and Napo—some of whom have worked for more than 20 years to change the 
      standard of care for gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals,” 
      stated Lisa Conte, Jaguar's president and CEO and Napo’s interim CEO. 
      “We are grateful for the continued enthusiasm and support for this 
      merger, and we remain excited about the opportunity we believe this 
      combination will create for our stockholders as well as Mytesi® 
      patients and animals.”

About Mytesi®


      Mytesi® (crofelemer) is an antidiarrheal indicated for the 
      symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patients with 
      HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mytesi® is not 
      indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. Rule out infectious 
      etiologies of diarrhea before starting Mytesi®. If infectious 
      etiologies are not considered, there is a risk that patients with 
      infectious etiologies will not receive the appropriate therapy and their 
      disease may worsen. In clinical studies, the most common adverse 
      reactions occurring at a rate greater than placebo were upper 
      respiratory tract infection (5.7%), bronchitis (3.9%), cough (3.5%), 
      flatulence (3.1%), and increased bilirubin (3.1%).
    

      More information and complete Prescribing Information are available at Mytesi.com. 
      Crofelemer, the active ingredient in Mytesi®, is a botanical 
      (plant-based) drug extracted and purified from the red bark sap of the 
      medicinal Croton lechleri tree in the Amazon rainforest. Napo has 
      established a sustainable harvesting program for crofelemer to ensure a 
      high degree of quality and ecological integrity.

      San Francisco-based Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. focuses on the 
      development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for the
