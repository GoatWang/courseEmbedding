Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP ("National Civil Pension Fund"), frequently referred to as ABP, is the pension fund for government and education employees in the Netherlands. For the quarter ended 31 December 2014, ABP had 2.8 million participants and assets under management of €344 billion ($388 billion, 1 EUR=1.13 USD), making it the largest pension fund in the Netherlands and among the five largest pension funds in the world as at September 2016.[1]
ABP’s predecessor, the Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds ("Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund"), was established in 1922 following the adoption of the superannuation act, which regulated the pensions of civil servants. Originally, the pension fund was a government controlled entity that fell under the authority of the minister of home affairs in The Hague. In January 1996, ABP was privatized although its primary function remains unchanged.
Since 1 March 2008 ABP's subsidiary APG administers the ABP pension scheme.
ABP is headquartered in Heerlen, Netherlands. On 1 January 2015, Corien Wortmann-Kool took the chair as Chairman of the Board.

Pensions[edit]
The pensions supplement statutory benefits such as the old age pension AOW, surviving dependents' pension, and incapacity benefits. If the participant stops working between the ages of 60 and 70, he/she will receive the ABP Multi-Option Pension. If the participant dies, his/her partner and children may receive an ABP Survivor’s Pension. If the participant becomes unfit for work, the government will pay incapacity benefits under the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA); ABP can supplement these benefits with an incapacity pension.
Since 1 January 2004, ABP pensions are based on average salaries during the course of the pensioners’ careers. This is known as an average-salary scheme. As a transition measure, benefits accrued before 2004 are based on the salary on 1 January 2004. Only members of the armed forces now have pensions based on their final salaries.[2]
Both contributions and accrual of benefits are based on the salary minus a threshold (2008: €10,100 per year). The reason for the threshold is the fact that the pension is a supplement to the AOW, etc.
Investments[edit]
ABP manages the bulk of its investments in-house through its captive investment unit APG Investments, a privately owned investment manager. APG operates as a subsidiary of Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and was formerly known as ABP Investments.
In 2006, ABP and PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, considered a spinoff of their investment management businesses. The two pension funds coordinate their activities in private equity through AlpInvest Partners, one of the largest investors globally in the private equity asset class. Recently, AlpInvest Partners was acquired by the Carlyle group.
In January 2014, Dutch newspaper Trouw reported that ABP acknowledged continuing their investment in Israeli banks Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, each of which fund Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories.[3]
US investment activities[edit]
In the United States, as in Europe, ABP is a major investor in financial markets including public equity, fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds and private equity.
According to information published by ABP,[citation needed] its largest US investments include ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Boston Properties, Public Storage, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
Hedge fund investments[edit]
New Holland Capital (NHC)[4] is an independent investment company with 20 investment professionals based in New York City.

Website

Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP ("National Civil Pension Fund"), frequently referred to as ABP, is the pension fund for government and education employees in the Netherlands. For the quarter ended 31 December 2014, ABP had 2.8 million participants and assets under management of €344 billion ($388 billion, 1 EUR=1.13 USD), making it the largest pension fund in the Netherlands and among the five largest pension funds in the world as at September 2016.[1]
ABP’s predecessor, the Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds ("Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund"), was established in 1922 following the adoption of the superannuation act, which regulated the pensions of civil servants. Originally, the pension fund was a government controlled entity that fell under the authority of the minister of home affairs in The Hague. In January 1996, ABP was privatized although its primary function remains unchanged.
Since 1 March 2008 ABP's subsidiary APG administers the ABP pension scheme.
ABP is headquartered in Heerlen, Netherlands. On 1 January 2015, Corien Wortmann-Kool took the chair as Chairman of the Board.

Pensions[edit]
The pensions supplement statutory benefits such as the old age pension AOW, surviving dependents' pension, and incapacity benefits. If the participant stops working between the ages of 60 and 70, he/she will receive the ABP Multi-Option Pension. If the participant dies, his/her partner and children may receive an ABP Survivor’s Pension. If the participant becomes unfit for work, the government will pay incapacity benefits under the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA); ABP can supplement these benefits with an incapacity pension.
Since 1 January 2004, ABP pensions are based on average salaries during the course of the pensioners’ careers. This is known as an average-salary scheme. As a transition measure, benefits accrued before 2004 are based on the salary on 1 January 2004. Only members of the armed forces now have pensions based on their final salaries.[2]
Both contributions and accrual of benefits are based on the salary minus a threshold (2008: €10,100 per year). The reason for the threshold is the fact that the pension is a supplement to the AOW, etc.
Investments[edit]
ABP manages the bulk of its investments in-house through its captive investment unit APG Investments, a privately owned investment manager. APG operates as a subsidiary of Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and was formerly known as ABP Investments.
In 2006, ABP and PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, considered a spinoff of their investment management businesses. The two pension funds coordinate their activities in private equity through AlpInvest Partners, one of the largest investors globally in the private equity asset class. Recently, AlpInvest Partners was acquired by the Carlyle group.
In January 2014, Dutch newspaper Trouw reported that ABP acknowledged continuing their investment in Israeli banks Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, each of which fund Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories.[3]
US investment activities[edit]
In the United States, as in Europe, ABP is a major investor in financial markets including public equity, fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds and private equity.
According to information published by ABP,[citation needed] its largest US investments include ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Boston Properties, Public Storage, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
Hedge fund investments[edit]
New Holland Capital (NHC)[4] is an independent investment company with 20 investment professionals based in New York City. NHC manages a $15 billion portfolio of hedge fund investments exclusively on behalf of APG Investments. NHC provides APG Investments a continuity of professional management of its hedge fund portfolio.
NHC was founded in October 2002 by Ira Handler as ABP's internal fund of hedge funds team and completed a spinout in 2006.[5][6][7]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP ("National Civil Pension Fund"), frequently referred to as ABP, is the pension fund for government and education employees in the Netherlands. For the quarter ended 31 December 2014, ABP had 2.8 million participants and assets under management of €344 billion ($388 billion, 1 EUR=1.13 USD), making it the largest pension fund in the Netherlands and among the five largest pension funds in the world as at September 2016.[1]
ABP’s predecessor, the Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds ("Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund"), was established in 1922 following the adoption of the superannuation act, which regulated the pensions of civil servants. Originally, the pension fund was a government controlled entity that fell under the authority of the minister of home affairs in The Hague. In January 1996, ABP was privatized although its primary function remains unchanged.
Since 1 March 2008 ABP's subsidiary APG administers the ABP pension scheme.
ABP is headquartered in Heerlen, Netherlands. On 1 January 2015, Corien Wortmann-Kool took the chair as Chairman of the Board.

Pensions[edit]
The pensions supplement statutory benefits such as the old age pension AOW, surviving dependents' pension, and incapacity benefits. If the participant stops working between the ages of 60 and 70, he/she will receive the ABP Multi-Option Pension. If the participant dies, his/her partner and children may receive an ABP Survivor’s Pension. If the participant becomes unfit for work, the government will pay incapacity benefits under the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA); ABP can supplement these benefits with an incapacity pension.
Since 1 January 2004, ABP pensions are based on average salaries during the course of the pensioners’ careers. This is known as an average-salary scheme. As a transition measure, benefits accrued before 2004 are based on the salary on 1 January 2004. Only members of the armed forces now have pensions based on their final salaries.[2]
Both contributions and accrual of benefits are based on the salary minus a threshold (2008: €10,100 per year). The reason for the threshold is the fact that the pension is a supplement to the AOW, etc.
Investments[edit]
ABP manages the bulk of its investments in-house through its captive investment unit APG Investments, a privately owned investment manager. APG operates as a subsidiary of Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and was formerly known as ABP Investments.
In 2006, ABP and PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, considered a spinoff of their investment management businesses. The two pension funds coordinate their activities in private equity through AlpInvest Partners, one of the largest investors globally in the private equity asset class. Recently, AlpInvest Partners was acquired by the Carlyle group.
In January 2014, Dutch newspaper Trouw reported that ABP acknowledged continuing their investment in Israeli banks Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, each of which fund Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories.[3]
US investment activities[edit]
In the United States, as in Europe, ABP is a major investor in financial markets including public equity, fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds and private equity.
According to information published by ABP,[citation needed] its largest US investments include ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Boston Properties, Public Storage, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
Hedge fund investments[edit]
New Holland Capital (NHC)[4] is an independent investment company with 20 investment professionals based in New York City. NHC manages a $15 billion portfolio of hedge fund investments exclusively on behalf of APG Investments. NHC provides APG Investments a continuity of professional management of its hedge fund portfolio.
NHC was founded in October 2002 by Ira Handler as ABP's internal fund of hedge funds team and completed a spinout in 2006.[5][6][7]
Private equity investments[edit]
AlpInvest Partners, founded in 1999 is the exclusive manager of private equity investments for APG and fellow Dutch pension group Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn. AlpInvest is one of the largest private equity investment managers globally with over €40 billion (approximately $50 billion) under management at the end of 2007. AlpInvest has offices in Amsterdam, New York City, Hong Kong and London with over 60 investment professionals and over 100 employees.[8][9][10][11] AlpInvest pursues investment opportunities across the entire spectrum of private equity: buyout, venture capital, growth capital, mezzanine and distressed. AlpInvest also invests across the range of private equity investment channels:

Equity co-investments
Primary fund investments
Mezzanine investments
Secondary investments

Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP ("National Civil Pension Fund"), frequently referred to as ABP, is the pension fund for government and education employees in the Netherlands. For the quarter ended 31 December 2014, ABP had 2.8 million participants and assets under management of €344 billion ($388 billion, 1 EUR=1.13 USD), making it the largest pension fund in the Netherlands and among the five largest pension funds in the world as at September 2016.[1]
ABP’s predecessor, the Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds ("Dutch Civil Servants Pension Fund"), was established in 1922 following the adoption of the superannuation act, which regulated the pensions of civil servants. Originally, the pension fund was a government controlled entity that fell under the authority of the minister of home affairs in The Hague. In January 1996, ABP was privatized although its primary function remains unchanged.
Since 1 March 2008 ABP's subsidiary APG administers the ABP pension scheme.
ABP is headquartered in Heerlen, Netherlands. On 1 January 2015, Corien Wortmann-Kool took the chair as Chairman of the Board.

Pensions[edit]
The pensions supplement statutory benefits such as the old age pension AOW, surviving dependents' pension, and incapacity benefits. If the participant stops working between the ages of 60 and 70, he/she will receive the ABP Multi-Option Pension. If the participant dies, his/her partner and children may receive an ABP Survivor’s Pension. If the participant becomes unfit for work, the government will pay incapacity benefits under the Work and Income (Ability to Work) Act (WIA); ABP can supplement these benefits with an incapacity pension.
Since 1 January 2004, ABP pensions are based on average salaries during the course of the pensioners’ careers. This is known as an average-salary scheme. As a transition measure, benefits accrued before 2004 are based on the salary on 1 January 2004. Only members of the armed forces now have pensions based on their final salaries.[2]
Both contributions and accrual of benefits are based on the salary minus a threshold (2008: €10,100 per year). The reason for the threshold is the fact that the pension is a supplement to the AOW, etc.
Investments[edit]
ABP manages the bulk of its investments in-house through its captive investment unit APG Investments, a privately owned investment manager. APG operates as a subsidiary of Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and was formerly known as ABP Investments.
In 2006, ABP and PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, considered a spinoff of their investment management businesses. The two pension funds coordinate their activities in private equity through AlpInvest Partners, one of the largest investors globally in the private equity asset class. Recently, AlpInvest Partners was acquired by the Carlyle group.
In January 2014, Dutch newspaper Trouw reported that ABP acknowledged continuing their investment in Israeli banks Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, and Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot, each of which fund Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories.[3]
US investment activities[edit]
In the United States, as in Europe, ABP is a major investor in financial markets including public equity, fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds and private equity.
According to information published by ABP,[citation needed] its largest US investments include ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Boston Properties, Public Storage, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
Hedge fund investments[edit]
New Holland Capital (NHC)[4] is an independent investment company with 20 investment professionals based in New York City. NHC manages a $15 billion portfolio of hedge fund investments exclusively on behalf of APG Investments. NHC provides APG Investments a continuity of professional management of its hedge fund portfolio.
NHC was founded in October 2002 by Ira Handler as ABP's internal fund of hedge funds team and completed a spinout in 2006.[5][6][7]
Private equity investments[edit]
AlpInvest Partners, founded in 1999 is the exclusive manager of private equity investments for APG and fellow Dutch pension group Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn. AlpInvest is one of the largest private equity investment managers globally with over €40 billion (approximately $50 billion) under management at the end of 2007. AlpInvest has offices in Amsterdam, New York City, Hong Kong and London with over 60 investment professionals and over 100 employees.[8][9][10][11] AlpInvest pursues investment opportunities across the entire spectrum of private equity: buyout, venture capital, growth capital, mezzanine and distressed. AlpInvest also invests across the range of private equity investment channels:

Equity co-investments
Primary fund investments
Mezzanine investments
Secondary investments

About us














Who we are

For almost 100 years ABP has been the pension fund for people working in the government and education sectors. As many as 1 in 6 people in the Netherlands now receives or will receive a pension in the future from ABP. Pension is the income you receive when you stop working, when you become unfit for work or that your surviving dependants receive in the event of your death.

What we want

We want a good pension for everyone, now and in the future, in exchange for an affordable contribution. This is only possible if we continue to view pension as something we organize together. By collectively investing all pension contributions we can achieve a higher return than any one of us could achieve with an individual savings account. As one of the largest pension funds in the world, our influence is significant. This is why we also ensure that our investments contribute to a sustainable world. Indeed, just like a pension, we not only think of ourselves, but also of the generations that follow us.
