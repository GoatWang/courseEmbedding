      ■ Guerrino De Luca had the experience that Logitech needed when he
      became its president and chief executive officer in 1998: he was an
      engineer who knew marketing. Under his direction, sales of Logitech
      products exploded. In 1999, after 19 years in existence, the company sold
      its 200 millionth mouse; it sold its 300 millionth mouse in 2000, its 400
      millionth in 2001, and its 500 millionth in 2002. De Luca led Logitech
      into new markets such as those of Webcams and gameconsole controllers,
      rivaling IBM and Microsoft in the worldwide sales of computer peripherals.
    

      APPLE
    

      De Luca received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from
      the University of Rome. He began his career at Italy's Olivetti,
      working in research and development and eventually becoming the manager of
      product development and sales for Olivetti's networking unit. After
      11 years at Olivetti, he took a job at Apple, spending most of his time in
      Paris, where he took charge of Apple's European marketing. In April
      1995 he

      was appointed president of Claris Corporation, a subsidiary of Apple that
      developed personal software. In the mid-1990s Apple was suffering from net
      losses and demoralized management, and in February 1997 De Luca was
      appointed executive vice president of marketing and made responsible for
      directing Apple's worldwide sales efforts. He worked 18-hour days,
      seven days a week trying to repair Apple's sales efforts, until he
      quit out of exhaustion, leaving the company on September 17, 1997.
    

      LOGITECH
    

      Logitech had had problems in the 1990s: when personal-computer sales
      dipped in 1992, Logitech mouse sales dipped as well, because the company
      sold its mice primarily to computer manufacturers. Logitech proceeded to
      sell its European
       and American factories in order to pay debts, leaving most of its
      manufacturing to be carried out in China. The then CEO Daniel Borel
      decided to try to separate Logitech sales from computer sales by
      emphasizing direct retail markets, producing peripherals that computer
      owners would buy independently in order to enhance their technological
      experiences. In spite of Borel's efforts, Logitech continued to
      suffer from poor marketing strategies until De Luca joined as president
      and CEO in February 1998, with Borel becoming chairman of the board.
    

      De Luca brought to his work an ebullient personality and a mischievous
      streak, as well as a talent for mixing comfortably with his employees,
      which enabled him to learn from workers what was working well and what was
      not. He quickly made his presence felt at Logitech by reorienting the
      corporate culture to being consumer rather than technology
      directed—meaning the company would tout style and special features
      instead of merely pushing out the latest technological advances. De Luca
      pushed wireless and optical computer interfaces; he also engineered the
      purchase in November 1998 of the QuickCam division from Connectix for $25
      million, thus increasing Logitech's worldwide share of Webcam sales
      from 4 to 50 percent. That year Logitech introduced the first computer
      video camera with a built-in microphone.
    

      From 1998 to 2000 Logitech's stock price quadrupled, and sales grew
      30 percent annually. In 1998 Logitech shares were worth $8 each; in August
      2000 they were worth $33 each after briefly hitting a high of $39. For
      fiscal 1999 Logitech grossed $470.7 million, while netting $7.1 million.
      In 1999 Logitech pressed into the Internet market by introducing iTouch
      software that enhanced keyboard functionality in navigating the Web. In
      2000 Logitech provided Apple with a new mouse to ship with its Macintosh
      computers; Logitech was in possession of 30 percent of the computer-mouse
      market worldwide. "You have your hand on your mouse 50 percent of
      the time you're using the PC. It's about time people paid
      attention to it," De Luca told 
      
        Forbes.com
      
       (August 28, 2000). For fiscal 2000 Logitech grossed $615.7 million,
      netting $30 million.
    

      In 2001 personal-computer sales dropped 14 percent during a global
      downturn in the high-tech industry; yet Logitech stock increased 60
      percent on sales of $944 million and profits of $75 million. De Luca
      remarked on 
      
        Forbes.com
      
      , "We are in the PC industry but we are not influenced by PC
      sales" (November 5, 2001). That is, his marketing strategy had
      successfully persuaded retail consumers to buy Logitech products not as
      necessary components of new computers but as enhancements for computers
      they already owned. In 2001, 85 percent of Logitech's income
      resulted from retail sales, the remaining 15 percent being earned through
      personal-computer manufacturers. In January 2001 De Luca dyed his hair
      fuschia before a meeting with Zurich bankers, which he had promised to do
      if his sales staff met their goals for 2000. The incident solidified his
      reputation as a good-natured leader. His daughter told him his pink hair
      was "cool." In 2001 Logitech expanded into the game-console
      market by introducing a cordless joystick and a steering wheel for
      Sony's PlayStation 2. In addition, De Luca directed the purchase of
      Labtech, the manufacturer of computer speakers and headsets.
    

      In 2002 industry analysts and journalists expressed worry over
      Logitech's expansion into accessories for game consoles and
      handheld computers, as well as into the manufacture of trackballs,
      wireless and optical mice, and computer video cameras during a period of
      lagging computer sales. Yet Logitech achieved a 37 percent gross margin in
      2002 while capturing 45 percent of the world computer video camera market
      and 55 percent of the world trackball market, and it sold over 3 million
      units of a new line of cordless keyboard-mouse combination. Financial
      analysts had trouble understanding how Logitech's optical-mouse
      sales remained strong; De Luca noted that his company's own survey
      indicated that consumers liked the way the optical mice glowed. He had
      hired a European design firm to create mice that were not only comfortable
      in the hand but looked sleek and stylish. Logitech ads showed him smiling
      and toying with mice that were both functional and beautiful.
    

      In 2003 Logitech reached $1 billion in revenue for the first time. For the
      fiscal year 2003, Logitech netted $94 million. Still, in 
      
        Business Week
      
       De Luca insisted, "We can never afford to think we walk on
      water" (June 17, 2002), reminding himself that any success could be
      fleeting. But he seemed to have tapped into an essential truth in
      marketing: people want beauty in their lives, even in everyday tools such
      as mice and keyboards, and will pay for it.

      president for marketing, Apple Computer, 1997; president and chief
      executive officer, Logitech International, 1998–.
    

      Sidelights
    

      Guerrino De Luca has guided Logitech International into one of the
      world's most successful makers of computer peripherals. As
      president and chief executive officer since 1998, De Luca has overseen the
      company's entry into the retail sector with well-timed launches of
      the newest mice, game controllers, digital pens, and even MP3 and
      Bluetooth wireless accessories. He credits his long stint with Apple
      Computer as key to helping Logitech become dominant in its market.
      "I learned a lot about products," he told Kim Girard in 
      
        Chief Executive
      
      , "a lot about designing and ease of use and how to think of the
      customer, and the consumer and the user first."
    

      Born in 1952, De Luca hails from Lanciano, a town near Rome, Italy. He
      attended the University of Rome, and after earning a degree in electrical
      engineering went to work for one of Italy's biggest companies,
      Olivetti. Founded as a manufacturer of typewriters early in the twentieth
      century, Olivetti was branching out into consumer electronics by the time
      De Luca joined it, including video display terminals and the first
      rudimentary computers that offered videotext services over telephone lines
      in the pre-Internet era to European consumers. He eventually rose to
      become director of Olivetti's networking products division before
      moving over to Apple Computer.
    

      De Luca rose to head Apple's European marketing division before
      being made chief executive officer for Claris, Apple's independent
      software maker in 1995. By that time, Apple's once-impressive sales
      figures had slowed down, but under De Luca's management Claris did
      well and even entered the Top Ten rankings among the world's
      software companies. In 1997, when Apple chief executive of-
      ficer Gil Amelio shifted some of his executives in a reorganization plan
      designed to rescue Apple's still-plummeting sales and reputation,
      De Luca was put in charge of worldwide marketing. He was even predicted as
      a possible future CEO of Apple himself. But 1997 brought many other
      changes for the company, among them the return of one of its founders,
      Steve Jobs, and Amelio was soon ousted. Jobs became Apple's CEO,
      and with that De Luca resigned from the company. A year later, he candidly
      admitted to a reporter for a London newspaper that while he had immense
      respect for Jobs, whom he conceded "may be the greatest, most
      creative person on earth," he told Cliff Joseph in the 
      
        Independent
      
      , "he's not a nice person to work with."
    

      A year later, De Luca moved on to Logitech, which had been founded 17
      years earlier in Switzerland, as president and chief executive officer. Up
      until this point, Logitech was a relatively unknown maker of mice and
      other computer peripherals. Its revenues relied on deals it struck with
      computer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell to produce the mice
      that came along in the box with the PC hardware and monitor. De Luca, with
      his excellent track record in marketing strategies, was brought aboard to
      help establish the company's products on the consumer market by
      themselves. The advantages of this plan were twofold: Logitech products,
      if sold separately at retail, netted the company much higher profit
      margins than in contracts with computer manufacturers. Secondly, if the
      personal computer market slowed or even stalled, users were still likely
      to purchase the latest-technology mouse or other peripheral as a
      budget-conscious upgrade.
    

      De Luca believed it crucial that Logitech seek out new technologies, and
      one of his first major scores at the company involved its acquisition of a
      webcam manufacturer, Connectix, for $25 million at the end of 1998.
      Logitech executives had originally hesitated over the deal, because they
      had been working on their own version of a webcam, but the decision proved
      lucrative in the end: During the next three years, Logitech sold $180
      million worth of webcams, mostly to home-computer users. It was a segment
      of the market that had been largely ignored in favor of courting large
      corporate business, which proved uneasy with moving into the
      videoconferencing frontier.
    

      De Luca moved forward with other new products, most of them priced under
      $100, such as speakers, microphones, gaming controllers for Sony
      Playstation 2, and a new wireless mouse and keyboard combination. Even he
      could sometimes err, he admitted to 
      
        Investor's Business Daily
      
       writer Patrick Seitz, citing the wireless-peripheral package as one
      example of a time when Logitech nearly missed the boat. "Fresh from
      my marketing skills at Apple I said, 'People don't buy
      combination products. They buy the best mouse or the best
      keyboard.'" he told Seitz. "I was profoundly
      wrong."
    

      De Luca has been credited with helping Logitech's financial
      performance surge ahead in the peripherals market. In 1999, the year after
      he became CEO, Logitech posted sales of $471 million; three years later,
      that figure had more than doubled, to $960 million. Its stock, traded on
      the Swiss Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, was a
      favorite of analysts and investors alike, with the price of its share
      quadrupling since De Luca came on board. Furthermore, the strategy to
      enter the retail market had proved wise: There had indeed come a downturn
      in computer sales during the recession that began in 2001, but Logitech
      had done surprisingly well despite it, as home users opted to upgrade
      their mice or keyboard, or add new web-cam technology instead of replacing
      the entire desktop or notebook computer.
    

      Perhaps recalling his time at Apple, De Luca has deliberately tried to
      cultivate a good working relationship with his staff at Logitech, which
      has offices in Fremont, California. He once issued a target goal to his
      sales force, and promised he would dye his hair pink if it were achieved.
      It was, and he did, turning up at a conference of investment bankers in
      Switzerland with fuchsia highlights. "It really tested my
      self-confidence," De Luca recalled in an interview with 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      . "But people thought: 'This guy comes from California, and
      even if we don't understand it, it must be OK.'" He
      lives in San Francisco with his wife, Daniela, who is an artist. They have
      two grown daughters.
