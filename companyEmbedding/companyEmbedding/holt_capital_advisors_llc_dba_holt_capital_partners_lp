Holt Capital Partners, L.P.

Holt Capital Partners, L.P.


    We believe that it is critical to align our interests with those of our clients.  We are compensated only by the fees paid to us by our clients.  This minimizes potential conflicts of interest and ensures that our clients receive impartial advice.  In addition, we believe that it is important to invest our assets along with our clients.  In this regard, the firm’s founder has significant assets invested in all three strategies.  Other examples of co-investment include private equity investment opportunities in which the firm’s founder and clients have invested on identical terms. 


     



Holt Capital Partners, L.P.


    Our firm manages client assets utilizing one or more of our five investment strategies.  We work  with clients in order to develop investment guidelines, create an asset allocation, and implement an investment strategy to achieve their specific long-term risk and return objectives.  Client assets can be structured across a range of strategies from traditional actively managed equity or fixed income portfolios to cost effective passive investment strategies.  The firm’s strategies are all available as separately managed portfolios.  Active IndexingAn asset allocation strategy that is implemented across domestic equities, international equities or fixed income securities.  The strategy utilizes exchange-traded funds to position portfolios for superior performance.  The same proprietary growth and value models that are used to identify individual stocks in the large cap strategy are utilized to build the appropriate asset allocation at the index level.Our Fixed Income strategy emphasizes short and intermediate maturities in order to reduce price volatility.  Portfolios include investment grade and below investment grade securities, depending upon individual client objectives.Dividend YieldOur firm's Dividend Yield strategy is designed to provide broadly diversified and cost efficient exposure to quality companies with high and rising dividend yields.  These portfolios tend to exhibit lower price volatility than the S&P 500 Index.  The investment process utilizes the firm's proprietary growth and value models in order to identify the most attractive sources of dividend income in the equity market.  The implementation process is typically focused on low cost, tax efficient exchange-traded funds.Large Cap Growth and ValueA large cap investment strategy that utilizes our proprietary quantitative growth and value models.  It is designed to be a core holding for investors with an S&P 500 benchmark.  The growth strategy identifies companies with strong growth characteristics and the value strategy focuses on stocks that are selling at historically low valuations.  The diversification of two distinct strategies, as well as positions in approximately 100 different stocks, reduces the price volatility, i.e., risk, of the portfolio.Value EquityThe investment objective of the Value Equity strategy is long-term capital appreciation with a moderate level of risk.  The strategy seeks to identify companies that are undervalued as a result of temporary factors that create negative investor sentiment.  We base our decision process on a three to five year investment horizon which enables us to focus on the valuation of a business in relation to its long-term fundamentals.Inflation HedgeThe objective of this strategy is to provide long-term returns in excess of the CPI, with strong relative performance during periods of rising inflation.  This strategy is implemented through a concentrated portfolio of publicly traded securities with significant ownership of real estate, timberland, oil and gas reserves, and other "hard assets". 


     



Holt Capital Partners, L.P.


    Our firm provides clients with an objective and independent source for the review and analysis of their multi-asset class or multi-manager investment portfolios. We can function as the outsourced “Chief Investment Officer” providing ongoing analysis and advice regarding complex multi-strategy investment portfolios or we can provide a one time analysis of an existing portfolio structure. We combine over thirty-nine years of portfolio management experience with a disciplined analytical approach in order to evaluate asset allocation, manager performance, investment expenses, and tax efficiency.  If our analysis leads to the restructuring of a client’s portfolio, we can implement the necessary changes with passive investment strategies or through the selection and evaluation of active managers.  Our manager search process seeks to identify firms that are in the investment management profession, rather than the business of asset gathering.

Holt Capital Partners, L.P.


    Holt Capital Partners, L.P. provides investment management and consulting services to high net worth families, retirement plans, foundations and other entities.  We believe that diversification should extend beyond traditional allocations between stocks and bonds.  Our approach to investment management includes both actively managed and passive strategies, as well as a "hard asset" strategy designed to protect against the risk of rising inflation.  Investment decisions benefit from the depth and breadth of the firm's portfolio management experience.

What are analysts saying about Express Scripts Holding Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Express Scripts Holding Company stock: 
1. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "We believe ESRX remains a Buy given our view that company fundamentals, including its FCF, are stable and that the stock's valuation is attractive at 9x FY18 P/E. That said, we recognize that headlines surrounding drug pricing pressure and the overhang from ESRX's Anthem contract will drive continued stock volatility NT." (2/17/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Express Scripts’ fourth-quarter 2016 results were mixed, wherein adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues beat the same. In the past three months, the company has underperformed the broader industry with respect to price performance. While the company’s guidance for 2017 was encouraging, tough competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Management space and the persistent drug pricing issue are expected to affect the share price. Express Scripts stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. The company is focused on the development of both specialty drugs and generics, which are expected to account for 50% of the total drug expenditure by 2018. Further, its SafeGuardRx suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend in turn, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes." (2/16/2017)
3. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "We continue to believe ESRX will seek to buy Rite Aid’s PBM unit from Walgreens if the deal closes successfully and possibly add its generic purchasing clout to Walgreen’s buying consortium for added economics. Derivatives: At a time when hapless politicians are wringing their wrists about out of control drug costs, we cite another example of a large government payor tapping PBM solutions for greater savings. As opposed to Anthem, TRICARE utilizes a number of ESRX’s cost management tools in addition to a preferred pharmacy network to better manage its trend. We see the PBM model as more rather than less relevant to the current situation, and we see longer-term enhanced roles for PBMs in Medicare part D and B. Separately, we see AmerisourceBergen as benefiting from the news as Walgreen’s supplier, while Cardinal Health stand to lose some share as CVS’s partner." (10/3/2016)

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 8 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.79 (12.44% upside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ascena Retail Group (NASDAQ:DBRN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
