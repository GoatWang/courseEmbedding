ITEM 3.
SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION  Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D
is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof: 
On December 6, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Underwriting Agreement with GI III-A, GI III-B, Ladder HoldCo, the other selling
stockholders party thereto (collectively, the Selling Stockholders), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, as representative of the several underwriters (the
Underwriters), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to (i) sell 10,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) provide the Underwriters an option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from
certain Selling Stockholders other than the Reporting Persons (the Option Shares), in an underwritten offering (the December 2016 Offering). On December 7, 2016, the Underwriters exercised their option to purchase the Option
Shares.  In connection with the December 2016 Offering, on December 8, 2016, Ladder Holdco exchanged an aggregate of 3,137,211 shares of
Class B Common Stock and Units into 3,137,211 shares of Class A Common Stock. No cash or other consideration was exchanged in connection with the foregoing exchange.   


ITEM 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION  Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with
effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof:  In connection with the
December 2016 Offering, on December 12, 2016, GI III-A, GI III-B and Ladder HoldCo completed a sale of an aggregate 3,789,446 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Underwriters at a public offering price of $13.60 per share. 
In connection with the December 2016 Offering, GI III-A, GI III-B and Ladder HoldCo agreed, subject to specified exceptions, not to offer,
pledge or sell, or enter into any agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer, any shares of Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock, for a period of 60 days
after December 6, 2016, except with the prior written consent of the Underwriters (the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement). 
References to and descriptions of the December 2016 Lock-up Agreement set forth above in this Item 4 do not purport to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
