Jim Getz
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We are delighted with TriState Capital's performance in the second quarter of 2017, notably, on a year-over-year basis.
Total assets grew organically by 22%. Loans grew organically by a record $774 million or nearly 26% with strong contributions across all channels. Even as our loan book nears the $4 billion mark, we cut adverse rated credits for just $34 million and non-performers to less than $8 million. Deposits grew by more than 22% as we match our funding needs to support loan growth. Net interest income grew by a record $3.8 million or nearly 21%. Non-interest, primarily Chartwell Investment management fees represented 34% of total revenue. Total revenue grew by more than 13%, and most importantly, earnings per share grew 21%.
While these are all highlights from the last three months, we do not consider the second quarter to be exceptional for TriState Capital given how we execute our highly differentiated growth strategy. Rather these results are emblematic of how we successfully put our shareholders' capital to work in diverse businesses delivering exceptional growth over the long term.
Accordingly, we have confidence in a number of milestones targeted in the years ahead for our company. We believe TriState Capital can and should have a billion dollar market cap in the next 24 months, compared to more than $700 million today, and about $400 million a year ago. In the next 12 months, we intend to grow organically past the milestone of $5 billion in bank assets. We will continue to grow total deposits to fund lending with non-interest-bearing deposits beginning to increase in the second half of 2017. We intend to show meaningful non-interest-bearing deposit growth in 2018.

For 2017, we expect net interest income to increase by more than 20% over 2016. We intend to complete another highly accretive investment management acquisition in the next 18 to 24 months as part of our plan to significantly expand Chartwell assets under management. For 2017, we believe Chartwell revenues will be in line with last year's investment management fees.
As evidenced by our performance this year, TriState Capital continues to achieve critical mass with our infrastructure, resources, and capabilities, which we have built to support a financial institution with banking and investment management business multiple times larger than we have in place today. Today, we are showing even more of the benefits of our operating leverage illustrated by the 460 basis point reduction in TriState Capital Bank's efficiency ratio over the last year to 55% in the second quarter of 2017, right in line with our targeted efficiency ratio range of the mid-to-high 50s.
On a consolidated basis, second quarter non-interest expenses were about $22 million, just 2.1% of average assets annualized. Keep in mind this metric includes the expense of the non-bank business, which is a major contributor to our top and bottom lines, though not the balance sheet. Since 2015, our first full calendar year after entering investment management, TriState Capital's annualized non-interest expense ranged from 2.1% to 2.4% of average assets. This compares very favorably to the 2.8% average of bank holding companies with $3 billion to $5 billion in assets. And many of those peers operate without a non-bank business as meaningful as TriState Capital's.
The bank's total assets were $4.2 billion at June 30th, 2017, a full $780 million greater than one year ago, and almost double what it was four years ago after our IPO. Our team is very focused on both growing and diversifying our high-quality loan portfolio, and our efforts have been highly productive. June 30th total loans of $3.8 billion were $774 million greater than a year ago. Our quarterly growth was impressive as well, adding $234 million in net loans compared to the prior quarter, an increase of some 6.6%.
Private banking loans made up 52% of total loans, as of June 30th, with net production of more than $130 million since March of this year, and more than $530 million since June of 2016. We continue to expect to grow private banking loans by 30% to 35% for full-year 2017, as high net worth clients complete new applications at a record rate.
In the first six months of this year, the number of new client applications is in line with the number completed in the entire year 2015. And we are also well ahead of last year's pace. These results clearly illustrate the success of our company's unique and highly scalable business model. Our relationship driven team is connected to a growing national referral network, through which we are able to market TriState Capital Bank in Chartwell to even more clients. This network of financial intermediaries continues to expand and totals some 153 firms, up from 131 a year ago.
As we have demonstrated in the past, we are readily able to fund a growth opportunity in both commercial and private banking. For the later, we believe TriState Capital is the premier private bank franchise in the nation today. We intend to further strengthen our unique franchise and widen the defensive moat around TriState Capital's unique non-purpose margin lending business. We expect to continue the growth of the private banking loans using our strategic funding, unrivaled national distribution network, proprietary technology, expertise, and client experience. Our team's focus on growing regional middle market commercial business also continues to pay off as anticipated.

Healthy commercial and industrial loan originations led to a $54 million increase in commercial and industrial loans in the second quarter alone. Taking C&I balances to nearly 640 million at June 30th, an increase of 11.5% from a year ago. We've established well-defined niche in the middle market lending, are increasing becoming a financial service partner of choice for select businesses throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, and New York. Increased M&A activity and our four-state footprint also has created disruption that our team has turned into a relationship building opportunity. With C&I loan growth outpaced commercial rent led real estate lending, as planned CRE lending will remain a major piece of our middle market business.
Commercial real estate grew by 49 million to $1.2 billion during the second quarter. We continue to maintain our focus on in-market projects with in-market barrowers. Asset quality remained exceptionally sound even as we continued to profitably expand our loan portfolio compared to one year prior at June 30th 2017. Adverse rated credits declined 99 basis points to just 0.90% of total loans and totaled only $34 million. Non-performing loans declined 43 basis points, just 0.21% of total loans versus the recent average of 0.95% for $3 billion - $5 billion banks.
Non-performing loans now totaled less than $8 million. And non-performing assets declined 32 basis points to just 0.27% of total assets versus the recent peer average of 0.81%. Provision expense for the second quarter was $516,000. This reflected the period's significant loan growth particularly in C&I, which requires higher reserve levels in private banking loans.
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were approximately $733,000 or 0.08% of average total loans. We took a sole C&I charge off during the second quarter of the million dollars, a majority of which had been previously reserved. As I highlighted earlier, deposits grew 22% over the last year and by more than 6% during the second quarter, promptly putting new liquidity to work in our best growing loan book. To-date, we have already seen the funding benefits from our investments in relationship managers, capabilities and distribution to expand TriState Capital's treasury and liquidity management offerings.
As mentioned before, we expect to see a greater portion of future liquidity growth coming from non-interest bearing deposits and operating account balances initially in the second half of this year, but even more meaningfully into 2018 as we work to onboard significant pipeline of new and expanded relationship opportunities that we had been building. In the meantime, our asset sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned to take advantage of continued interest rate increases. At the end of the second quarter, 90% of our loan portfolio and 38% of our securities portfolio were floating rate. The bulk of our loans reset on the first of each month.
As you have probably seen many times, our business model is designed to drive growth in net interest income dollars. In the second quarter, net interest margin of 2.23% was essentially flat compared to the link quarter due to the continuing shift in loan mix and the sourcing of strategic deposit relationships. For the quarter, net interest income dollars grew more than 5% to a record $22 million. Margin expansion is expected to resume in the upcoming quarter.
Non-interest income, which is largely made up Chartwell investment management fees, was than $11 million in the recent quarter or approximately 34% of TriState Capital's total revenue. While Chartwell Investment Partners' revenue was down slightly in the second quarter year-over-year, it was up more than 12% in the first six months of 2017 verus the first half of last year. This reflects our April 2016 acquisition of The Killen Group's investment management business including The Berwyn Funds and our success in driving the organic growth of those high-performing products.

Our highly accretive Chartwell and Killen Group acquisitions have been major drivers of this company's earnings power further diversifying our sources of revenue and lowering the risk profile of the company. Chartwell's assets under management were $8 billion on June 30th, reflecting outflows of $733 million in the second quarter, primarily from small and mid-cap growth equity products, which you'll recall we brought under new leadership last year. We now have the right growth strategy team in place as demonstrated by their performance right out of the gate in late 2016. And we believe we will soon be able to reverse the net redemptions trend with these products.
In addition, the growth equity products command a significantly higher weighted average fee rate today than they did last year. Seventy two basis points for Chartwell's growth strategies in the second quarter 2017 compared to just 30 basis points early in 2016. This combined with The Berwyn's strategies acquired last year is a significant contributor to Chartwell's overall weighted average fee rate, climbing to 46 basis points in the second quarter of 2017, up from 36 basis points prior to the Killen acquisition. That's an additional $1 million in revenue for every billion dollars in assets under management.
So the new and longstanding accounts Chartwell serves today are clearly stronger and more profitable than they were one year ago. We are very pleased with how the business is running today. Chartwell's inflows totaled $157 million in the second quarter, driven by a combination of our dedicated sales and marketing efforts, our distribution and perhaps most importantly highly credible investment performance against benchmarks and peers. Ten of 15 Chartwell and Berwyn investment disciplines beat their benchmarks on one-year performance. Nine of 15 disciplines beat their benchmarks on three-year performance, and nine of 14 disciplines beat their benchmarks on five-year performance.
Not surprisingly, some of our top performing strategies have been some of our most productive on the business development front. For example, Chartwell's mid-cap value fund saw very strong net inflows of $49 million even as the rest of the industry saw significant outflows from domestic mid-cap equity strategies in the second quarter. Chartwell's mid-cap value strategy is a prime beneficiary of the robust retail distribution program we put in place after acquiring a investment management business in 2014.
In addition while hybrid strategies across the industry saw billions in net redemptions in the second quarter. The Morningstar five star rated Berwyn Income Fund strategy Buck the Trend with only nominal net outflows. The conservative allocation strategy is highly attractive to clients looking for Berwyn Income Fund's uniquely successful combination of downside protection and upside exposure. And, as the industry enjoyed healthy gains in the bond funds in the second quarter, Chartwell short duration BB rated high yield fixed income strategy took full advantage of that momentum to drive net inflows of $220 million. This strategy has been very much in demand among the new and existing accounts.
These three strategies are prime examples of how Chartwell is offering a unique set of investment products with strong track records which are not easily replicated with passive strategies. We clearly see tremendous opportunities to grow Chartwell both organically and through investment management acquisitions.
TriState Capital is well on its way to building a fortress national private banking franchise, a world-class investment management business, and a regional middle market commercial bank of choice. We have the tools in place, a highly motivated and talented team of professionals who thrive in our relationship-focused sales-driven culture, an unparalleled distribution network, and a growing base of high-quality clients. We remain very confident about our potential for continued success ahead.

Before opening the call to questions and answers, I first want to acknowledge an executive appointment we announced yesterday. Brian Fetterolf, who many of our shareholders already know, was named Chief Executive Officer of TriState Capital Bank subsidiary. He has joined the Board of Directors of the bank and the holding company. Brian is a proven leader who managed many areas of our business since he joined our organization eight years ago. Most recently, since becoming President of the bank in 2015, he lead a talented team of people who are driving superior loan growth and managing the significant expansion of our deposit and territory management capabilities. As President and CEO of the bank, Brain will be responsible for all aspects of the strategy, execution, and performance of the subsidiary. His leadership experience and commitment to TriState Capital will be a great benefit to our company and its shareholders as our company continues to execute its growth strategy.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now ask Vice Chairman and CFO Mark Sullivan to join me for questions and answers. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Perito of KBW. Please go ahead.
Michael Perito
Hi, good morning, Jim and Mark.
Jim Getz
Good morning, Michael.
Michael Perito
Couple of questions, maybe I'll start with Mark on the margin. I appreciate the commentary, Jim, about kind of what you guys are expecting going forward, but maybe if we could just dial in on the current quarter from in here. What do you guys expect? I mean, it seems like non-interest-bearing deposit growth is expected to pick up which will help the overall kind of cost of deposit in terms of the increase. But it looked liked some of the other interest-bearing accounts saw some fairly sizable increases quarter-over-quarter. What are you guys seeing in the marketplace today in terms of pricing on your interesting-bearing deposit instruments, and what are the expectations of that going forward?
Mark Sullivan
Yes, good morning, Mike. Mike, the asset sensitivity we have can be used to drive margin expansion, it could it also be used to secure deposits in a quarter where we want to achieve that type of deposit growth. Our key focus is keeping the NII strong. On a year-to-year basis our NII is up 21%, and 5% for the linked quarter. Having said that, looking forward to Q3, we expect margin expansion similar to what you saw in Q1. So we continue to see the increase in net interest income 20% to 25% range for the full-year.
Michael Perito
Okay. But I guess as it relates specifically to kind of what you're seeing in the marketplace on some of the pricing on your interest-bearing deposits, I mean is there increasing demand from some of commercial clients and of some of your other deposit-type consumers for higher rate? I mean is that something that you guys think you're going to have to continue to battle here or was there something unique in the quarter? Or do you expect it to kind of be choppy; I guess there'll be some quarters where it's up more than last? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the trajectory of those costs will be.
Mark Sullivan
Yes, I mean we feel we addressed that in the current quarter, and that we'll be able to maintain the deposit base with more discipline, if you will, and as we go into Q3. So we don't expect to see the increase in cost of funds Q3 that we saw in Q2.
Jim Getz
This is Jim, Mike. What you want to keep in mind is that the asset base of this company has been growing pretty handily over the past many years. And as you're well aware, this is not the first call that we've had that we've discussed net interest margin. And if you look at the history f our net interest margin, just look at it quarterly NIM compared to same quarter one year prior, if you look over has been compressed or flat since the IPO year, 2013. Just think of that quarter-to-quarter compressed or flat since the IPO year. But if you look at it on a linked quarter basis NIM has expanded only six quarters since the IPO for our company. Yet, if you look at the earnings per share, the EPS has delivered growth in 13 quarters year-over-year since the IPO, and 12 of those quarters were double or triple-digit numbers. And we believe the EPS is the value creation for the shareholder.

And as you know, we're investing strongly in the future, yet providing highly attractive double-digit EPS growth on a relatively consistent basis. And I think what you want to keep in mind here, if you even look at the consensus numbers that the analysts have provided us with, we're looking at a consensus of about a 20% - 20%-plus jump this year in EPS, and over a 30% jump next year. And this management team has not challenged that number. So I think you have to put this in perspective as a company, and recognize where the focus is. Now, to answer your question very directly, we have had very meaningful deposit growth while a lot in the industry have not had that in the near term. And much of our deposit growth in the last quarter was back loaded so it did have an impact on the rates that we were paying during the second quarter.
You didn't see the full impact in the first quarter, but that is one of the reasons why we feel very strongly that we're going to have a robust third quarter. But keep in mind, the real focus here is net interest income at the end of the day. And our NII over the past year has grown by 21%. And if you look at the entire industry, it's been single-digit numbers.
Michael Perito
Got it, yes, and you guys know I appreciate that. I'm just trying to get some color on some of the deposit stuff. And then maybe following up, my second, Mark, on the expenses, maybe a high level question, you know, the expense front was pretty good in the quarter. Obviously you guys are a high-growth company, but it does seem like you have a lot of scale in place. I mean any thoughts on kind of what you expect over the next 12 months in terms of the expense run rate?
Mark Sullivan
Yes. Mike, I would say the -- similar to last quarter's comments about the run rate. We're really comfortable with the consensus estimate for the year, even though the first half has been somewhat favorably impacted, but I think $23 million is a good quarterly run rate for the second half of the year, and probably percentage ramp up as we go into '18, I can address that better later in the year. But for the second half of the year I think the run rate of 23 probably takes us to consensus for the year.
Jim Getz
And Mike, we don't want you to think we don't love you. We realize this question was on everyone's mind, so we were prepared to answer it.
Michael Perito
I was shocked.
Operator
The next question comes from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Olney
Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Getz
Good morning.
Matt Olney
In the prepared remarks I believe, Jim, you mentioned that 90% of the loan portfolio was going to be variable. So I'm curious how the execution of the re-pricing of these loans has been over the last few months. What's been the level of pushback within each of your three categories?
Mark Sullivan
We've had no level of pushback whatsoever. I guess by pushback are you meaning that we've seen a decline in what we can get for a loan or the pricing?
Matt Olney
Yes, exactly. And then I guess specifically in the private banking loans, I mean it's somewhat of a newer segment over the last several years…
Mark Sullivan
Actually, to be quite honest with you, that book of business has been quite stable since inception, except there's an aspect of it. And I think we may have talked about it before, where you're seeing a lot of these large wirehouses, groups of their folks are moving to the registered investment advisors, and setting up their own shop. And the wirehouses have had some advantages of having some offshore facilities they provided their high net worth clients to. And we've been responding to our client base as people are transitioning by helping them for a period of time bring those clients over with the idea that the rate would increase at first than them coming over maybe a year-and-a-half or so later. But you're really looking at this book of business being around 2% over 30-day LIBOR. And if you look at what the yield of it, it's close to 3% counting the legacy loans that we have in place; the private banking portfolio is about 3%.

Matt Olney
Got it, okay, thanks for the color; and then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about overall capital levels, and because of the impressive loan growth we've seen capital ratios move down the last few quarters. I'm curious how much cushion do you think you have on capital? What do you view as a concerning capital ratio?
Mark Sullivan
Matt, I'd say it's really consistent with the past that the loan growth, a lot of it majority being private banking, gives us some real elbowroom on capital. And with the earnings increase as we go forward really don't see that much pressure on our capital as we go forward. It's really going to be an acquisition with intangible and asset management acquisition that's going to cause us to look at capital and make a determination. But absent an acquisition, forward runway well into '18.
Matt Olney
Okay, thanks, Mark. I'll hop back in the queue.
Operator
The next question comes from Russell Gunther of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Russell Gunther
Hi, good morning guys.
Jim Getz
Good morning, Russell.
Russell Gunther
Appreciate the color on loan growth in the prepared remarks. It's really nice to see C&I really turn the corner here, if you could just give us some color where the growth came from, both geographically and kind of from a customer sector perspective.
Jim Getz
It came broadly from all of our locations, our five locations. We particularly picked up a meaningful amount of business in Philadelphia region. And as you're probably aware, there's been a lot of disruption there with Susquehanna and Nat Penn acquired by BB&T. So Philadelphia has sort of led the charge. But everyone fully participated. And keep in mind we've been indicating for the past two quarters this would be coming. And this is a result of an investment that we made two-and-a-half years ago in brining people onboard that were purely focused on direct C&I activity. And if you really do a deep dive on the C&I loans you discover that our average size loan has dropped handily, because we're doing essentially sole bank deals at this time in some volume.
Russell Gunther
I appreciate that. And then second question, unrelated. You mentioned expectations for Chartwell, and appreciate the color on the strategy there. I think you're rough guidance calls for a modest pickup in related revenue in the back half of this year. But absent an accretive acquisition in that space, could you talk a little about what the organic revenue opportunity there would be in 2018 based on some of those strategies you laid out earlier.
Jim Getz
Yes, if you -- and unfortunately we had the issue from a flow standpoint of November of '16 loosing the Vanguard account on the gross side, and our performance, as we indicated to everyone was in fact subpar. And you've seen the flows coming out of the growth strategy that both the mid-end and the small cap this year. We believe that that is now stabilized. We believe the current manager there has done a very credible job since he's been with us since October of last year. And he has a very good team backing him up. As you're probably aware, in this business it'd probably take you from the time you recognize your issues till you get it corrected, and that disciple, it'll probably take 24 months.
So, we're well into the first year of the recovery before you're going to see some meaningful uptick. But in the interim, we couldn't be more pleased with the quality investment performance of the remainder of the franchise. I went over the numbers with you. We're seeing meaningful flows into the mid cap value product. We've gotten them on some good platforms. We're getting a little bit of response also from the institutional clients, which you don't normally see. And we're really carved out a niche product that Andy Toburen runs at Chartwell, this short-duration high yield that we're consistently seeing good strong, as I illustrated in my comments, flows into that. And we reaffirmed in my comments that we fully expect the company will produce the level of revenue it did in 2016, and keep in mind, this is after loosing almost $3 billion [Technical Difficulty]

Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Matt Schultheis of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.
Matt Schultheis
Good morning.
Jim Getz
Good morning, Matt.
Matt Schultheis
Quick question on the tax credit you took in the quarter, if you could just add any color of where that came from, what that looks like, and if we could expect to see that in the future?
Jim Getz
Yes, Matt. Good morning. The credits, if you look at the first quarter, we were in the low 30s. We had not secured the credits at that time and couldn't recognize them. Similar to prior years, we had both housing and alternative energy credits that we secured in the second quarter. And that's -- it was our appetite, if you will, for this year. So the quarter expense was 26.5. That was also a pickup from the higher rate through one. So a go-forward, 30% is the effective rate we're looking at this year.
Matt Schultheis
And could you add any color regarding risk-adjusted loan pricing in the C&I markets. Is it matching your expectations, is it getting worse as more banks continue to shift from CRE into C&I? So any color you could add there would be appreciated.
Jim Getz
At the moment, Matt, we haven't seen any change whatsoever, it's consistent with prior quarters. So we don't see any movement upward at this point other than obviously LIBOR has changed somewhat, so the return is reflected in the NII you're seeing. But otherwise, we're not seeing much pressure at all either way.
Matt Schultheis
Okay, thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Bryce Rowe of Baird. Please go ahead.
Bryce Rowe
Thank you. Jim and Mark, just wanted to maybe try to get some color around the compared remarks around non-interest-bearing growth in the back half, non-interest-bearing deposit growth in the back half of this year? And into 2018, are there any specific goals that you have internally?
Jim Getz
If you take a look at our balance sheet, you are going to see that our non-interest bearing deposits are minuscule. They are less than 6% on the balance sheet. And probably in retrospect, we should have focused more on treasury management a few years ago and we didn't. And so, about 24 months ago, we recognized the need to build up a major franchise in this area. So in fact, we began making commitments. And we've spent at this point several million dollars on personnel. We've just implemented and put in place in on-boarding clients with a very sophisticated updated system in this regard.
So we fully expect to double our non-interest bearing deposits by the end of next year and move this along very rapidly. And this business also brings in lower interest-bearing deposit. So, it'll be in the range of about something that's somewhat over $600 million by the end of next year, and we are beginning to see some real progress. The average balances in our operating accounts in the second quarter is 16, we are around 235 million. And today they are pushing on 300 million.
So it's increase of about 25%. We are dealing with that lower number so the percentages look good, but we are really focused on growing that as we grow this franchise and to reduce the expense -- the interest expense in a meaningful manner over the next couple of years. And this is also one of the best times to be doing this because there is a lot of turmoil in the marketplace around treasury management. Particularly with the larger banks because they have been flushed with cash, the deposits aren't as attractive to them any longer. Thus what they are doing is increasing -- converting it from a funding mechanism to non-interest income and raising the fees pretty handedly to the clients. And so, obviously we're focused on the deposits complemented with the non-interest income. So we have a real opportunity here. We have a strong pipeline. And I am just giving you some very practical numbers, but -- that you can count on. But we are confident this is a multi-billion dollar business we are going to be involved in.

Bryce Rowe
Great. That's helpful, Jim. And wanted to follow-up to one of Mike's questions about interest-bearing deposit cost, Mark, just to be clear, so, in the back half of this year maybe even in the third quarter, we shouldn't expect to see much of an increase in terms of funding cost?
Mark Sullivan
Yes, I mean I think that's fair. There will be an increase but not to the degree that you saw in Q2.
Bryce Rowe
Right. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Olney
Hi, thanks. Just one follow-up, at the Investor Day a few weeks ago, I think you had mentioned a goal of yours was to achieve ROE in the fourth quarter of 10%. I just wanted to make sure that's still a reasonable goal in your mind.
Jim Getz
Yes, definitely, it is, Matt. If you look back a year ago, at June 30 16, our ROE was 8.16. This quarter it's 9.27, up over 100 basis points. So, we are still on target to 10 ROE by Q4.
Matt Olney
Okay. That's all from me. Thanks.
Jim Getz
Thank you.
Operator
And the next question is a follow-up from Michael Perito of KBW. Please go ahead.
Michael Perito
Hey, thanks guys for taking follow-up. Just curious now that we've had this kind of first quarter where the C&I portfolio kind of meaningfully expanded, just -- obviously you saw a nice growth across all three segments. I think maybe last quarter, Jim, you had some comments that you expected to see ROE growth to not quite be as robust in C&I and private banking, but just any high level kind of thoughts moving forward about or updated thoughts rather by where you think kind of the loan mix could settle in here for over the three segments over the next 12 months or so?
Jim Getz
Yes. As we have today the private banking, there is nothing that's going to catch with that. So you're probably looking at that to be at the end of the year. It could be as much as 55% of the loan portfolio, up about 3% from where it is at this point. And the reason that I say that, Mike, is that if you look at this company historically, private banking's weakest period of time was the first half of the year, okay, historically, since we have been really working on this. So we expect to have a more robust second half of the year. And to you an illustration of how strongly activity has been if you look at the -- take you back to the second quarter of 2014, we processed 180 applications -- 180 applications and so on secured by marketable securities, this second quarter we processed 600 -- 600, this is by far the strongest first half that we've had and that was just the second quarter numbers -- 600. And if you look at 2015, we've done more in the first half of the year than we did in all 2015 applications. So that's going to be very strong -- I would say just to finish your question, we're hoping to see C&I in the range pushing, going into the new year of about 20% of the loan portfolio and the rest would be in commercial real estate.
Michael Perito
Okay. And do you think it's fair -- I mean I know for the last several years since the IPO, it's kind of always been the overtime 15% kind of loan growth CAGR, target could be little higher, could be a little lower. It seems like though I mean pretty confidently you guys kind of place you were for the next few years, you are going to be a little higher than that, do you think that's a fair statement at this point?
Jim Getz
Like I mentioned at the Investor Day that many of you were at when you put a company together from scratch like we have, you are really look out no more than two years. And I would say that you are probably looking at us with a -- about a 20% loan growth rate for this year and next year.
Michael Perito
Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Jim Getz
If not better. You're welcome.

Jim Getz
Good morning and thank you for joining us. The third quarter of 2016 was an outstanding quarter and our best yet as a public company. Robust earnings growth reflected new record levels of net interest income, fees and total revenue. These positives continue to reflect our expanding commercial banking, private banking and asset management businesses, which are firing on all cylinders, giving the company exceptional loan growth even better deposit growth and healthy assets under management growth. This was all achieved while maintaining excellent credit quality, making about $12 million in additional risk-based capital available to the bank and executing on our asset management acquisition strategy.
Let me begin with a few specific highlights from the third quarter. The results again showcased TriState Capital’s unique risk profile and diversified financial services business model.
With a proven ability to consistently generate robust earnings through sustainable revenue growth, we consistently increased net interest income dollars through strategic loan and deposit growth with a strong risk adjusted return that outpaces margin compression.
Quarter-end loans surpassed $3 billion for the first time ever, totaling $3.2 billion at September 30. Loans grew by $513 million or more than 19% over the last 12 months and by $1.5 billion since our 2013 IPO. Exceptional organic growth in quality loans is something we’ve achieved in a low rate environment, really since our bank’s inception in 2007.

In private banking, loan balances grew more than 32% over the last year to $1.6 billion, despite volatile equity markets over the last 12 months. Our private banking channel lending makes up half of all loans and demonstrates the effectiveness of our financial services distribution capability, which we continue to expand at an exceptional rate.
Our national referral network of financial intermediaries is up to 136 firms, from 131 at the end of the second quarter, which provides us with access to tens of thousands of independent financial advisors, who can refer and recommend our financial products to our clients. In addition, one of our established relationships had very favorable implications for TriState Capital Bank’s regulatory capital position at the end of the third quarter. Basel III rules recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of certain non-purpose margin loans secured with financial collateral that is priced daily of over collateralized and liquid.
In the third quarter of 2016, we completed the onboarding of loans from an established referral network member on to our proprietary system, which provides daily pricing. This financial intermediary is one of the nation’s largest independent broker dealers with about $120 million of its client private banking loans within TriState Capital at quarter end. The net effect is at about $12 million of additional regulatory capital was made available to the bank on September 30. Accordingly, our bank subsidiary’s total risk-based capital ratio increased by 64 basis points in the third quarter from 12.24% to 12.88%.
Our other important lending channel, regional middle-market commercial banking delivered a strong quarter, as well. At September 30, commercial balances totaled $1.6 billion, up some 8.6% from one year prior. Commercial real estate loans, which crossed $1 billion mark for the first time at quarter end, increased 23% from one year prior. This growth is a product of high quality opportunities we see in the geographic markets served by Tristate Capital’s five regional offices. The investments we’ve made to capitalize on them by growing those offices with highly experienced people and some disruption we see as a result of larger bank consolidation in those areas.
Owner occupied commercial real estate also continues to represent more than 10% of our commercial real estate portfolio. Along side private banking, commercial real estate and direct commercial loans are an important part of our 15% long-term annual loan growth goal, to which we remain fully committed.
In commercial industrial lending we saw $220 million in payoffs and pay downs over the last 12 months, as we continue to mange adjustments to the balance sheet, payoffs and pay downs were partially offset by $156 million in new commercial and industrial loan originations over the last 12 months. We continue to anticipate positive growth in our portfolio of direct C&I business in the quarters ahead. In fact, in the most recent period, we generated $46 million of new originations, our highest this year, versus $54 million of payoffs and paydowns.
As strong as our loan growth was in the last three months, it was fully funded by deposits for the third consecutive quarter. Deposits increased by 7% in the third quarter and 19% from year ago. Following our investments in bankers whose mandate is specifically to gather low cost, relationship driven, institutional deposits through superior service, industry knowledge and product sophistication.
Asset quality also remains a strong focus at TriState Capital Bank, a product of our credit management discipline and our strategy for driving significant portion of loan growth for marketable securities backed lending. Adverse rated credits declined meaningfully over the last year, representing just 1.59% of total loans at the end of the third quarter 2016, down from 2.08%, one year prior.

Our $542,000 credit to provision expense in the three months ending September 30, reflects declining adverse rated credits and net recoveries offset by increases specific reserves on non-performing loans. At the same, our allowance for loan losses grew seven basis points during the third quarter to 0.64% of total loans.
Non-performing loans represented just 0.65% of total loans at the end of the third quarter, down from 0.72% one year prior. TriState Capital’s non-performing loans to loans, is also a 59 basis points below the recent average for our peer index, which was 1.24% for $1 billion to $5 billion asset banks.
Our non-performing assets at the end of the third quarter represented 0.67% of total assets unchanged from one year prior and significantly below the recent period index average of 1.08%.
The non-performing asset balance did increase during the third quarter. So I wanted to provide some additional details on NPAs for you this morning. During the third quarter, we received clear title to property which was placed on outperforming loans status back in 2009 and had been charged down in 2010 to $2.9 million. The property, which consist of eight parcels have been tied up in litigation for the past eight years. Three of the parcels had been sold by TriState Capital for a total of $2.7 million and the proceeds were placed in Escrow until the litigation was settled. Upon the favorable core resolution the Escrow cash was released and applied against the loan balance, the remaining five parcels were placed in OREO at a current net appraisal value of $3.6 million in the last two weeks of September.
While very favorable outcome was obtained it does result in a slight increase in our NPAs as a $2.9 million decrease in non-performing loans as affectively been replaced with a $3.6 million increase in non-performing assets. The Escrow parcels were sold above their price announced and we are confident the parcels representing $3.6 million will be sold at or above their price announced over the next 12 months to 24 months. The balance of NPAs reflects $20.7 million of non-performing loans of which there are six. Only one of the six is not paying as agreed. It is an unsecured consumer loan in the books for less than $225,000. The remaining five representing 99% of non-performing loans are making payments as agreed.
Turning to Chartwell Investment Partners, our primary sources of fee income, pushed non-interest income to 40% of total revenue in the third quarter. Investment management fees grew some 47% to more than $10 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $7 million in the same period last year. Chartwell’s assets under management grew by nearly 42%, to $10.8 billion over the last year with inflows and market appreciation offsetting the outflows that have been felt by the entire industry this year today, as many of you in this call know well.
We have experienced $1.1 billion of organic growth since the Chartwell acquisition in March of 2014. The weighted average fee rate was 38 basis points at the end of the quarter and Chartwell’s annualized revenue run rate exceeded $41 million, up nearly 48% from one-year prior. And our investment management business contributed $1.7 million to net earnings in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 61% from the third quarter of 2015.
Chartwell’s established newly acquired investment strategies continue to deliver highly credible performance during the third quarter, as well. Of Chartwell’s 16 investment disciplines including the small and mid-cap value strategies launched in 2016, ten beat their benchmarks in year-to-date performance, seven beat their benchmarks on three-year performance and eight beat their benchmarks on five-year performance.

One additional note on Killen and our third quarter results, as you can see from yesterday's news release we reduced previously accrued contingent earnout expenses associated with the Killen transaction by some $1.2 million. As we shared with you on our July conference call, Killen experienced significant outflows in the 16 months leading up to deal closing.
We were able to neutralize and reverse this trend by deploying our distribution and sales capabilities to probably market its proven investment strategies, particularly in the five-star rated Berwyn Income Fund.
While we stop the run off the growth by 12/31/2016 will likely not materialize the degree that we anticipated. Accordingly we reduced our run rate EBITDA estimate which results in a $1.2 million reversal of our accrual. We are also very excited about the investment management transaction we announced yesterday, bringing top tech talent and critical mass in fixed income to Chartwell.
We entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a team of six fixed income investment professionals in Philadelphia and about $4 billion of institutional clients’ assets under management from Aberdeen Asset Management. As with our last acquisition we intend to put our powerful financial services distribution network to work with these investment professionals and their domestic fixed income strategies.
Importantly, this transaction further leverages the scalable infrastructure and administrative personnel we already have in place at Chartwell today. We expect to close by the first quarter of 2017. Under the terms of agreement no upfront consideration will be paid, that may repeat, no upfront consideration will be paid. The purchase price is payable in the first quarter of 2018 at 1.5 times revenue on actual client assets under management at the end of next year. As with our last acquisition, this structure protects TriState Capital from any interim declining assets under management.
We will pay a multiple of 1.5 times run rate revenue based on assets under management as of December 31, 2017. That’s equivalent to about 3.3 times EBITDA, the value of the all cash transaction is expected to be in the range of $11.5 million to $13.5 million. And we believe it compares favorably to our prior two acquisitions in this space, not to mention the investment management industry multiples in general. An outline of this transaction is available on our website.
We have known to senior managers to this fixed income team for many years and have followed their performance very closely. We believe this is an accretive transaction that will benefit to all parties bringing Chartwell outstanding taxable fixed income talent along with client assets. And we expect to provide our newest team members with the resources and properly structured incentives that need to thrive – they need to thrive and take their business for the next level.
Before we turn it over to questions, I wanted to touch on our share repurchase program. If you recall, at the beginning of this year we initiated a $10 million program and today we’ve repurchased 334,275 shares for approximately $4.3 million at an average cost of $12.89 per share. Much of this balance was used for an options cancellation program which we eliminated significant overhanging on the shares.
Fully vested options are more than one million shares granted to employees in 2007 with the $10 exercise price were cancel at an average rate of $4.92, for a total of $5.2 million. Even with the appreciation of Tristate Capital shares in recent months, we continue to believe that our stock remains undervalued relative to our financial performance and prospects. Reflecting our commitment to return value to stockholders at our regular October meeting on Tuesday, The Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to another $5 million.

Our confidence in Tristate Capital’s performance and prospects continues to be reflected in our high level of insider ownership, which exceeds 23%. All of our directors have meaningful ownership positions in Tristate Capital stock and all of our executive officers maintain personal seven figure investments in the Company closely aligned our interest with those of all our shareholders.
As successful as we have been to date, we believe we are only beginning to realize Tristate Capital’s full potential, as we execute our growth strategy with continued discipline and bigger.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Now I’ll ask Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Sullivan; as well as Chartwell Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Riddle, to join me for questions and answers. Operator please open the line.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Perito of KBW. Please go ahead.
Michael Perito
Good morning.
Jim Getz
Good morning, Mike.
Michael Perito
A couple questions. Maybe starting on the margin for Mark. Can you maybe talk a little bit about it seems like the loan yields are getting a bit closer to where the perceivable trough might be. Obviously, as the private banking piece grows. But can you give us some color on what you guys see there? And also just remind us, if we do see maybe a 25 basis point move in the Fed at year end what kind of benefit you would perceive on the net-interest income?
Mark Sullivan
Sure, thanks, Mike. Good point and the NIM, it did decrease seven bips in this quarter, there is a couple of observations on that. On a one-year basis the NIM is down 15 basis points. At the same time our net interest income was up 10%. So looking at the two factors that impact NIM, the yield on a loan portfolio it continues as you indicated, continues to have pressure because of the outside growth of the private banking portfolio. The portfolio has never lost a dollar and is zero risk-weighted.
In terms of the cost of funds, on a go-forward basis, we do expect to see the results of our investment in our treasury management platform, both the people and technology and increase deposit gathering focus. Jim mentioned the last three quarters deposit growth has exceeded loan growth in both at extremely beneficial rates. So we may see some improvement in Q4, but it’s really in the first half of 2017 that the results will have an impact.
In terms of if we had another Fed increase in December, similar to December of 2016 a 25 basis increase would have a very positive impact on us. And if you recall the spread initially, the big impact is in the first quarter and by the second’s quarter it begins to dissipate as the pressure on cost of funds. But we earned about $700,000 attributable to the increase in the first quarter 2016, additional NII with the increased loan base and so forth that should be closer to a $1 million for Q1.
Michael Perito
Okay. Thanks for that color, Mark. And then maybe from a second question, on the Aberdeen transaction. So, obviously the considerations are going to be paid at the end of next year. But in terms of the impact on capital. That will hit in the first quarter, correct? In terms of the intangibles and the impact on capital? And maybe also, comment Jim, on just obviously you freed up some regulatory capital in the quarter. But maybe in terms of your capital outlook. Have you had any thoughts on adding anything to the capital stack as we get out and the growth continues into 2017 and 2018?
Mark Sullivan
Yes Mike, this is Mark, in terms of the capital and so forth, the fee raised are about 755 right now and tangible book value, we would expect that with the delusion coming on in Q1 that by the earnings that we have in Q4 and Q1 that we backed to where it is today. Another factor, when you are looking at the impacted delusion on an acquisition like this in a bank, acquisition typically in fact maybe 30% of the purchase price and goodwill and goodwill and intangibles, well as and we are looking for that to be paid back in five years or less.

And in asset management acquisition virtually 100% of the purchase price, it is in goodwill and intangibles and we’d expect to recover that in our case in under five years, 100% of the purchase price under five years on a GAAP basis and under four years on a cash basis.
So, we are not overly concerned about the short-term impact of the dilution on tangible book value T ratios and our capital ratios continue to growth between the earnings. And as Jim had mentioned the increase in $120 million in loans were 100% risk-weighted and now our zero risk-weighted.
Michael Perito
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Mark Sullivan
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Olney
Hi, thanks. Good morning guys.
Jim Getz
Good morning Matt.
Matt Olney
Jim, you've indicated that the drag on loans in the last few years has been C&I. It sounds like C&I drag is stabilizing. I'm curious what this inflection point means for the future loan growth? Are we are going to see better loan growth than we've seen over the last few years? Or could it just be a more balanced type of mix of future loan growth?
Jim Getz
I think you’re going to see a combination of the both, because it’s taken us now a couple of years to stabilize this and now we’re moving forward. And I think you’re going to begin to see that proven out in the fourth quarter. As you are aware with continually reinforced the 15% growth yet if you go over the numbers we’ve been close to 19% to 20% growth in loan outstandings and that’s what C&I has been a drag.
So we’re very optimistic moving forward here and feel very confident in the future quarters with reference to the growth that we’re going to experience in the loan portfolio now to be ultimately, positively impacted by the C&I activity.
Matt Olney
And then as a follow-up Jim, the private banking loan growth was a very strong in the third quarter. Anything specific you attribute this to? And any update in the overall level of competition for this niche product?
Jim Getz
Well, a couple of things that I would indicate to you is that, we’ve had relatively over the past couple of months, we’ve had a relatively stable market. And when you have that, you have a lot of financial advisors that will in that environment consider moving from one organization to another. And many of them are moving out of the larger wire houses like the Morgan Stanley’s, the Merrill Lynch’s and setting up their own shops and groups. And these are top producers that have a lot of confidence in their ability to build business.
And so they’re going to a lot of the registered investment advisors that we’re working with and their best clients have loans and those loans have to be paid off at Goldman, and Morgan Stanley and Merrill. And so we’re seeing a lot of A-Cap [ph] transactions occurring in the marketplace that are building a lot of froth in that business. So it’s not just the standard book of businesses that we have from the trust companies in the regional brokerage firms, there’s a lot of movement activity from one firm to another that we’re benefiting from.
Matt Olney
And Jim the second part of that was about the overall competition for that niche product?
Jim Getz
It’s a non-existent. I hate to be that direct, but there isn’t any type of competition of any formidable nation that we’re coming across.
Matt Olney
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from John Moran of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
John Moran
Hey, good morning guys.
Jim Getz
Good morning.
Tim Riddle
Hey, John.
John Moran
Of course, I've got my two on private bank loans also. How many more of those do you have left that could qualify for favorable treatment under Basil III?
Jim Getz
That you could see some additional capital coming in.

John Moran
Exactly, yes.
Jim Getz
Not enough. But what I mean by that is, what happens, the reason is occurred and if you remember several quarters ago we alluded to this. We’re very dependent on conversions with the IT Group at the broker dealer, or the trust company, or the advisor. And we need their cooperation. So these folks had been doing business with us for a little over 12 months and we were monitoring this. But it wasn’t on our system and if it’s not on our system we don’t treat it accordingly. So right now this was the only major party that had been accumulating over time at this point.
John Moran
Got you. So substantially all of them are now qualified under Basel III?
Jim Getz
I wish I could tell you we had a surprise every quarter but that won’t be the case.
John Moran
Okay. Got it.
Mark Sullivan
I think that John and follow-up on Mike’s questions too is the in terms of the capital ratios and the favorable impact here and so forth, as we took out there is no need to raise capital anytime in the foreseeable future. We stay well above well-capitalized and the only caveat on that obviously if we did a major acquisition on the asset management side that would obviously change things.
John Moran
Okay, understood. And then just as a follow-up on the PB side of things. The pricing on that product, I think last time we caught up was LIBOR plus 2%, 2.25%. Has that held steady? And do see anything changing there?
Mark Sullivan
Yes that’s remained relatively constant between 2 and 2.25. And just so the answered the asked the question to give everybody a sense of what we are seeing in the market in general with commercial real estate it’s running around two to three over LIBOR and a commercial, industrial running around two to 2 and 3.25. Now obviously the portfolios themselves are yielding higher because they have some legacy loans like the C&I portfolio is around 3.5% over LIBOR and the commercial real estate portfolios around 3.40% and private banking is around, little over 2.50% over LIBOR. 
John Moran
Great, thanks. I have a got a couple more but I will jump back in. Thanks.
Mark Sullivan
Okay, thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Bryce Rowe of Baird. Please go ahead.
Bryce Rowe
Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on the asset management deal. It looks really nice.
Jim Getz
Good morning Bryce. Thank you.
Bryce Rowe
You're welcome. Jim, I just had one follow-up to comments in the press release about the specific reserve added onto non-performing loans. Can you tell me, potentially what that added specific reserve was in terms of dollars?
Jim Getz
Yes I certainly can. There were two loans, and one loan was a manufacturer of a highly-engineered products used in liquid and gas separation processes serving a wide range of markets including chemical, power generation, waste, oil and gas and our exposure in that loan is a little over – or I’d say actually about $3.9 million and the reserve to specific reserve increase was $993,762. And the other one was a designer marketer branded niche products for exercise equipment and travel accessories and gift markets and that is an exposure of about $5.5 million and we put $2.7 million against that. And essentially what we did is on the real estate recovery that I alluded to, we just moved that over and kept it within the loan loss reserve so it offset it.
Bryce Rowe
That's helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.
Jim Getz
Great, thanks Bryce.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matt Schultise of Benning. Please go ahead.
Matt Schultise
Hi good morning.
Jim Getz
Good morning Matt.
Matt Schultise
A couple of small questions. With regard to your buying out of the options effectively. Does that affect your share count going forward? For diluted EPS?
Mark Sullivan
It reduces on the fully diluted count it reduces it. And the same time with the increase in the stock price in the past couple of months that puts more into play on the both vested and unvested, and restricted shares. So it’s coming out about a wash.

Matt Schultise
Okay thank you.
Mark Sullivan
It’s fully diluted around 28 million to 120 million.
Matt Schultise
Okay. And with regard to the five parcels that you mentioned earlier that are now in OREO. Can you share with us the general geography of those?
Jim Getz
General geography in the Mid-Atlantic states were specific Ohio.
Matt Schultise
Okay. Thank you.
Mark Sullivan
And keep in mind that we put that – we’ve been working out that loan since 2009 as we put it on in 2007 and we really stayed with it and it was written down and everything and it went through all kinds of litigation and it was just two weeks ago that we got titled to it. But in the interim we came up with a creative idea over the past couple years of selling off the parcels and keeping them on in Escrow during the litigation. And that’s what caused the cash and now we have moved it all over to OREO and that's why the increase in OREO.
Matt Schultise
Understood, thank you.
Mark Sullivan
Sure.
Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Matt Olney
Hey thanks. Just want to go back to the asset manager and ask about the flows. I think there have been pretty good over – through most of this year, but the flows did reverse course in 3Q. Anything you can point to on the third quarter? And then what's the outlook there?
Tim Riddle
Matt this is Tim Riddle. We had had tremendous fortune in terms of not only new business, but also net flows. We had a couple of client losses in the third quarter, they did in the third quarter, we’ve known about them for a while, but again, we think those will certainly be offset by some of our fortune in being able to continue to distribute not only on the retail side, but also on the institutional side. We believe we've got a lot of open field ahead of us in some very strong products with good prospects in terms of their performance.
Mark Sullivan
Keep in mind what I alluded to in the script earlier that since March of 2014 we've had organic growth of $1.1 billion as of 9/30 so it is fairly substantial in a market where most people have been experiencing net redemptions. But we’re not happy about what happened in the quarter, but in reality if you look at a longer perspective other than the quarter has been pretty positive.
Tim Riddle
Yes Matt just one more item on that. Remember that’s the institutional business is very lumpy. And we’ve had tremendous amount of luck long-term and good fortune and a lot of that is obviously based upon performance but it is also the quality of our institutional marketing efforts now being paired with an equally high quality retail effort. So again, on the institutional side it will be a little lumpy but we certainly have some things we believe that are in the queue and we would expect to see continued growth on the institutional side. And perhaps even a bit of a surprise in the fourth quarter, as well.
Matt Olney
I understood. Thanks for that. And also wanted to ask Mark about the operating expenses. I think that it was a little bit higher than we expected a few months ago. And then you can point to in the third quarter and then what’s the outlook for operating expenses from here?
Mark Sullivan
Good point Matt. There were elevated cost in that quarter, professional fees, FDIC insurance and incentive comp were a little higher. Incentive comp was the third quarter loan growth $177 million annualized that's over $700 million. So we had to adjust based on loan growth on the incentive comp.
Matt Olney
And Mark any thoughts about the operating expenses from here?
Mark Sullivan
I think you will see them pretty much in line with Q3. Perhaps slight increase, but not to the degree – remember Killen was only in the mix for two months in Q1 and has the full three months in Q3, so that's part of the elevation so when you go from Q3 to Q4 you won't see the increase that you saw Q2 to Q3.

Matt Olney
And then Mark you have the amount of the swap fee income recognized in the third quarter?
Mark Sullivan
Yes, the swap fees were just under a million, 970 something thousand and that was on to Q1, on to Q2 and just under a million in Q3. So about 3.4 million year-to-date compared to 1.6 million all of 2015. And the fourth quarter pipeline continues on pace, as well.
Matt Olney
Thank you.
Operator
The next question is a follow-up from John Moran of Macquarie, please go ahead.
John Moran
Hey thanks. So if I'm doing the math right on the Aberdeen assets at looks like the fee rate on those is kind of just under 20 basis point. Wondering if you could give us a split of what’s institutional versus retail there and where you think you might be able to drive that kind of as you get distribution sort of ramped up?
Tim Riddle
Absolutely John this is Tim Riddle. John, you are right, the fee on the total Aberdeen book is just under 20 basis points and that represents a 100% institutional business. And we would expect John that any growth at least in the short term and any new business prospects there would be on the institutional side. And longer-term we would see some potential on the retail side, as well.
John Moran
Okay got it. And then Tim, and Jim and Mark, I guess too just if you could refresh us in terms of what you guys might be looking to add in terms of product capability on the asset management side? I think tax-free is still a whole and then international if there’s anything else that you guys are kind of hoped around for?
Mark Sullivan
Yes, John the one hope and clear right in our face is the tax-free. And Time and I continue to pursue that aggressively and we’ve been to a lot of parties, but we have nothing near term that we can indicate to you. But it’s really necessary and that will pretty well fill it out. We do have an interest in international, that’s going to be a more of a longer-term perspective. But I would say that once we make a tax exempt situation, come about that in fact we will be pretty well done from the acquisition standpoint. We have just have to get everything acclimated and begin to see consequential organic growth that we expect we will. But it’s – we now have critical mass that’s a $15 billion company, at this point it was $7.7 billion, when we acquired it.
John Moran
Yes and it has been a good string of deals here. Thanks very much.
Mark Sullivan
Thank you.
Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Getz for any closing remarks.
Jim Getz

Our Story








How We Began
TriState Capital began with an idea and an opportunity.
Trends over three decades left a large class of banking clients underserved: middle-market businesses, executives and high-net-worth individuals. On one end of the industry, mergers had multiplied the megabanks focused on the corporate and mass consumer markets. On the other end, local banks sprang up to make small business loans and consumer mortgages. This hollowing-out of the industry reduced the number of medium-sized and regional institutions to serve that middle market.
Our founders saw an opportunity. To address the unmet needs of this middle market client base, they decided to combine the capabilities of a large financial institution with the personalized service of a smaller bank, in the primary markets of Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey.
They built their new bank from the ground up for this sole purpose. They created an institution with the philosophy, the people, the processes and the products to successfully serve this specific group of clients.
They designed their venture with a community spirit, but money-center strengths. They created a full suite of customized banking solutions. And they assembled a team of professionals with a deep understanding of banking and business to serve their clients as trusted advisors: Professionals with both the knowledge and the power to act.
The result is TriState Capital Bank. We offer commercial and industrial banking, commercial real estate expertise, treasury management and private banking to middle-market businesses and their owners, as well as to clients of family offices and wealth management firms. Our client relationships are built on trust. We don’t overpromise. We deliver on commitments. We have no retail branches. Instead, we offer the personal attention and know-how to provide the financial solutions our clients need for their businesses and personal affairs. Plus, we offer all the convenience of modern finance with the technology our clients expect of a full-service bank.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
