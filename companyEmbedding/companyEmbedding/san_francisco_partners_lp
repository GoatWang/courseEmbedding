Method Products

Method Products is a homecare company that was formed with the goal of transforming the household cleaner from a toxic object that hides under the sink, to an all-natural, biodegradable, and stylish countertop accessory. Through design, fragrance, and wit, the company elevates mundane household goods to objects that provide consumers with sensory and aesthetic pleasure.
The company’s product line started with all-purpose cleaners and rapidly expanded to include kitchen soaps, specialty cleaners and wipes, hand and body personal care items, laundry detergents, and air care.
Method has products available at national and regional outlets, including Target, Lowe’s, Whole Foods, and Safeway, as well as leading global retailers Tesco, Sainsbury, Waitrose, and others.
SFEP exited Method via a sale to a strategic aquirer.
Website: www.methodhome.com

SFEP’s strategic relationships and insights were extraordinarily helpful to us as we grew our company and brand across retailers and geographies.
Eric Ryan, Co-Founder Method Products, Inc.



Yes To

Yes To develops innovative, natural, fun, and efficacious beauty and personal care products that are free of all the “nasties” and filled with all the “goodies.”
Yes To’s initial product line, Yes To Carrots, brought to market a new concept in skin and hair care that combines the anti-oxidant power of Beta Carotene from orange organic fruits and vegetables, with the purifying and moisturizing properties of 26 Dead Sea Minerals. Yes To’s product line has expanded to include Yes To Tomatoes for oily/combination skin, Yes To Cucumbers for normal to sensitive skin, Yes To Blueberries for age renewal, Yes To Grapefruit for uneven skin, and Yes To Coconuts for dry skin.
Yes To products can be found at Walgreens, Target, CVS, Safeway, Ulta, and Walmart, as well as several leading international retailers.
