Frequently Bought Together









Product Overview





			            Tying Twine has minimal stretch and holds knots well making it ideal for packaging or bundling. It is mildew resistant, rot proof, resists oil, water and most chemicals. Warning: Avoid using a knot; splicing is preferable. Knots reduce the strength of the rope up to 50%. Do not use this product for overhead lifting, support of human weight or athletic equipment, or other situations where personal safety or valuable property can be endangered. The working loads shown should never be exceeded. Additional care must be exercised when using this product under shock (stress, jerk) conditions. These conditions can reduce working loads by as much as 33%. Never stand in line with rope under tension; such a rope, particularly nylon rope, may recoil (snap back). Never use this product to secure large flat surfaces or objects, which could airplane or dislodge through buildup of air pressure. All ropes should be replaced if signs of wear, such as broken fibers, are apparent. Misuse can result in serious injury or death.

Pest Control from Amazon.comDon’t let insects and rodents win; fight back and reclaim your home with various pest control options if your insect, rodent, or animal infestation is spiraling out of control.From liquid ant baits to live ladybugs to electronic insect swatters, Amazon.com offers a wide variety of pest control supplies and options. For rodents and other animal pests, depending on whether they’re wanted dead or alive, you have many options. Live animal cage traps work great for small outdoor rodents like chipmunks, squirrels, and weasels as well as indoor mice and rats. For quick traps, we offer a wide range of electronic or snap mouse traps that instantly get the rodent. For larger animals, try an ultrasonic animal repellant or a motion-activated sprinkle to startle and scare them away. Sorted into convenient categories, you can search by type of pest, featured brands, and price to find the perfect solution to your problem. You can also read product reviews right on the page from other customers to see how effective pest control can be.Get insects under control with pest control for ants, mosquitos, spiders, and other creepy crawlers. Hang an electric lantern or lure outside that will attract and kill flying insects like mosquitoes and biting flies. Natural and chemical repellent sprays, powders, and dust will stop bugs on your plants, in your water, and from forming colonies. If you’re worried about chemicals in the air, live pest control like ladybugs, praying mantises, and nematodes actively seek out and eat insects like aphids and mealy bugs.The fight against insects, animals, and rodents ends here: take a stand with pest control from Amazon.com, your 24/7 online ally.

                            Product Details
                        

                            The generous capacity of the Samsung 6500 Series 7.5 Cu. Ft. Electric Dryer means more clothes and fewer loads. The larger capacity size will free up your time from doing laundry to instead do the things you love. Fourteen cycles and 5 temperature settings ensure you'll find the most effective and efficient operation for all variety of laundry tasks. The power of steam is unleashed with Multi-Steam. This system helps remove wrinkles and odors, and freshen clothes, though without having to manually refill a water reservoir like other, more conventional dryers. This is also going to cut down on your time spent ironing. No need to interrupt your drying cycle by feeling clothes for optimal dryness. Samsung employs sensors to do this for you. Moisture sensors detect when laundry has reached the right level of dryness, then automatically shuts off the machine to save you energy. This also helps protect your clothing against heat damage.Features:• 6500 Series 7.5 Cu. Ft. Electric Dryer- White• Energy Star 2016 certified• 14 preset drying cycles• 5 temperature settings• 5 dry levels• Sensor dry technology• Multi-Steam technology• Eco dry option• Stainless steel drum• Dryer drum light• Reversible see-through door• Smart care function• Child lock•Filter check indicator
