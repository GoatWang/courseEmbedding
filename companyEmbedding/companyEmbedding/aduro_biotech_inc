An Emerging Leader in Cancer Immunotherapy | Aduro Biotech



















Pioneering Immunotherapy.
Transforming Lives.


About Us







Aduro is dedicated to its mission to discover, develop, and commercialize immunotherapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer.

To fulfill its mission, the company is advancing several leading-edge proprietary technologies that are designed to initiate and sustain the immune system to mobilize and attack tumors. Collectively, Aduro’s three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth.
Product candidates from Aduro’s LADD (live, attenuated double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes), STING Pathway Activators, and B-select monoclonal antibody platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other cutting-edge immunotherapies. This diverse set of technology platforms has led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being evaluated in a number of cancer indications. Additionally, Aduro’s platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.
Aduro collaborates and partners with leading academic investigators, along with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in an effort to develop its technologies in an expeditious manner and make new therapies available to patients in need.

An Emerging Leader in Cancer Immunotherapy | Aduro Biotech



















Pioneering Immunotherapy.
Transforming Lives.


About Us







Aduro is dedicated to its mission to discover, develop, and commercialize immunotherapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer.

To fulfill its mission, the company is advancing several leading-edge proprietary technologies that are designed to initiate and sustain the immune system to mobilize and attack tumors. Collectively, Aduro’s three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth.
Product candidates from Aduro’s LADD (live, attenuated double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes), STING Pathway Activators, and B-select monoclonal antibody platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other cutting-edge immunotherapies. This diverse set of technology platforms has led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being evaluated in a number of cancer indications. Additionally, Aduro’s platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.
Aduro collaborates and partners with leading academic investigators, along with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in an effort to develop its technologies in an expeditious manner and make new therapies available to patients in need.

The Company focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that manage the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. The Company's product candidates from its Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes, Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) Pathway Activator, and B-select monoclonal antibody platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation), as well as other immunotherapies. Its LADD technology platform is being developed as a treatment for multiple indications, including mesothelioma, ovarian, gastric, lung and prostate cancers. Its LADD product candidate is CRS-207, which is being developed as a treatment for multiple indications, including mesothelioma, ovarian, and gastric cancers. ADU-214 and ADU-741 are product candidates in development for lung and prostate cancers, respectively. A personalized form of LADD (pLADD) is being developed utilizing tumor neoantigens that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.The STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular STING receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is a STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is being evaluated in a Phase I study in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Its B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes an ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with binding properties against a range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The B-select platform has delivered various immune modulating assets in research and preclinical development. It is developing a pipeline of product candidates on its own and have a number of collaborations with global pharmaceutical companies to expand its products and technology platforms.The Company has developed LADD product candidates in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. targeting lung and prostate cancers and it is developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under its worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. In addition, it is developing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the potential to yield immunotherapy combinations through its subsidiary, Aduro Biotech Holdings, Europe B.V., known as Aduro Biotech Europe, based in the Netherlands. It is using CRS-207 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for treatment in the front line-setting of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. It has completed two Phase II trials in pancreatic cancer with CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas.ADU-214 is a bivalent LADD product candidate expressing EGFRvIII and mesothelin. It has initiated Phase I study, which evaluates intravenous administration of ADU-214 in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. ADU-741 is a LADD product candidate engineered to express multiple antigens. It has initiated the Phase I trial, which evaluates intravenous administration of ADU-741 in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Its STING Pathway Activator product candidate, ADU-S100, with modifications to the mammalian cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) structure is designed to optimize stability, STING receptor binding affinity and potency. Its anti- A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL) antibody is its B-select mAb, which is being developed as a therapy for multiple myeloma. CD27 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on different immune cells, such as T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells and dendritic cells. Its CTLA-4 antibody is being advanced through pre-clinical development and it is conducting IND-enabling studies.The Company competes with AstraZeneca PLC, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Incyte Corporation, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd, Sanofi SA, Advaxis, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc. and Visterra, Inc.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.
