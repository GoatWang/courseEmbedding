Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2014-C19 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2014-C19
    





March 05, 2015 10:29 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2014-C19. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. Fitch reviewed the most recently available financial 
      performance data for the transaction, as well as updated rent rolls for 
      the majority of the top 15 loans, which represent 47% of the 
      transaction. Of the loans in the pool, 70 loans (78%) of the pool 
      reported third quarter (3Q 2014) financials; 12 loans (11%) reported (2Q 
      2014) financials; 17 loans (11%) have not reported financials since 
      issuance.
    

      As of the February 2015 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 1% to $1.09 billion from $1.1 
      billion at issuance. Fitch has designated three (1.5%) Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, and no loans are in special servicing.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, Renaissance Downtown Chicago (8.2% of the 
      pool) is secured by a 27-story, 553-room, full-service hotel located in 
      Chicago, IL situated in the central portion of Downtown Chicago, within 
      walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and 
      most of Chicago's CBD businesses. The property was built in 1991, 
      renovated in 2012 and features three food and beverage outlets, 35,000 
      square feet (sf) of meeting space, a 10,640-sf grand ballroom, a spa, 
      fitness center, indoor swimming pool, 7,800 sf of street-level retail 
      space, an underground parking garage (space for 80 valet-parked 
      vehicles), a business center and VIP Club Lounge. Per the January 2015 
      Smith Travel Research (STR) report, occupancy was 73.3%, the average 
      daily rate (ADR) $237.08, and revenue per available room (RevPAR) of 
      $173.83 compared to 74.8%, $212.62, $159.13 for its competitive set. The 
      most recent debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) as of September 2014 is 
      2.63x up from 2.12x at issuance.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool, Life Time Fitness Portfolio (7.1% 
      of the pool) is secured by a portfolio of five freestanding fitness 
      center properties all 100% occupied by Life Time Fitness. The properties 
      are located in Texas, Virginia, Illinois, and Arizona with no property 
      representing more than 21.5% of the portfolio's aggregate loan balance. 
      The most recent DSCR as of September 2014 is 1.53x compared to 1.68x at 
      issuance.
    

      The third largest loan, Nordic Cold Storage Portfolio (4.9% of the pool) 
      is secured by a portfolio of eight properties totaling 907,304 sf of 
      cold storage warehouse and distribution centers located in Georgia, 
      North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. Seven of the eight properties 
      were built on or before 1995 with the final property being built in 
      2013. The tenant, Nordic Cold Storage, is a provider of refrigerated 
      warehouse services to the poultry industry. The portfolio remains stable 
      with occupancy of 100% and a DSCR of 1.78x which is consistent with 
      issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust, Series 2014-C19' (June 12, 2014) 
      available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$64.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$98.9 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$210 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$249.2 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$101.9 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$73.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-B at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$75.9 million class B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40 million class C* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$189 million class PEX* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27.6 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for a related amount 
      of class PEX certificates, and class PEX certificates may be exchanged 
      for class A-S, B and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the $44.1 
      million class G certificates.
    

      A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement (RW&E) mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset 
      class is available in the following report:
    

      --'WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust, Series 2014-C19'-- Appendix' (June 
      12, 2014).

Item 2. Legal Proceedings                                                   

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas has furnished the Depositor with the   
following information regarding legal proceedings with respect to Deutsche  
Bank Trust Company Americas:                                                

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") has been named as a defendant
in civil litigation concerning its role as trustee of certain residential   
mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts. On June 18, 2014, a group of    
 investors filed a civil action against DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company ("DBNTC") in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of  
and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for   
alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of       
contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBTCA's and      
DBNTC's alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. 
An amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014, adding five plaintiffs and 
15 RMBS trusts to the action. DBTCA is reviewing these newly-filed          
pleadings.                                                                  

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. has furnished the Depositor with the following       
information regarding legal proceedings with respect to Wells Fargo Bank,   
N.A.:                                                                       

On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil          
complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,   
against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276        
residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts. The complaint is one
of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees     
(Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by     
 certain of the institutional investor plaintiffs. The complaint against Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. alleges the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts 
causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's purported    
  failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged
  breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality, failure to
notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by   
breaches by mortgage loan servicers and purported failure to abide by       
appropriate standards of care following events of default. Relief sought    
includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of certain   
expenses and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action
have previously been filed against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and other trustees
by RMBS investors in other transactions.                                    

There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the      
 possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However,
  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its
  obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the
cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it   
intends to contest the plaintiffs' claims vigorously.                       

Item 9. Exhibits.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
