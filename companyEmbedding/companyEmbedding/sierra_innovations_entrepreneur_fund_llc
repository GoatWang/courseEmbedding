About Us






THREE DECADES of experience.
Over $1.9 BILLION invested.
Since 1982, Sierra has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs around the world begin and grow successful technology companies. Our passion is finding the right combination of innovative technology and talented entrepreneurs, and guiding them with expertise and capital to help companies grow and deliver on their promise. Together with our vast network of successful entrepreneurs, Fortune 1000 CIOs, operational executives and deep domain experts across many areas, let us help you build the next great technology company.  

Investing In The Future of The Enterprise





The History of Big Data Value
Well before the term “big data” was used, we were already investing in companies finding new value in massive datasets with Teradata and Greenplum. We followed with companies cracking the formula on the next wave of big data opportunity: delivering enterprise analytic applications, like Alpine Data Labs, and creating value in key vertical industries, like Adometry (media) and RUNA (eCommerce). We’re thrilled to have been there at the beginning of one of the most disruptive enterprise opportunities in over a century — and be investing now in the next era.




The Future of Mobile
The market has only just begun to tap the opportunity of the massive shift to mobile—and Sierra Ventures portfolio companies are paving the way for a new era of mobile innovation. AuthenTec, one of Apple’s biggest mergers in its 36 year history, is widely expected to drive a new era for the bellwether company with its mobile security technologies. InvenSense is making it possible to interface with electronic devices through motions in free space. And Appcelerator is fundamentally changing the app development processes of this new era.




The Genesis of Tomorrow’s Cloud
Back at the turn of this century, when SaaS was still called ASP, we were investing with Frontbridge, a pioneer in anti-spam SaaS acquired by Microsoft. We followed with Makara, one of the pioneers in PaaS (acquired by Red Hat), and the leading SaaS CRM provider in China, 800Apps. Before the conversation has shifted to optimizing and simplifying virtual infrastructure, we were investing in this enterprise future with companies ranging from DynamicOps (acquired by VMware) and Opalis Software (acquired by Microsoft)—to emerging disrupters like ElasticBox.




The Core of Today’s Infrastructure
Over two decades ago, Sierra Ventures invested in Stratacom, which later became the core of Cisco’s networking infrastructure. From IBM’s acquisition of Micromuse to Eltek’s acquisition of Valere, which formed one of the world’s largest data center power systems providers, our portfolio companies have helped drive the infrastructure of a new era. Now, a changing landscape is bringing other Sierra investments to the forefront, like Sourcefire, acquired by Cisco for $2.7 Billion dollars, and Ooyala, harnessing and monetizing today’s exponential growth in video content.




What’s Next?
We believe that the future of the enterprise is approaching fast—and will be driven by emerging, disruptive technologies like the ones we are investing in today. Transformational innovation in key verticals; the introduction of gamification technologies into the enterprise; social with real impact; the application of chemistry and physics to disrupt mobile and power industries—there are just some of the areas where we seek, study and invest in the future of the enterprise.





Investing Globally
SPOTLIGHT: INDIA & CHINA – Growing Emerging Economies
Sierra Ventures is an active, early-stage investor in India and China. The Firm has invested successfully in India and China since 2006. As the emerging markets of India and China continue to grow at a pace nearly double the pace of developed markets, they create significant investment opportunities. Our investment focus for these regions includes domestic consumer solutions, advanced technology and enterprise class services offerings.

Mark FernandesManaging Director


Mark Fernandes
Managing Director

“My first VC investment was in an open source (long before it was popular) security company. It was an absolute thrill to help build Sourcefire from a small team of developers in Maryland, to its IPO and then a $2.7B acquisition by Cisco. As an investor I have to play many roles and adapt with the entrepreneurs to the many ups-and-downs, but the theme stays the same – let’s do what it takes to build a great company together.”

Mark began his career as part of the founding team of a display company, followed by product roles at Seagate and Cisco. After his MBA, he then spent four years as a research analyst covering the software sector at Robertson Stephens and Merrill Lynch. He joined Sierra in 2002 and focuses primarily on software. Some of his prior investments include Sourcefire (IPO; M&A - Cisco $2.7B), Frontbridge and Opalis (M&A - Microsoft) and DynamicOps (M&A - VMware). Mark holds a BS from Mangalore University (India), a MS from UC Berkeley, and a MBA from Harvard University.

Tim GuleriManaging Director


Tim Guleri
Managing Director

“It takes blood, sweat and tears to build a company...it is a journey I have been on personally as an entrepreneur.  At a very visceral level I feel fortunate and humbled to support the visionary entrepreneurs I meet every day.  I relish being a resource for my CEOs—the ‘doctor on call’ as they go through the ups and downs of building a successful company. I'm 24x7, like my entrepreneurs.”

A serial entrepreneur, Tim built two software infrastructure companies: Scopus Technology, which went public in 1995, and Octane Software, where he was Founder/CEO which he sold to Epiphany for $3.2 billion in 2000. In 2002 he became a Managing Director at Sierra. At Sierra, he's taken two companies public, Sourcefire (FIRE) and MakeMyTrip (MMYT), and has been responsible for several M&As. Tim holds a BA in Electrical Engineering from India and an MS in IEOR/Robotics from Virginia Tech. His passion (outside of his family and companies) is soccer.

Ben Yu

“Throughout my career, I've been fascinated by unique technologies. As an investor, my passion is to help entrepreneurs turn these great technologies into successful products that the world has not seen before, creating new categories—and new market leaders. I am very fortunate to have been involved in countless "world first" products from my portfolio companies, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. My job is to pass on this experience to entrepreneurs, and help them build companies that will become the next market leader.”

Innovation Venture Fund




NYU's seed-stage venture capital fund invests exclusively in startups founded by, and/or commercializing technologies and intellectual property developed by, current NYU students, faculty, and researchers.
Learn more about our investment criteria below.
To request a meeting with our team and be considered for funding, submit a venture profile.
SUBMIT PROFILE



















                                            Tell Me More                                            




	    	
Created in 2010, the NYU Innovation Venture Fund supports the University's efforts to convert research into patentable inventions. In two decades, over 100 startups have been built on NYU discoveries and innovations.


	    	
The Fund makes approximately five to six investments per year in partnership with other investors and/or venture capital firms. The Fund will recycle investment returns from the successful sale of portfolio companies back into the University to finance further research and future ventures.







                                            Criteria & Guidelines                                            




	    	
This opportunity is open to startups founded by current students, faculty, and researchers at any NYU school, college, or institute.
 
The Fund seeks early stage businesses with inventions, discoveries, products or services that were developed in whole or in part at NYU, that have achieved proof of concept (or a prototype) and are ready for commercial product development. The fund does not invest in projects requiring further basic research.


	    	
The Fund will consider proposals using the following evaluation criteria:

Technology has achieved proof of concept or prototype and is ready for commercial product development
Technology has important and sustainable points of differentiation
Identifiable customer(s) with a compelling value proposition
Viable regulatory approval and reimbursement strategy, if applicable
Market able to sustain $50 million/yr revenues within 5 yrs of market entry
Logical mechanism for transferring key know-how and IP
Investment required for exit is in the $1s or $10s of millions, not $100s
Business capable of generating venture scale returns (5-10x return on invested capital)
Founders with key skills & experience committed to venture success

Don’t worry if you don’t know if you meet all the criteria laid out above. We will help you more fully assess the merits of your opportunity and connect you with the resources you need to progress your venture. Please reach out to us if you’re considering raising seed capital.

Description


What drives innovation and entrepreneurship in India, China, and the United States? Our data-rich and evidence-based exploration of relationships among innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth yields theoretical models of economic growth in the context of macroeconomic factors. Because we know far too little about the key characteristics of Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs and the ways they innovate, our balanced, systematic comparison of entrepreneurship and innovation results in a new approach to looking at economic growth that can be used to model empirical data from other countries. The importance of innovation and entrepreneurship to any economy has been recognized since the pioneering work of Joseph Schumpeter. Our analysis of the major factors that affect innovation and entrepreneurship in these three parts of the world – US, China and India –provides a comprehensive view of their effects and their likely futures.




Key Features



Looks at elements important for innovation and entrepreneurship and compares them against each other within the three countries
Places theoretical modeling of economic growth in the context of the overall macroeconomic factors
Explores questions about the relationships among innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth in China, India and the US.




Readership


Upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals working in international finance, business, and economic development

These issues are addressed in these essays which remind us that the future has already started."--Daniele Archibugi, Italian National Research Council
