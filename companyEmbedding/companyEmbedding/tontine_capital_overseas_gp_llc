Distressed Debt Investing



This blog will try to dissect distressed debt investing, up and down the capital structure.  We will look at current distressed debt situations, try to explain the ins and outs of how decisions are made in the distressed debt world, probably rant a few times about positions that are working against me, and hopefully enlighten some readers.

Distressed Debt Hedge Funds





This week, I was sent a paper by Jongha Lim, a PHD student at Ohio State, entitled The Role of Activist Hedge Funds in Distressed Firms.  In my opinion this is one of the best academic papers addressing distressed debt and distressed debt investing this year.  I reached out to Jongha and we will be doing an interview with him in the coming weeks.  Fascinating piece of work.With that said, Jongha compiled a list of all funds participating in distressed debt and he is allowing me to use his data here.   And if you would like to add yourself or another name to the list, please email me.

Great paper. Thanks for the post. Curious, is the fulcrum point simply when libailities exceed equity, or when dollar cost of debt exceeds dollar equity?
