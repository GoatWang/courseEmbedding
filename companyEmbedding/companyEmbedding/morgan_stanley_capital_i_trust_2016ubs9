                    Global Credit Research - 24 Feb 2017
                







Approximately $510.0 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, February 24, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed seven classes of Morgan Stanley 
Capital I Trust 2016-UBS9, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2016-UBS9 as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 
11, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE 




The ratings on the six investment-grade P&I classes were affirmed 
because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within 
acceptable ranges.




The rating on the IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.2% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
Securities" published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 17, 
the same as at securitization.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure and property type. Moody's also further adjusts 
these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan 
level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the February 17, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% to 
$662.5 million from $666.6 million at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 31 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top 
ten loans constituting 69% of the pool. One loan, 
constituting 8.5% of the pool, has an investment-grade 
structured credit assessment.




Three loans, constituting 7.3% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool, and there are no loans 
in special servicing.




Moody's received partial year 2016 operating results for 61% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 109%, 
compared to 110% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 0.5% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.9%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.59X and 1.00X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the GLP Industrial Portfolio 
B Loan ($56.0 million -- 8.5% of the 
pool), which is secured by a pari passu portion of a $629 
million senior loan. The asset is also structured with $335.3 
million of subordinate secured debt and $330.0 million of 
mezzanine debt. The loan is secured by the borrower's fee 
interest in 142 industrial properties located within 19 distinct MSA's 
across 11 states. Construction dates range between 1967 and 2015 
and reflect an average age of 15 years. Property subtypes include 
warehouse/distribution (86.2% of net rentable area), 
light industrial (10.6% of net rentable area) and flex (3.2% 
of net rentable area). The portfolio's weighted average occupancy 
rate was 100%, compared to 94% at securitization. 
Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa (sca.pd) 
and 1.72X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The top three conduit loans represent 27% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the 525 Seventh Avenue Loan ($62.0 million 
-- 9.4% of the pool), which represents a pari 
passu interest in a $176 million mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by a 24-story, Class-B office building 
located at the intersection of 7th avenue and 38th Street in the garment 
district within Midtown Manhattan. Property improvements contain 
approximately 490,900 square feet (SF) of office space and 14,380 
SF of retail space with the retail units having street-level frontage 
along both Seventh Avenue and 38th Street. As of August 2015, 
the property was 96% occupied by 92 tenants. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 103% and 0.89X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the U Haul AREC RW Portfolio Loan ($60.6 
million -- 9.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by 19 self-storage facilities located across 12 states and the 
District of Columbia with a total of 7,341 units (617,047 
SF) and 285 RV parking spaces. The portfolio also contains 243 
U-Box units, portable storage containers that are used for 
moving and storage. The properties were constructed between 1955 
and 2004. As of September 2016, the portfolio was 89% 
leased, essentially the same as at securitization. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 103% and 1.08X, respectively, 
compared to 106% and 1.06X at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 2100 Ross Loan ($59.1 million 
-- 8.9% of the pool), which represents a pari 
passu interest in a $96.5 million mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by a 33-story, 843,730 SF Class 
A office building located in the Dallas Arts District within the Central 
Business District of Dallas, Texas. The property is adjacent 
to the Dallas Museum of Art, Nasher Sculpture Center and the Morton 
H. Meyerson Symphony Center. The 2100 Ross Property is connected 
via Sky bridge to Chase Tower and is across from the Plaza of the Americas 
and within two blocks of the East Transfer Center DART rail station. 
Amenities include below-grade parking featuring 474 parking spaces, 
24 hour security, on-site property management, conference 
center, fitness center, three restaurants/cafés, 
dry cleaning service, auto detail service, optometrist, 
dentist, and massage therapy. As of September 2016, 
the property was 84% leased, compared to 86% at securitization. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 130% and 0.81X, 
respectively, compared to 132% and 0.80X at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

Approximately $514.1 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, March 11, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned definitive ratings to seven classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2016-UBS9, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-UBS9:




Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-A*, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-S, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa2 (sf)




* Interest-Only Class




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 31 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 222 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.87X (1.59X excluding 
structured credit assessed loans) is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's Stressed 
DSCR of 1.06X (1.00X excluding structured credit assessed 
loans) is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average 
of 0.92X.




The Trust loan balance of $666.6 million represents a Moody's 
LTV ratio of 104.9%, which is lower than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%. Excluding 
one loan with assigned Structured Credit Assessments, the Trust 
loan balance of $610.6 million represents a Moody's 
LTV ratio of 109.7%. When including subordinate debt, 
the Moody's LTV ratio is 110.8%. Excluding 
one loan with assigned Structured Credit Assessments, the Moody's 
LTV ratio is 111.4%.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The weighted average 
Moody's Quality Grade for the pool is 2.30, which is 
on par with most recently rated pools, and is an indication that 
the real estate quality of the underlying assets is average relative to 
the CMBS 2.0 universe. Typical Moody's rated conduit 
pools during 2015 year to date exhibit an average grade of 2.35.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 17.4 (16.6 
excluding structured credit assessed loans), which is below the 
scores calculated for most multi-borrower pools that Moody's 
has rated since 2009. Accounting for loans made to a common borrower 
represented in the pool, Moody's borrower level Herfindahl 
score is slightly lower at 20.0 (16.8 excluding structured 
credit assessed loans).




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 24.2 (20.3 excluding structured 
credit assessed loans), which is significantly lower than the 1Q2015 
average of 37.5. The pool contains five loans (23.8% 
of the pool balance) that are secured by multiple properties. Loans 
secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility 
given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment another's 
cash flow to meet debt service requirements. These loans also benefit 
from the pooling of equity from each underlying property.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance. 
Moody's analysis also uses the CMBS IO calculator, which references 
the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the 
published methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit 
assessments; original and current bond balances grossed up for losses 
for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and 
IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5.0%, 
14.3%, and 22.8%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated Aaa (sf) Super Senior classes would be 
Aaa, Aa1, and Aa3, respectively; for the Aa2 (sf) 
rated Class A-S the ratings would be Aa3, A1, and Baa1, 
respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure 
how the rating of the security might migrate over time; rather they 
are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial 
rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating 
process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has not aged. 
Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario 
from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. Qualitative 
factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF428091.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                    Global Credit Research - 18 Feb 2016
                







Approximately $514.1 million of Structured Securities Affected

NOTE: On March 3, 2016 the Press Release was corrected as follows: “Provisional” was inserted in the headline and the first sentence. Additionally, in the debt list, the “(P)”
designation was added in front of each respective rating. Revised release follows.

New York, February 18, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned Provisional ratings to seven classes of CMBS 
securities, issued by MSCI Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 
2016-UBS9.




Cl. A-1, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. X-A, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-S, Assigned (P)Aa2 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 31 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 222 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.87X (1.59X excluding 
structured credit assessed loans) is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's Stressed 
DSCR of 1.06X (1.00X excluding structured credit assessed 
loans) is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average 
of 0.92X.




The Trust loan balance of $666.6 million represents a Moody's 
LTV ratio of 104.9%, which is lower than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%. Excluding 
one loan with assigned Structured Credit Assessments, the Trust 
loan balance of $610.6 million represents a Moody's 
LTV ratio of 109.7%. When including subordinate debt, 
the Moody's LTV ratio is 110.8%. Excluding 
the one loan with assigned Structured Credit Assessments, the Moody's 
LTV ratio including subordinate debt is 111.4%.




The pooled trust benefits from having one loan, totaling $56 
million or 8.4% of the pool balance, which is assigned 
an investment grade structured credit assessment. Moody's assigned 
a Structured Credit Assessment of aaa (sca.pd) to the GLP Industrial 
Portfolio B loan which is secured by 142 cross-collateralized industrial 
properties located across 11 states and 13 different markets with a total 
of approximately 26.2 million SF.




Loans assigned investment-grade structured credit assessments are 
not expected to contribute any loss to a transaction in low stress scenarios, 
but are expected to contribute minimal amounts of losses in high stress 
scenarios. Moody's also considers the creditworthiness of 
loans when considering the effects of loan pooling. The power of 
diversity is inversely correlated with credit quality. As such, 
Structured Credit Assessments assigned an opinion of aaa (sca.pd) 
do not impact a pool's diversity profile when the assessments raise 
or lower the Herfindahl Score.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The weighted average 
Moody's Quality Grade for the pool is 2.30, which is 
on par with most recently rated pools, and is an indication that 
the real estate quality of the underlying assets is average relative to 
the CMBS 2.0 universe. Typical Moody's rated conduit 
pools during 2015 year to date exhibit an average grade of 2.35.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 17.4 (16.6 
excluding structured credit assessed loans), which is below the 
scores calculated for most multi-borrower pools that Moody's 
has rated since 2009. Accounting for loans made to a common borrower 
represented in the pool, Moody's borrower level Herfindahl 
score is slightly lower at 16.8 (20.0 excluding structured 
credit assessed loans).




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 24.2 (20.3 excluding structured 
credit assessed loans), which is significantly lower than the 1Q2015 
average of 37.5. The pool contains five loans (23.8% 
of the pool balance) that are secured by multiple properties. Loans 
secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility 
given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment another's 
cash flow to meet debt service requirements. These loans also benefit 
from the pooling of equity from each underlying property.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance. 
Moody's analysis also uses the CMBS IO calculator, which references 
the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the 
published methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit 
assessments; original and current bond balances grossed up for losses 
for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and 
IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5.0%, 
14.3%, and 22.8%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated (P) Aaa (sf) Super Senior classes would 
be Aaa, Aa1, and Aa3, respectively; for the (P) 
Aa2 (sf) rated Class A-S the ratings would be Aa3, A1, 
and Baa1, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF426533




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2016-UBS9 Com'l Mtge Trust 
      P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





February 16, 2016 10:21 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Morgan Stanley Capital I 
      Trust 2016-UBS9 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$29,800,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$73,500,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46,100,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$192,226,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$466,626,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87,493,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,496,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,997,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,997,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,164,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$14,999,000ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,164,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$14,999,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,666,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Feb. 11, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the interest-only 
      $13,332,000a class X-FG, interest-only $19,998,197a class X-H, 
      $6,666,000a class G or the $19,998,197a class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 31 loans secured by 222 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $666.6 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital 
      Holdings LLC and Bank of America, National Association.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 81.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 94.3%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: The transaction has lower leverage than other 
      Fitch-rated transactions. This pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.23x and LTV of 
      99.7% are better than the 2015 averages of 1.18x, and 109.3%, 
      respectively. Excluding the credit-opinion GLP Industrial Portfolio B 
      loan (8.4% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV are 1.20x and 
      103.6%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The pool is significantly more concentrated 
      than other recent Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 
      loans comprise 68.9% of the pool, higher than the 2015 average of 49.3%. 
      The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) of 575 is greater than the 
      2015 average of 367.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: One loan, GLP Industrial Portfolio 
      B (8.4% of the pool), has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'A+sf' 
      on a stand-alone basis. The loan is secured by 142 industrial properties 
      across 11 states in 13 markets. The sponsor is Global Logistics 
      Properties, Ltd., which is currently rated 'BBB+' by Fitch. Excluding 
      the credit opinion GLP Industrial Portfolio B loan, Fitch's implied 
      conduit subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is approximately 25% 
      and approximately 7.9% at 'BBB-sf'.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSCI 
      2016-UBS9 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      below-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in 
      which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to ' AA-sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. The 
      presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses 
      and sensitivities on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 31 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
