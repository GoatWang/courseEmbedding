The selling stockholders will be selling all of the shares under this prospectus
in the Offering. The proceeds from the sale of the shares will be received
directly by the selling stockholders. We will receive no proceeds from the sale
of these shares offered by selling stockholders under this prospectus.


We face competition from other oil companies in all aspects of our business,
including acquisition of producing properties and oil & gas leases, marketing of
oil & gas, and obtaining goods, services, and labor. Many of our competitors
have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that affect our
ability to acquire producing properties include available funds, available
information about prospective properties, and our standards established for
minimum projected return on investment. Competition is also presented by
alternative fuel sources, including ethanol and other fossil fuels. Because of
our use of EOR techniques and management’s experience and expertise in the oil &
gas industry, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market.
 
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to operate CO2 EOR
techniques, drill wells, and conduct field operations, geologists,
geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil industry can
fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil prices, causing periodic
shortages. There have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment,
as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells
being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for
equipment, services, and personnel. Higher oil prices generally stimulate
increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and
associated supplies, equipment, and services. We cannot be certain when we will
experience these issues and these types of shortages or price increases could
significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow, and operating results, or
restrict our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we
currently have planned and budgeted.


Company Description
We are an independent energy company engaged in the development, production, and
marketing of oil & gas in North America. Our business strategy is to use
secondary and tertiary recovery techniques on older, historically productive
fields with proven in-place oil & gas. Higher oil & gas prices, and


 advances in
technology such as 3-D seismic acquisition and evaluation, waterflood injection,
and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection, should enable us to capitalize on attractive
sources of potentially recoverable oil & gas.

We operate three fields in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, which is located in
the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The fields, acquired in December
2006 and January 2007, are the the Big Muddy Field, the South Glenrock B Field,
and the Cole Creek South Field. All three fields currently produce some oil. We
are currently working to enhance production in our South Glenrock B Field and
Cole Creek South Field, which are both under active waterflood. Subject to
obtaining financing, we plan to substantially increase production in our fields
by further enhancing existing waterflood operations in the Cole Creek South
Field and the South Glenrock B Field, and by commencing waterflood operations in
the Big Muddy Field. We then intend to raise additional funds to fund the
remainder of the Big Muddy waterflood project and to implement our CO2 enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) development plans. To fund the acquisition of the three
fields and our operating expenses, from June 2006 through January 2007, we sold
$89,300,000 of our securities in two private placements. In December 2006, we
also entered into an agreement with the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to supply
us with CO2 needed to conduct CO2 tertiary recovery operations in our three
fields. This agreement is described in Note 2 in the Notes to Financial
Statements of our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2007, which begin on page F-8.

Led by an experienced management team, our long term goal is to enhance
stockholder value by identifying and further developing productive oil & gas
assets across North America, particularly in the Rocky Mountains.

----
Our principal executive offices are located at 999-18th Street, Suite 3400,
Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (303) 629-1125. The
Company's periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) can be found on the Company's website at www.rancherenergy.

Our goal is to drill and produce oil and gas cost effectively, by concentrating our efforts on oil rich areas where we have in-house geologic and operating expertise.

Currently, T-Rex Oil, Inc. has acquired producing wells and leases in Wyoming and Nebraska and is actively pursing other expansion opportunities in the established basins of the Rocky Mountain Region.The Company’s goal is to build steady, sustainable growth of its inventory of its inventory of oil and gas properties.

T-Rex Oil, Inc. Announces Closing Of Western Interior Oil & Gas, Inc. Acquisition

Apr 08, 2015, 09:56 ET
		  		  					
						 from   T-Rex Oil, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BROOMFIELD, Colo., April 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- T-Rex Oil, Inc. (OTC: TRXO) ("TRXO" or the "Company"), an independent energy company with a focus on the Rocky Mountain region announced on Friday March 27, 2015 it completed the previously announced acquisition contract of Western Interior Oil & Gas, Inc. ("WIOG"), a Wyoming corporation through an exchange for 83% of the issued and outstanding stock of WIOG for 7,470,000 restricted common shares of TRXO. The additional 17% of WIOG is being negotiated for 1,530,000 shares and will result in a total of 9,000,000 TRXO shares having been issued. As a result of the transaction, TRXO will assume ownership and operatorship of all of WIOG operated properties and leases in Wyoming.
Key attributes of WIOG properties include the following:

Approximately 15,895 gross (8,643 net) acres located in Big Horn, Carbon, and Park Counties, Wyoming. 
Approximately 54% of the acreage is operated, and 46% is non-operated. 
Essentially all of the acreage is held by production from existing wells and production units with net revenue interest greater than 75%. 
Average net daily production during the fourth quarter of 2014 of approximately 50 BOE per day (approximately 98% oil).
Net proved developed producing ("PDP") oil and natural gas reserves of approximately 174,000 BOE (approximately 100% oil) as of December 31, 2014, based on an independent reserves analysis prepared by Netherland Sewell. Notably, no proved developed non-producing ("PDNP") nor proved undeveloped ("PUD") reserves have been assigned to these properties.
The WIOG assets strategically place TRXO in three basin resource plays in Wyoming. The acquired acreage increases TRXO's total acreage position in Wyoming at March 31, 2015 to approximately 34,455 gross (19,579 net) acres, providing TRXO with an increased operational footprint throughout the northern Rockies.
Pursuant to the final terms of the transaction, TRXO assumed debt obligations of approximately $650,000. The transaction makes WIOG shareholders one of TRXO's largest shareholder groups with approximately 48% ownership when all shares are exchanged. Two directors from the WIOG shareholder base will be appointed to the TRXO Board within the next 30 days.
Don Walford, Chairman and CEO of the TRXO, stated, "We are pleased to have successfully closed this acquisition with WIOG shareholders, and we are excited to expand our prospect areas in prime Wyoming resource plays with some proven production. We look forward to having Eckhardt Huber-Flotho and Werner Georg Biberacher join our board and combining the key employees of WIOG into TRXO, all of whom add expertise and deep industry experience to our own experienced staff. We believe together we can continue to build focused industry players in the Northern Rockies in Wyoming."
Based on March 30, 2015's market price of $2.56, the 9,000,000 shares have a market valuation of approximately 23,000,000
