A Conversation with Dwight Utz

executive vice president and COO, PeoplesBank
Q: What makes PeoplesBank stand out and remain independent in a sea of bank mergers and acquisitions?A: For more than 150 years, PeoplesBank has been dedicated to building strong, long-lasting relationships with our clients. Whether we're helping a young family buy their first home or an entrepreneur bring their small-business dream to life, our associates do whatever they can to make sure the client is satisfied beyond all expectations. The proof of this success is reflected in our client satisfaction and retention rates, which far outpace industry averages.But it doesn't stop there. Our commitment to improving the quality of life in the communities we serve goes beyond just providing banking services to our neighbors. Our team members actively volunteer thousands of hours of their time and talents serving on nonprofit boards, coaching youth activities, volunteering in hospitals and giving back to those around them. It's what a strong community bank does, and that's why we've been so successful and grown to become the largest independent financial institution headquartered in York County today.

About Dwight Utz
Dwight Utz, 61, comes to PeoplesBank from the former East Carolina Bank, which he served as president and CEO. He is no stranger to Pennsylvania banking, having worked for PNC Bank and CCNB Bank, along with MidSouth Bank.
He is a graduate of Central Pennsylvania College and the Stonier School of Banking.
He and his wife, Debbye, have two sons, Andrew and Nathan, and four grandsons. They live in Seven Valleys.
Thirty-two of American Banker's top 200 most profitable banks are in Pennsylvania; four of those — including PeoplesBank — are in the midstate. Why do you think this area is so strong in community banking?Community banks throughout Central Pennsylvania have a rich, storied history of providing the resources necessary to help our local economies grow, and that tradition continues today. Banks like ours help families save for college, retirement and other expenses. They help businesses, both small and large, expand and create jobs within the community. The products may have changed over time, and the technology has certainly changed, but the commitment has remained the same as it was back when our founders first started our company in 1864.Why is the new credit-card chip technology important to both businesses and their clients?In today's world, you hear too many unfortunate stories related to fraudulent activity and identity theft. The new EMV cards being deployed today will improve payment security by making it more difficult for fraudsters to successfully counterfeit cards. Unlike traditional magnetic-strip cards, every time a new EMV card is used for payment, a unique transaction code is created and cannot be reused.For merchants and financial institutions, the switch to EMV will require adding new technology and internal processing systems and compliance with new liability rules. Consumers will need to activate new cards and learn new payment processes. But in the end, it should result in greater protections against fraudulent activity.
