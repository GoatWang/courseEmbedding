                	Our People            	
















The Sotherly Experience

At Sotherly, we are dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel. That’s why we’ve made delivering true Southern Hospitality our central mission. Because to us, Southern Hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity; it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see, feel, taste, and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer, both during their stay and after they leave.
Our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a Southern summer night.


We’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind, weaving our trademark Southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin.
At the end of the day, our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such.  Our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again, and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders.










Sotherly Foundation

The Sotherly Foundation is the community outreach arm of Sotherly Hotels. We created the Foundation in 2015 because we wanted to take a more hands-on approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels, one family at a time.
Each year, the Sotherly Foundation will provide significant aid to one or more American veterans living in the communities around its hotels. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible. All recipients are chosen by the Sotherly Foundation Board of Directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the United States Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment.
The majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels, although the Foundation does accept donations from the general public as well. As a 501(c)3 registered non-profit, all contributions to the Sotherly Foundation are tax-deductible.

The Whitehall



Houston
Built in 1963 in the heart of downtown Houston, The Whitehall quickly established itself as one of the city’s most stylish and well-known hotels and remains so to this day. Superbly located within walking distance of such leading business and leisure destinations as the George R. Brown Convention Center, Rice University, Minute Maid Park, and Houston’s Theatre District, the hotel is directly connected via skywalk to more than 2 million square feet of Class-A office space with major tenants such as KBR, Chevron and United Airlines. The hotel offers 259 guest rooms and 12,000 square feet of meeting space.
Sotherly Hotels acquired the property in November 2013, adding to its portfolio a prized, high-performing asset in the heart of the largest MSA in the southern United States. In 2014, Sotherly began a comprehensive $5.0 million renovation and rebranding of the hotel that included updates to The Whitehall’s guest rooms and public spaces, the creation of two new food and beverage outlets, Part & Parcel and Buffalo Bayou Coffee, as well as an upgraded look and concept for the hotel’s existing restaurant, Edgar’s Hermano.
Take me to Houston

The Georgian Terrace



Atlanta
 
Grand yet welcoming, The Georgian Terrace is the epitome of true Southern hospitality. Built in 1911, this historic icon soon became known as  “The Grande Dame of Atlanta.” Modernized in 1991 with the addition of a new tower, the hotel remains a celebrated architectural masterpiece situated at the heart of Atlanta’s Midtown Mile, directly across from the world-famous Fox Theatre and adjacent business and commercial districts.
Fully renovated in all areas, including $6.0 million in guest room upgrades since 2014, The Georgian Terrace boasts 326 well-appointed rooms, over 16,000 square feet of world-class business facilities, and three classic ballrooms. The hotel’s own Livingston Restaurant + Bar, Edgar’s Proof & Provision, and Buffalo Bayou Coffee offer innovative Southern-inspired cuisine, spirited libation, and local brews while ensuring The Georgian Terrace remains “Atlanta’s Modern Classic” for generations to come.
Take me to Atlanta








Hollywood heritage

The Georgian Terrace holds a special place in Hollywood history. In 1939, it hosted the official “Gone With the Wind” pre-premiere party, and continues to play host to many television and film productions taking place around Atlanta today.






A Storied History

A member of the Historic Hotels of America,  The Georgian Terrace opened in 1911, and many of the original architectural details—including floor-to-ceiling windows and majestic marble columns—are still in place today.






Locally Roasted

The Georgian Terrace is home to Buffalo Bayou Coffee, which proudly serves Batdorf + Bronson’s Dancing Goats Blend, roasted locally in the heart of Atlanta.

                	Our People            	
















The Sotherly Experience

At Sotherly, we are dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel. That’s why we’ve made delivering true Southern Hospitality our central mission. Because to us, Southern Hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity; it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see, feel, taste, and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer, both during their stay and after they leave.
Our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a Southern summer night.


We’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind, weaving our trademark Southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin.
At the end of the day, our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such.  Our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again, and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders.










Sotherly Foundation

The Sotherly Foundation is the community outreach arm of Sotherly Hotels. We created the Foundation in 2015 because we wanted to take a more hands-on approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels, one family at a time.
Each year, the Sotherly Foundation will provide significant aid to one or more American veterans living in the communities around its hotels. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible. All recipients are chosen by the Sotherly Foundation Board of Directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the United States Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment.
The majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels, although the Foundation does accept donations from the general public as well. As a 501(c)3 registered non-profit, all contributions to the Sotherly Foundation are tax-deductible.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes.

It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff are and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.

Worldwide Hotel Finder: Top Hotel Destinations
Popular Hotel Destinations in the Western U.S
When you book with Travelocity, the West Coast is your oyster. Enjoy the razzle and dazzle of fast-paced life in one of the big coastal cities, or pack up your ski equipment for the adventure of a lifetime. We offer a wide variety of accommodations to suit your tastes; rest in the penthouse suite of a five-star resort, or enjoy a home-cooked meal in a charming bed and breakfast. No matter where – or when – you want to get away, Travelocity is here to help you land the best deals swiftly and painlessly. Stop putting off that trip – adventure awaits.
The celebrities, the sports, the shopping… yes, you’ve heard stories of “Tinsel Town.” Isn’t it time for you to see if the tales are true? Check out Southern California’s allure for yourself when you book  hotels in Los Angeles.
Friend, they don’t call it “Sin City” for nothing. Cruise through the casinos, take a gondola ride, then rest up in Las Vegas hotels to do it all again in the morning. Or evening. Whatever suits you. 
Mark Twain once said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. You’ll have to judge the truth of that for yourself – and try the famous clam chowder at Pier 39 while you’re at it – when you book a night in our San Francisco hotels.
Next up, glide down the California coastline to the other city by the bay. No matter when you reserve San Diego hotels, you’ll enjoy year-round sunshine, beautiful beaches, and yes, those famous burritos. 
Move inland toward Colorado and relax in the capital city – our hotels in Denver will take care of all your worries. Book that ski trip, sample craft brews, or just find new ways to get elevated in the “Mile-High City.”

Book Hotel Rooms on the East Coast
The East Coast of the United States has much to offer the discerning traveler hungry for adventure and a delicious meal. From sky-high suites with stunning views to delightful hospitality and fresh-squeezed orange juice at a bed and breakfast, we have accommodation for all tastes. As for the food, well, your new city has plenty in store for you. 
Take a seat at a raw bar on the Boston waterfront and partake of refreshing oysters straight from the sea – the terroir of Cape Cod Bay is spectacular. Encounter living history on the Freedom Trail, or rendezvous with Rembrandt and Monet at the Museum of Fine Arts. Rest assured that Boston hotels will always be ready with a soft pillow where you can lay your head and dream of tomorrow’s plans. 
Journey west to hotels in New York City and discover the treasures of America’s most spectacular metropolis. From the morning sun shining on the Statue of Liberty to the sparkling lights of the skyline at night, there is nothing like the Big Apple. As Sinatra said, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. 
The great William Smith once extolled the virtues of another celebrated East Coast city: Philadelphia. Travelocity’s hotels in Philadelphia are the perfect place to relax after a day spent dining on signature cheesesteak and reveling in America’s most important historical landmarks. 
Philly may be the site of politics past, but Washington, D.C. hotels are where today’s mavens meet and mingle. Travelocity will have you keeping company with the nation’s brass and taking in some of the world’s greatest museums before you can say “Let’s do brunch.” 
If you’re looking for a different kind of charm, perhaps it’s Charlotte hotels you seek. Settle in with a homemade sweet tea and enjoy the Southern hospitality. Later, venture downtown and find a darkened lounge brimming over with sultry blues music. Your East Coast vacation is complete.

Top Hotels in America's Midwest
The Midwest is home to some of America’s most vibrant cities, with world-class attractions and mouthwatering treats for all tastes. When you book with Travelocity, you’ll spend less time searching and more time dreaming of ice skating on a winter’s eve or a warm, cheesy slice of deep-dish pizza. Whatever your desires, the Midwest is a must-see stop for any traveler. 
Let’s begin our journey in the birthplace of that delectable deep-dish pizza we mentioned. Chicago hotels are about much more than tempting tidbits. Promenade along Navy Pier for waterfront tableaus or take yourself upward, to the top of the Willis Tower for sweeping skyline views. 
Hotels in Detroit offer up a whole new world of attractions, from lovely strolls in the gorgeous Belle Isle Park to perusing masterpieces at the Institute of Arts. Of course, you can always simply immerse yourself in the sultry tunes of Motown. 
Yearning for a summer frolic through gardens of modern sculpture? Or a winter’s afternoon spent gliding along a frozen lake followed by a steaming cup of hot chocolate? Hotels in Minneapolis are your home away from home for year-round outdoor adventure – plus so much quintessential Midwestern charm, you’ll never want to leave. 
Slip south to hotels in St. Louis to dine on the city’s renowned smoky barbecue and melt-in-your-mouth gooey butter cake. Then cross state lines to Malcolm Martin Memorial Park in Illinois for a million-dollar view of the Gateway Arch. 
If you like to spend your getaways wandering amongst quaint village enclaves with nary an itinerary in sight, Columbus hotels are your ideal match. Amble through historic architecture and urban gardens in the German Village neighborhood, then let butterflies alight on your shoulders at the Franklin Park Conservatory. In America’s Midwest, no dream goes unfulfilled – and no treasures go undiscovered when you let Travelocity be your guide.

Hotel Deals in Southern United States
Where do you find your travel inspiration? Is it in the enticing flavors of a new and exciting cuisine? Or in the beautiful sights and sounds of historic districts and vintage theatres? Whatever it is that fuels your appetite for adventure, the American South has it. Brimming with vibrant culture, savory dishes and year-round warmth, it’s always the ideal place for your next getaway. 
Many a traveler has felt the pull of the “Sunshine State”— after all, it’s difficult to resist more than a thousand miles of coastline and 250 days of bright skies. If you’re drawn to the allure of Miami hotels, recline in comfort on the famous sands of South Beach, then trade in your sandals and dress up for a festive soiree. Further north, America’s most well-known theme parks are at your doorstep with hotels in Orlando; along with world-class entertainment and dining outside the parks as well. 
For another city where the days are sunny and the nights are merry, explore Travelocity’s hotels in Atlanta. Spend an afternoon enveloped in the smells of hydrangeas and camellia as you wander the paths of the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in search of peaceful meditation spot. By night, stroll through the Fox Theatre Historic District and immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of outstanding ballet, symphony, and theatre productions. 
If you envision a vacation that boasts quintessential Southern charm and plenty of delectable morsels, a trip to Texas just may be in your future. Yearning to tempt your taste buds with juicy brisket that melts in your mouth, slaw, and whiskey cake? You’re in search of Dallas hotels, wise wanderer. However, no Texas tour is complete without a visit to the home of NASA, “Space City,” or the impressive Museum of Fine Arts, one of America’s largest. Travelocity’s hotels in Houston will certainly have you saying “The eagle has landed.”

Best International Hotel Accommodation
You’re a worldly sort, not the type to let those travel guidebooks gather dust, and your globe provides inspiration as much as decoration. But where to go next? From the cosmopolitan cities of Canada to the timeless destinations of Europe, there is no shortage of new places to explore. Delve into Travelocity’s incredible selection of international hotel accommodation and prepare for your next adventure. 
One of the world’s finest international destinations is close to home: Your northern neighbor. Canada has much more on its plate than poutine, the famous French fry and cheese curd combination. Reserve  Montreal hotels to experience its historic Old Port, glimpse the towering Notre-Dame Basilica, and stroll through one of the world’s largest botanical gardens. To the southwest, Toronto hotels stand ready to introduce you to this quirky, charming city. Home to the expansive, Frank Gehry-designed Art Gallery of Ontario and vibrant neighborhoods like Kensington Market and the Distillery District, Toronto is perfect for those savvy travelers who like something a little different. 
If your travel desires lie farther afield, you may need a trip to Europe. London hotels are the ideal destination for wise wanderers who seek extraordinary architecture, a thriving theatre scene— and of course, classic, wood-paneled pubs where you can sip a pint. Or, look into our hotels in Rome and travel even further back in time, to antiquity itself. Gaze up at the massive Colosseum and you’ll soon understand why its name so closely resembles “colossal.” Peruse artworks by the great masters at the Galleria Borghese and then bask in the sunshine in the adjoining park as you daydream. Continue your art tour of Europe with Paris hotels and traverse through the Louvre in pursuit of da Vinci and Michelangelo. Wherever your travels take you, go confidently: Travelocity is always here to help you find a comfortable place to rest your head.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
