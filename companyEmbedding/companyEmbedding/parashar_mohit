STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HARMAN 
      International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:HAR), the premier 
      connected technologies company for automotive, consumer and enterprise 
      markets, today named Mohit Parasher, 47, as Executive Vice President and 
      President, Professional Solutions, effective immediately. Parasher was 
      previously Vice President and General Manager for HARMAN’s Consumer 
      Audio and Professional Solutions businesses in Asia Pacific. He joins 
      the HARMAN Executive Committee and reports to Dinesh C. Paliwal, 
      Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HARMAN.
    


      Parasher succeeds Blake Augsburger, who will remain with HARMAN for a 
      short transition period and plans to retire from the field of 
      professional audio to pursue other business interests.
    

      “Mohit has consistently demonstrated outstanding leadership and success 
      in general management, sales, marketing and channel management, 
      achieving rapid growth for HARMAN’s audio brands and Professional 
      Solutions in Asia Pacific,” said Paliwal. “In addition to his impressive 
      record at HARMAN, Mohit has more than 20 years of global experience 
      growing audio, video and systems businesses throughout Asia, the Middle 
      East, Africa and Europe. A proven transformation architect in the retail 
      and business-to-business segments, Mohit has the ideal background to 
      evolve our Professional Solutions division to a holistic solutions-based 
      organization and capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities 
      before us.”
    

      Parasher is responsible for all worldwide operations, strategy and 
      performance of the Professional Solutions division, the world’s largest 
      professional audio, lighting, video and control products and systems 
      organization. The division serves the entertainment and enterprise 
      markets with comprehensive systems, including enterprise automation and 
      complete IT solutions for a broad range of applications. He will be 
      based at the headquarters for Professional Solutions in Northridge, 
      Calif.
    

      “Blake has been extremely influential in the evolution of HARMAN’s 
      Professional portfolio, most recently leading the extension of our 
      capabilities beyond audio and into lighting and enterprise solutions,” 
      continued Paliwal. “We are grateful for his many contributions to the 
      success of the company and wish him well in his future endeavors.”
    

      Parasher joined HARMAN in May 2014 as Vice President and General 
      Manager, Consumer Audio for Asia Pacific. Prior to HARMAN, he was CEO of 
      Retail at Bharti Airtel, where he conceptualized and successfully 
      executed the company’s “serve to sell” business philosophy across its 
      1,200 retail stores. He also served as CEO and Executive Director for 
      Beetel Teletech, a Bharti enterprise, where he turned the company 
      profitable in his first three quarters on the job. Parasher enjoyed a 
      long career with Sony where he managed market development across the 
      world, including in the UK, Poland, India, Lebanon, Morocco and United 
      Arab Emirates. In addition, Parasher served on the Supervisory Board of 
      Sony Germany and the Board of Sony Europe. He earned a Master of 
      Business Administration from the University of Pune and a Bachelor of 
      Science from the University of Allahabad. He also received an executive 
      management education from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.
