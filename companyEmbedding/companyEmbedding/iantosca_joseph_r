GlobeNewswire



May 13, 2013 12:00 PM EDT













 




























































    TOMS RIVER, N.J., May 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. (Nasdaq:OCFC), the holding company for OceanFirst Bank, announced two Executive Vice President appointments made by the Bank's Board of Directors: Joseph R. Iantosca, Chief Administrative Officer; and Joseph J. Lebel III, Chief Lending Officer.  John R. Garbarino, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "Our Board is pleased to recognize the many contributions of Joseph Iantosca and Joseph Lebel, two valued members of our leadership team, in taking this additional important step in our succession planning. Individually, Joe Iantosca and Joe Lebel have demonstrated a commitment to the success of our Company along with a dedication to our future growth and mission of building long-term shareholder value."  Mr. Iantosca, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, will continue to be responsible for the delivery of essential services such as: retail customer services, loan servicing, marketing, information technology, facilities management and expansion. These areas provide the extraordinary infrastructure which supports the Company's growth strategies. Mr. Iantosca joined OceanFirst Bank in February 2004 as Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer and was appointed First Senior Vice President in May 2007.     Mr. Lebel, Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, will continue to be responsible for the credit culture of the Company, leading the expansion of commercial, small business, residential and consumer borrowing relationships. Mr. Lebel has demonstrated extraordinary leadership since joining the Bank in April 2006 as Senior Vice President of Commercial Lending. He was appointed First Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer in May 2007. Mr. Lebel has been a respected lender in the central New Jersey market for over 28 years and during his tenure at OceanFirst has expanded the Bank's lending capabilities to meet the challenges of the highly competitive lending environment.  OceanFirst Financial Corp.'s subsidiary, OceanFirst Bank, founded in 1902, is a federally-chartered savings bank with $2.3 billion in assets and twenty-five branches located in Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex Counties, New Jersey. The Bank is the largest and oldest community-based financial institution headquartered in Ocean County, New Jersey.

Ex-Div Reminder For OceanFirst Financial (OCFC)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 1/29/15, OceanFirst Financial Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.13, payable on 2/13/15. As a percentage of OCFC's recent stock price of $16.11, this dividend works out to approximately 0.81%, so look for shares of OceanFirst Financial Corp to trade 0.81% lower — all else being equal — when OCFC shares open for trading on 1/29/15.
