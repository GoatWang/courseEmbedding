Extruded Aluminum Framing & Shapes

What are Aluminum Extrusions?
If you’ve ever pushed Play Doh through a press to create shapes, then you’ve got the basic principle behind aluminum extrusion. Through this process, aluminum extrusion manufacturers can create cross-sectional objects, or “profiles.” To produce these profiles, raw aluminum is pushed through a tool called a “die” at temperatures of up to 900° F. The result is a perfectly shaped piece of aluminum. Extruded framing and shapes are used in several different industries because of their unique benefits.
Benefits of Aluminum
If you want strong framing that won’t rust, spark, melt or be too heavy, look no further than aluminum extrusion. Companies in a variety of industries have learned the benefits of extruded aluminum for framing and other projects. To add to the natural benefits of aluminum, our extrusion expertise means you can order shapes in a variety of colors, all without strange seams and supports. Then, you can choose any kind of finish, and we’ll ship you everything you need. Click below to discover additional benefits of extruded aluminum and find out how this exceptional metal can help your company thrive.

Uses of Extruded Aluminum
Aluminum is among the most useful materials in the world, and aluminum extrusion companies have made inroads in nearly every industry. Applications have included:
Electronics: Many electronics employ sensitive magnets. For this reason, extruded aluminum can be found in many electronic gadgets and tools.
Transportation: Auto manufacturers prefer aluminum over other metals because it is lightweight. This limits emissions and improves vehicle performance.
This is just the beginning. Contact us to find out how our extruded products can be beneficial to your company.
Solar Energy
Solar energy is a rapidly growing industry and extruded aluminum is intimately linked to the manufacturing and proliferation of solar panels. Commonly used as solar panel mounting systems, aluminum extrusions are highly customizable and can withstand any type of weather.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
