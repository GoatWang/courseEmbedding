      Our Commitment    

At Caregiver Homes, we firmly believe that the caregivers of our nation should never be alone in providing care for their loved ones. This belief originated with the founding of Seniorlink in 2000 by E. Byron Hensley, Jr. Impassioned by his own family caregiving experience, Mr. Hensley wanted to expand the choices available to other families in need of care and support. In 2005, Seniorlink launched Caregiver Homes, an innovative Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) program, which received the National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) highest level of Case Management Accreditation. Today we stand alongside thousands of caregivers and their loved ones as they continue on their compassionate journey.




      Our Model: Care with Confidence    

Over the years, we’ve worked closely with caregivers to assure they feel confident and secure in providing care for a loved one at home. If you’re considering making a commitment to care for a family member or loved one, we look forward to doing the same for you.
Our Structured Family Caregiving model is a high-quality alternative to full-time models of care that rely on facilities or in-home workers such as personal care attendants (PCAs). Structured Family Caregiving offers guidance, financial assistance and overall support at every step along the way, helping you feel more confident in providing care for a loved one. Although caregivers are often family members, anyone committed to living with a care recipient, offering support as needed around the clock and providing care like family, may be eligible. 
As a caregiver, having a strong, loving relationship with a person you care for offers irreplaceable emotional benefits, and proven health benefits as well. In fact, we hear from caregivers in our program all the time about how being a live-in caregiver and supporting a loved one at home has benefited the entire family. Hear from them directly by visiting our stories page.

ABOUT Seniorlink: Our Story and Our Team







Seniorlink is an innovator of care collaboration solutions that balance human touch and technology to deliver better outcomes, resulting in lower costs for providers and health systems. Built on more than a decade of care management expertise, our solutions deliver high-quality, person-centered care by pairing interdisciplinary care teams – including family caregivers – with our novel care collaboration platform, Vela. 
Our Story
Seniorlink was founded by E. Byron Hensley, Jr. in 2000. Impassioned by his own family’s caregiving experience, Byron sought to expand the resources available to family caregivers around the country.
In 2005 the company launched Caregiver Homes, a unique in-home care management solution that pairs experienced care teams with live-in caregivers and their families, offering coaching and support at every step. After launching in Massachusetts, Caregiver Homes expanded steadily and today serves thousands of families across six states. It was the first home and community-based service in the nation to receive the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) highest level of Accreditation for Case Management, and is the only NCQA-approved provider for case management in all states where it operates today.
In 2016, Seniorlink launched a HIPAA-secure care collaboration platform, Vela, to address the full spectrum of care management needs. Vela is designed to allow all members of a patient's care team – including case managers, providers, and caregivers both inside and outside the home – to communicate seamlessly. In combining this technology with a proven model for case management, Seniorlink offers solutions to plan, deliver, and coordinate care efficiently for any patient population. 
Our commitment to caregivers remains strong as we continually seek new ways to honor and support the mission of more than 60 million caregivers nationwide.
Our Purpose
We are committed to continually pioneering solutions that bring together knowledge, human touch and innovation to transform the caregiving experience. At Seniorlink, we stand with the Caregiver Nation, honoring caregivers and their families and ensuring they will never be alone on their daily journey of providing compassionate care.

Management Team







 
Meet E. Byron Hensley Jr.
Chairman“I stand with the Caregiver Nation by revering the dignity and importance of caregiving as I recognize its life changing force.”
Byron founded Seniorlink to provide elders and those living with disabilities with the choice to receive care at home. The business idea was born out of the The MENTOR Network model, which Byron founded to support families caring for troubled teens and developmentally disabled adults. MENTOR now operates in 35 states generating $1.5 billion in annual revenue. Byron recognized the need for better care options when he witnessed his grandfather's loss of independence upon moving to a nursing home. His resulting belief—that every person has the right to age with dignity, including the option to live out his or her life at home—was the impetus for Seniorlink's founding in 2000.

ABOUT Seniorlink: Our Story and Our Team







Seniorlink is an innovator of care collaboration solutions that balance human touch and technology to deliver better outcomes, resulting in lower costs for providers and health systems. Built on more than a decade of care management expertise, our solutions deliver high-quality, person-centered care by pairing interdisciplinary care teams – including family caregivers – with our novel care collaboration platform, Vela. 
Our Story
Seniorlink was founded by E. Byron Hensley, Jr. in 2000. Impassioned by his own family’s caregiving experience, Byron sought to expand the resources available to family caregivers around the country.
In 2005 the company launched Caregiver Homes, a unique in-home care management solution that pairs experienced care teams with live-in caregivers and their families, offering coaching and support at every step. After launching in Massachusetts, Caregiver Homes expanded steadily and today serves thousands of families across six states. It was the first home and community-based service in the nation to receive the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) highest level of Accreditation for Case Management, and is the only NCQA-approved provider for case management in all states where it operates today.
In 2016, Seniorlink launched a HIPAA-secure care collaboration platform, Vela, to address the full spectrum of care management needs. Vela is designed to allow all members of a patient's care team – including case managers, providers, and caregivers both inside and outside the home – to communicate seamlessly. In combining this technology with a proven model for case management, Seniorlink offers solutions to plan, deliver, and coordinate care efficiently for any patient population. 
Our commitment to caregivers remains strong as we continually seek new ways to honor and support the mission of more than 60 million caregivers nationwide.
Our Purpose
We are committed to continually pioneering solutions that bring together knowledge, human touch and innovation to transform the caregiving experience. At Seniorlink, we stand with the Caregiver Nation, honoring caregivers and their families and ensuring they will never be alone on their daily journey of providing compassionate care.

          - Data show the introduction of Falls Risk Assessment and Management Program resulted in a 50 percent reduction of falls rate for care recipients- Caregiver Homes' intensive in-home care management model leverages insights from caregivers and dedicated care teams to develop person-centered care plans.

BOSTON, March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Seniorlink, Inc., a company focused on delivering scalable care management solutions that balance human touch and technology, today announced positive data from its Falls Risk Assessment and Management Program. The program leveraged technology to activate family caregivers and improve outcomes for care recipients. Results were presented at Aging in America 2017: The Annual Conference of the American Society on Aging, held from March 20-24 in Chicago, IL. 








The analysis assessed the impact of Seniorlink's proprietary Falls Risk Assessment and Management Program (FMP), including a Falls Quick Screen (FQS), which was implemented within Seniorlink's intensive in-home care management model, Caregiver Homes (CGH). Experienced care teams trained in the FMP model evaluated care recipients for both the risk of fall and the risk of injury; care plans were then individually adjusted based on FQS scores. These care team members also educated in-home caregivers on falls risk prevention.
As a result of the support provided to caregivers through the FMP training, there was a 50 percent reduction in the rate of falls for care recipients (from a peak of 1.46 falls per 1,000 consumer days to 0.73). This rate is lower than published fall rates in skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, which range from 1.3 to 8.9 falls per 1,000 days. Additionally, those over the age of 65 did not fall at a higher rate than those under the age of 65.
"This data is significant because it demonstrates the notable decrease in the rate of falls for patients receiving in-home care who participated in our Falls Risk Assessment and Management Program, compared with the rate of falls for patients receiving care in hospitals and nursing facilities," said Jay V. Patel, Clinical Transformation Officer, Seniorlink Inc. "We are confident the continued application of this program will allow caregivers and care teams to maintain and even improve upon the encouraging results further."
The data will be presented in a poster titled "Leveraging Technology to Engage Family Caregivers to Improve Outcomes" (Board 312), on Wednesday, March 22 from 12pm – 1:30pm CDT in the Riverside East Tower at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.
About the AnalysisA total of 2,460 total care recipients were evaluated in this analysis, with 1,285 participants over the age of 65 and 1,175 under the age of 65. A comprehensive Falls Risk Assessment and Management Program was implemented by CGH that aimed to train care managers, who in turn educated caregivers on falls risk assessment, prevention, and management. Training sessions for care teams occurred initially in 2011 and again in 2013. All care recipients were evaluated for fall risk using a proprietary screener called the Falls Quick Screen (FQS). The FQS assessed fall history, gait, balance, medication regimen, age, and other factors that impact falls. The FQS assessed both risk of falling and risk of injurious fall and then assigned each care recipient to a risk quadrant that predicts risk for fall and risk for injury if a fall should occur.
Once the risk of falling and risk of injurious falls was assigned, the care plan was reassessed and revised to determine when follow-up was needed. These revisions included additional coaching for caregiver and/or care recipient, referral to external skilled services (such as physical therapy), collaboration with pharmacists to review and revise their medication plan, and other actions that were recipient-centered, dynamic, and sensitive to changes in health status. Any fall that did occur was considered an event, no matter the injury status. Falls were verified by nurses or care managers, via either telephone or home visit. The rate of falls was calculated as the number of falls per 1,000 care recipient days. 
As CGH operated in only two states when data was collected in 2011 (MA and RI) and has since expanded in both number of states and care recipients served, the demographic change made comparisons of earlier and later fall rates difficult to compare. Thus, the fall rate for a MA-only population was determined.
