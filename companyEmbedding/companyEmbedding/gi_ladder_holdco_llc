	On March 3, 2017, Ladder Capital Corp (Ladder or the Company), Related Real Estate Fund II, L.P. (Related), which is an affiliate of The Related Companies, L.P., and certain pre-IPO stockholders of Ladder, including affiliates of TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P. and GI Partners L.P., closed the previously announced purchase by Related of $80.0 million of Ladders Class A common stock (the Shares) from the pre-IPO stockholders. The investment was made by a wholly owned subsidiary of Related, which is an opportunity fund with equity commitments of over $1 billion.




	 




	As part of the closing of the transaction, Ladder and Related entered into a Stockholders Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2017, pursuant to which Jonathan Bilzin, Managing Director of TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P., resigned from the Board of Directors, and all committees thereof, and Ladder appointed Richard OToole, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of The Related Companies L.P., to replace Mr. Bilzin as a Class II Director on Ladders Board of Directors, each effective as of March 3, 2017. The Company thanks Mr. Bilzin for his years of dedicated service to the Company.




	 




	In connection with the foregoing, Mr. OToole was appointed to the Boards Audit Committee and Douglas Durst was appointed chair of the Boards Compensation Committee.




	 




	Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Ladder granted to Related a right of first offer with respect to certain horizontal risk retention investments in which Ladder intends to retain an interest and Related agreed to certain standstill provisions.




	 




	In addition, as part of the closing of the transaction, Ladder, certain pre-IPO stockholders and Related entered into a Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement providing, among other things, Related with customary registration rights with respect to the Shares.




	 




	In connection with Mr. OToole joining the Board of Directors, on March 3, 2017, he was granted restricted shares of the Companys Class A common stock, pursuant to Ladders 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, with a grant date fair value of $75,000, which represented 5,130 shares. The restricted shares vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date or upon a change in control of the Company, subject to Mr. OTooles continued service on the Board of Directors.

	5













	 




	Director in person and (3) consented to the Alternate Director serving as the replacement to Mr. OToole (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  The Alternate Director shall not be eligible for selection as a replacement New Class II Director if he has been involved in any of the events enumerated in Item 2(d) or 2(e) of Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act or Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or is subject to any order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Entity prohibiting service as a director of any public company.

	) to the Stockholder stating the Companys bona fide intention to make a Securitization Investment, and setting forth in reasonable detail the material terms of such Securitization Investment (which terms shall be those set forth in the Partnership Term Sheet attached hereto as Exhibit B) and the price and terms (not inconsistent with Exhibit B), if any, upon which it proposes to offer the Stockholder a non-controlling interest in such Securitization Investment.  The terms and conditions of the ROFO Offer shall be arms-length terms.



	 




	(c)

	) to accept the terms and conditions of such ROFO Offer.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	If the Stockholder fails to accept a ROFO Offer during the ROFO Offer Period in accordance with Section 3(c), the Company shall be permitted to Transfer such Securitization Investment on substantially similar terms and conditions proposed to the Stockholder to a third

	), without the prior written approval of the Company, each Stockholder Party shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:  (i) acquire or offer to acquire, seek, propose or agree to acquire, by means of a purchase, tender or exchange offer, business combination or in any other manner, Beneficial Ownership of any Voting Securities, including rights or options to acquire such ownership; or (ii) other than pursuant to this Agreement, seek or propose to influence, advise, change or control the management, Board, governing instruments or policies or affairs of the Company, including by means of a solicitation of proxies (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act, disregarding Rule 14a-1(l)(2)(iv) thereunder), including any otherwise exempt solicitation pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b) under the Exchange Act) or seeking to influence, advise or direct the vote of any holder of Voting Securities;

	provided

	,

	however,

	that the Standstill Period shall terminate automatically upon (A) any person (x) becoming the Beneficial Owner of Voting Securities representing 50% or more of the Total Voting Power or (y) publicly announcing or commencing a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would make such Person (or any of its Affiliates) the Beneficial Owner of Voting Securities representing 50% or more of the Total Voting Power or (B) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with a third party to effectuate (x) a sale of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries or (y) a transaction (1) that, in whole or in part, requires the approval of the Companys stockholders and, (2) in which, based on information publicly available at the time of announcement of the entering into of such agreement, the holders of Voting Securities prior to such transaction will not own, immediately following such transaction, Voting Securities representing at least 80% of the Total Voting Power of either (I) the corporation resulting from such transaction (the 

	Surviving Corporation

	), or (II), if applicable, the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of all of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation.  Nothing in this Section 4(a) shall (i) limit the New Class II Director from taking any actions in his or her capacity as a director of the Company or (ii) prohibit the acquisition by the Stockholder Parties of Beneficial Ownership of Voting Securities or any derivative or synthetic interests or any hedging, swap, forward or other derivative contracts in relation thereto;

	provided

	, that after giving effect thereto, the Stockholder Parties Beneficial Ownership of Voting Securities does not exceed 9.8% of the Total Voting Power.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Neither the Stockholder nor any of the other Stockholder Parties shall Transfer any Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by them to any



	 



	7













	 




	Permitted Transferee unless such Permitted Transferee becomes a party to and fully subject to and bound by this Agreement to the same extent as the transferring party by executing and delivering a joinder to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit A

	.




	 




	(c)


	                                 

	Without limiting the foregoing, the Stockholder Parties agree that they will not Transfer any Voting Securities except in compliance with any applicable state, federal or foreign securities Laws.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	The right of any Stockholder Party or any of their respective Affiliates to Transfer Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by such Person is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 4, and no Transfer by any Stockholder Party or any of its Affiliates of Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by such Person may be effected except in compliance with this Section 4.  Any attempted Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be of no effect and null and void, regardless of whether the purported transferee has any actual or constructive knowledge of the Transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement, and the Company shall not, and shall instruct its transfer agent and other third parties not to, record or recognize any such purported transaction on the share register of the Company.  No Transfer by a Stockholder Party shall be effective unless and until the Company shall have been furnished with information reasonably satisfactory to it demonstrating that such Transfer is (x) in compliance with this Section 4 and (y) registered under, exempt from or not subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities Laws.



	 




	(e)


	                                 

	Any additional Voting Securities of which any Stockholder Party acquires Beneficial Ownership following the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date shall be subject to the restrictions and commitments set forth in this Section 4 as fully as if such Voting Securities were Beneficially Owned by such Person as of the date hereof.

	(b)  

	Priority on Primary Registrations

	(c)  

	Priority on Secondary Registrations

	.  If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Class A Shares (which includes a Synthetic Offering, with any such Synthetic Offering being deemed an underwritten offering of Registrable Shares solely for purposes of this Agreement) (it being understood that Demand Registrations on behalf of holders of Registrable Shares are addressed in

	Section 3

	rather than in this

	Section 4(c)

	), and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of Class A Shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders initially requesting such registration and without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, then the Company shall include in such Piggyback Registration (i) first, the number of Registrable Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration, pro rata among the holders of such Registrable Shares according to the number of Registrable Shares held by each such holder relative to the total number of Registrable Shares held by all such holders of Registrable Shares requesting to include Registrable Shares in such Piggyback Registration as of the date the Company provided written notice of such Piggyback Registration to the holders of Registrable Shares (while subject to each such holder of Registrable Shares including in such Piggyback Registration no more than the number of Registrable Shares requested by such holder to be included in such Piggyback Registration) and, if all Registrable Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration have been included, (ii) second, any other Class A Shares requested to be included in such registration, in such manner as the Company may determine.

	Section 2

	,

	Section 3

	or pursuant to this

	Section 4

	, and if such previous registration has not been withdrawn or abandoned, then all the parties hereto agree that the Company shall not be required to effect any other registration of any of its equity or similar securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for its equity or similar securities under the Securities Act (except in connection with a Demand Registration), whether on its own behalf or at the request of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least 180 days has elapsed from the effective date of such previous registration.

	5.    

	Holdback Agreements

	(a)   No holder of Registrable Shares shall sell, transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any such equity securities, during the seven days prior to (except in the case of an Underwritten Shelf Offering, in which case, during the three business days prior to) and the up to 90-day period (with the ultimate duration of such period to be as determined by the underwriters managing the applicable underwritten offering of Registrable Shares) beginning on the effective date of the final prospectus for any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares with an aggregate offering value of Registrable Shares of at least $10,000,000 (the 

	Holdback Period

	), except as part of such underwritten offering, unless the underwriters managing the underwritten offering agree in writing (in which case all holders of Registrable Shares shall be released from the Holdback Period on a pro rata basis based upon the number of Registrable Shares held by such holder), and each holder of Registrable Shares agrees to promptly execute and deliver any reasonable agreement (including a lock-up agreement) which is consistent with the provisions of this

	Section 5

	and which may be requested and/or required by the underwriters managing such underwritten offering of Registrable Shares.  The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the equity securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of any applicable Holdback Period.




	 




	(b)   At any time following the IPO Date (other than during a Holdback Period), any holder of Registrable Shares that, together with its Affiliates, holds Registrable Shares representing less than 5% of the then outstanding Class A Shares may elect (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively, the 

	Withdrawing Holders

	)), by written notice to the Company, to withdraw from this Agreement and as a result of such withdrawal, such Withdrawing Holders shall no longer be entitled to the rights, nor subject to the obligations of this Agreement, and the Registrable Shares held by the Withdrawing Holders shall irrevocably and conclusively cease to be Registrable Shares under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no withdrawal pursuant to this

	(a)  

	By the Company

	.  The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to agree to, indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Shares, its officers, directors, members, employees, agents, stockholders and general and limited partners and each Person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof), joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, reports required and other documents filed under the Exchange Act, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, together with any documents incorporated therein by reference, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or regulation and relating to action or inaction in connection with any such registration, disclosure document or other document and shall reimburse such holder, officer, director, member, employee, agent, stockholder, partner or controlling Person for any legal or other expenses, including, without limitation, any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, incurred by such holder, officer, director, member, employee, agent, stockholder, partner or controlling Person in connection with the investigation or defense of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such holder expressly for use therein.  In connection with an underwritten offering, the Company shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers, directors, agents and employees  and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of Registrable Shares.




	 




	(b)  

	By the Holders

	.  In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of Registrable Shares is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information about such holder as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and the other holders of Registrable Shares against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such holder which authorizes its use in the applicable document;

	provided

	that the obligation to indemnify will be individual, not joint and several, for each holder and will be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration statement.




	 




	(c)  

	Claim Procedures

	.  Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it




	 



	21













	 




	seeks indemnification (

	provided

	that the failure to give prompt notice will not impair any Persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the indemnifying party shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof, a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation provided by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party.  An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay (i) the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim or (ii) any settlement made by any indemnified party without such indemnifying partys consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).




	 




	(d)  

	Survival; Contribution

	.  The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, agent or employee and each other Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person, if any, who controls such indemnified party (within the meaning of the Securities Act), and will survive the transfer of securities.  The Company also agrees to make such provisions, as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party, for contribution to such party in the event the Companys indemnification is unavailable for any reason.




	 




	9.    

	Participation in Underwritten Registrations

	.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no holder of Registrable Shares may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten or otherwise a distribution of shares hereunder unless such holder (a) agrees to sell such holders applicable Registrable Shares on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (including, without limitation, (i) pursuant to the terms of any over allotment or green shoe option requested by the managing underwriter(s) and (ii) agreeing to pay its pro rata share for the fees and expenses of any third party advisor or consultant retained by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, including for any financial consulting services;

	provided

	that no holder of Registrable Shares shall be required to sell more than the number of Registrable Shares that such holder has requested the Company to include in any registration) and (b) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements (including, without limitation, any applicable lock-up agreement);

	provided

	Ladder Capital Corp





	80,959,036 Shares of Class A Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders



















	        The selling stockholders of Ladder Capital Corp ("Ladder" or the "Company") identified in this prospectus and such additional selling stockholders
	as may be named in one or more prospectus supplements (collectively, the "Selling Stockholders") may offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in amounts, at prices
	and on terms that will be determined at the time of the offering. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock offered by the Selling Stockholders.




	        The Selling Stockholders may sell shares of our Class A common stock, to or through one or more underwriters, dealers and agents, or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or
	delayed basis. This prospectus describes some of the general terms that may apply to these shares of Class A common stock. The specific terms of any securities to be offered will be described
	in one or more supplements to this prospectus. You should read this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement carefully before you invest. Our registration of the securities covered by this
	prospectus does not mean that the Selling Stockholders will offer or sell any shares of our Class A common stock.




	        Our Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "LADR." The last sale price of our Class A common stock on March 3, 2016,
	as reported by NYSE, was $10.90 per share.




	        We
	have two authorized classes of common stock: Class A and Class B. Holders of our Class A common stock and holders of our Class B common stock are each
	entitled to one vote per share of the applicable class of common stock. All such holders vote together as a single class. However, holders of our Class B common stock do not have any right to
	receive dividends or distributions upon our liquidation or winding up. Each share of Class B common stock is, from time to time, exchangeable, when paired together with one LP Unit (as
	defined herein), for one share of Class A common stock, subject to equitable adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.




	        We
	are an "emerging growth company," as that term is defined under the federal securities laws and, as such, are subject to certain reduced public company reporting requirements.




	        



	See "Risk Factors" on page 2 to read about factors you should consider before investing in our securities.





	        This prospectus may not be used to offer and sell any securities unless accompanied by a prospectus supplement.
















	        



	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") nor any state securities commission nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these
	securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.





















	   






	The date of this prospectus is March 4, 2016.

	Neither we nor the Selling Stockholders have authorized any dealer, salesperson or other person to give any information or to make any representation other than
	those contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and the accompanying supplement to this prospectus or any associated "free writing prospectus." In this prospectus, any reference to an
	applicable prospectus supplement may refer to a "free writing prospectus," unless the context otherwise requires. You must not rely upon any information or representation not contained or incorporated
	by reference in this prospectus or the accompanying prospectus supplement. This prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer
	to buy any securities other than the registered securities to which they relate, nor do this prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
	offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. You should not assume that the information contained in this
	prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement is accurate on any date subsequent to the date set forth on the front of the document.









	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS






	        This prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the SEC using a "shelf" registration process.
	Under this shelf process, the Selling Stockholders may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of our Class A common stock in one or more offerings.




	        This prospectus provides you with a general description of the shares of our Class A common stock that the Selling Stockholders may offer. Each time the Selling Stockholders sell
	shares of our Class A
	common stock, we will, to the extent required by law, provide a prospectus supplement that contains specific information about the terms of that offering. This prospectus may not be used to consummate
	sales of our Class A common stock unless it is accompanied by a prospectus supplement. The prospectus supplement may add information to this prospectus or update or change information in this
	prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You should
	carefully read this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with the additional information described under the headings "Where You Can Find More Information" and "Incorporation of Certain
	Information by Reference."




	        You
	should assume that the information in this prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this prospectus.




	        Unless
	the context indicates otherwise, references in this prospectus to "Ladder," "Ladder Capital," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer (1) prior to the February 2014
	initial public




	i











	Table of Contents





	offering
	("IPO") of the Class A common stock of Ladder Capital Corp and related transactions, to Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP ("LCFH"), a Delaware limited liability limited partnership,

	The following summary highlights information contained elsewhere or incorporated by reference into this
	prospectus. It may not contain all the information that may be important to you. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the section titled "Risk Factors" and our historical
	consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference from our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.




	        


	Certain figures included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments. Therefore, figures shown as totals in certain

	Our Company





	        We are a leading commercial real estate finance company structured as an internally-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). We
	conduct our business through three commercial real estate-related business lines: loans, securities and equity investments. We believe that our in-house origination platform, ability to
	flexibly allocate capital among complementary product lines, credit-centric underwriting approach, access to diversified financing sources and experienced management team position us well to deliver
	attractive returns on equity to our shareholders through economic and credit cycles.






	Corporate Information





	        Ladder Capital Corp was incorporated on May 21, 2013 in Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 345 Park
	Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10154, and our telephone number is (212) 715-3170. We maintain a website at www.laddercapital.com.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK






	        



	The following is a description of the material terms of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
	Incorporation, as amended (our "Certificate of Incorporation"), and Amended and Restated Bylaws (our "Bylaws").







	Authorized Capitalization





	        Our authorized capital stock consists of 600,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100,000,000
	shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.




	        As of February 29, 2016, 63,466,181 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, were issued and outstanding, 46,445,729 shares of Class B common
	stock, par value $0.001 per share, were issued and outstanding, and no shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, were issued and outstanding.




	        Unless
	our Board of Directors determines otherwise, we issue all shares of our capital stock in uncertificated form.






	Class A Common Stock








	Voting Rights






	        Holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the
	shareholders. The holders of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.







	Dividend Rights






	        Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be outstanding and any contractual or statutory restrictions,
	holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive equally and ratably, share for share, dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available to pay
	dividends. Dividends upon our Class A common stock may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of capital
	stock. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any of our funds available for dividends, such sums as the Board of Directors deems proper as reserves to meet contingencies, or
	for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any of our property, or for any proper purpose, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve.







	Liquidation Rights






	        Upon liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or other winding up, the holders of Class A common stock are entitled to
	receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any of our outstanding shares of preferred stock.







	Other Matters






	        The shares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or assessment by
	us. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock. All outstanding shares of our Class A common stock are fully paid and non-assessable.

	Table of Contents







	Class B Common Stock








	Voting Rights






	        Holders of shares of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record by such holder on all matters
	submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders
	for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law.







	No Dividend or Liquidation Rights






	        Holders of our Class B common stock do not have any right to receive dividends or to receive a distribution upon a liquidation
	or winding up of Ladder Capital Corp.







	Exchange for Class A Common Stock






	        Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Limited Partnership Agreement effective as of December 31, 2014
	(the "LLLP Agreement") of LCFH, all assets and liabilities of LCFH were allocated on its books and records to two series of LCFH, consisting of "Series REIT" and "Series TRS." Each outstanding limited
	partnership interest in LCFH was converted into one limited partnership unit of Series REIT ("Series REIT LP Unit") and one limited partnership unit of Series TRS ("Series TRS LP Unit"),
	and the outstanding Series TRS LP Units are exchangeable for the same number of limited liability company interests of LC TRS I LLC ("LC TRS I Share"), which is a limited liability
	company that is a U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company and the general partner of Series TRS. Each Series REIT LP Unit, when paired together with one LC
	TRS I Share (or Series TRS LP Unit in lieu of such LC TRS I Share), is referred to herein as an "LP Unit." Holders may from time to time, subject to certain conditions, exchange
	one LP Unit and one share of the Company's Class B common stock for one share of the Company's Class A common stock, subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock
	dividends and reclassifications.






	Preferred Stock





	        Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine,
	with respect to any series of preferred stock, the terms and rights of that series, including:






	




	the designation of the series;








	




	the number of shares of the series which our Board of Directors may, except where otherwise provided in the preferred stock
	designation, increase or decrease, but not below the number of shares then outstanding;








	




	whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or non-cumulative and the dividend rate of the series;








	




	the dates at which dividends, if any, will be payable;








	




	the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the series;








	




	the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the series;








	




	the amounts payable on shares of the series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
	affairs of our Company, or upon any distribution of assets of our Company;






	13











	Table of Contents







	




	whether the shares of the series will be convertible into shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of our Company
	or any other corporation, and, if so, the specification of the other class or series or other security, the conversion price or prices or rate or rates, any rate adjustments, the date or dates as of
	which the shares will be convertible and all other terms and conditions upon which the conversion may be made;








	




	the preferences and special rights, if any, of the series and the qualifications and restrictions, if any, of the series;








	




	the voting rights, if any, of the holders of the series; and








	




	such other rights, powers and preferences with respect to the series as our Board of Directors may deem advisable.








	Authorized but Unissued Capital Stock





	        Delaware law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. However, the listing requirements of the
	NYSE, which apply for so long as our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE, require stockholder approval of certain issuances (other than a public offering) equal to or exceeding 20% of
	the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of Class A common stock, as well as for certain issuances of stock in compensatory transactions. These additional shares
	may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings, to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions. One of the effects of the existence of unissued and
	unreserved Class A common stock may be to enable our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an
	attempt to obtain control of our Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our management and possibly deprive the stockholders of
	opportunities to sell their shares of Class A common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices.






	Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Delaware Law and our Certificate of
	Incorporation and Bylaws





	        Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are summarized in the following paragraphs, may have an
	anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium
	over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.







	Undesignated Preferred Stock






	        The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with super
	voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change in control of us.
	These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of our Company.







	No Cumulative Voting






	        The Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, provides that stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the
	election of directors unless our Certificate of Incorporation provides otherwise. Our Certificate of Incorporation prohibits cumulative voting.




	14











	Table of Contents








	Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders






	        Our Bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called at any time only by the chief executive officer or the Board
	of Directors.







	Stockholder Action by Written Consent






	        The DGCL permits stockholder action by written consent unless otherwise provided by our Certificate of Incorporation. Our Certificate
	of Incorporation precludes stockholder action by written consent.







	Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations






	        Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as
	directors. In order for any matter to be "properly brought" before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Our Bylaws
	allow the presiding officer at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings, which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a
	meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed.




	        These
	provisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to
	obtain control of our Company.







	Removal of Directors; Vacancies






	        Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of
	at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. In addition, our Bylaws provide that any newly-created
	directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors shall be filled only by a majority of the directors
	then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.







	Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute






	        We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Subject to specified exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held
	Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested
	stockholder. "Business combinations" include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the "interested stockholder." Subject to various exceptions, an "interested
	stockholder" is a person who together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the
	corporation's outstanding voting stock. These restrictions generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts.







	Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors






	        The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for
	monetary damages for breaches of directors' fiduciary duties. Our Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for breach
	of fiduciary duty as a director, except:






	




	for breach of duty of loyalty;






	15











	Table of Contents







	




	for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;








	




	under Section 174 of the DGCL (unlawful dividends); or








	




	for transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit.






	        Our
	Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. We are also expressly authorized to,
	and do, carry directors' and officers' insurance providing coverage for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification provisions and
	insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers.




	        The
	limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach
	of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might
	otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant
	to these indemnification provisions.




	        We
	have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers providing for additional indemnification protection beyond that provided by the directors' and
	officers' liability insurance policy. In the indemnification agreements, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify and hold harmless the director or officer to the maximum extent
	then authorized or permitted by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL, or by any amendment(s) thereto.




	        There
	is currently no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.







	REIT-related Restrictions on the Ownership of and Ability to Transfer our Class A
	Common Stock.






	        Among other things, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to the exceptions and the constructive ownership rules
	described herein, no person may own, or be deemed to own, in excess of (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or
	number (whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of any class of our common stock.




	        In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation prohibits (i) any person from transferring shares of our capital stock if such transfer would result in shares of our capital stock
	being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, and (ii) any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock if such ownership would result in us
	failing to qualify as a REIT.




	        These
	ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction in which stockholders might receive a
	premium for their shares of our capital stock over the then prevailing market price or which stockholders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest.




	        Certain existing stockholders that currently hold in excess of 9.8% of the value of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock are exempt from the ownership
	limitations in our Certificate of Incorporation.

	Corporate Opportunity





	        Neither TowerBrook Capital Partners ("TowerBrook") nor GI Partners, our largest stockholders, has any obligation to offer us an
	opportunity to participate in business opportunities presented to TowerBrook or GI Partners even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued, and neither TowerBrook nor GI Partners
	will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities unless, in the case of any person who is our director or officer, such business opportunity is
	expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our officer or director. Stockholders will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our Certificate
	of Incorporation.






	Choice of Forum





	        Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of
	Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
	(c) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed
	by the internal affairs doctrine. However, several lawsuits involving other companies are currently pending challenging the validity of choice of forum provisions in certificates of
	incorporation, and it is possible that a court could rule that such provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar





	        The transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.






	New York Stock Exchange Listing





	        Our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "LADR."

	U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS






	        The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Class A common stock of
	Ladder. For purposes of this section under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations," references to "Ladder," "we," "our" and "us" generally mean only Ladder and not its subsidiaries or
	other lower tier entities, except as otherwise indicated. This summary is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"), rulings and other
	administrative pronouncements issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to
	change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described
	below. We have not sought and do not intend to seek an advance ruling from the IRS regarding our ability to qualify as a REIT. The summary is also based upon the assumption that we and our
	subsidiaries and affiliated entities will operate in accordance with our and their applicable organizational documents. This summary is for general information only and is not tax advice. It does not
	discuss any state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences relevant to us or an investment in our Class A common stock, and it does not purport to
	discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of its investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special tax rules, such
	as:






	




	financial institutions;








	




	insurance companies;








	




	broker-dealers;








	




	regulated investment companies;








	




	partnerships and trusts;








	




	persons who hold our stock on behalf of other persons as nominees;








	




	persons who receive our stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;








	




	persons holding our stock as part of a "straddle," "hedge," "conversion transaction," "synthetic security" or other integrated
	investment;






	and, except to the extent discussed below:






	




	tax-exempt organizations; and








	




	foreign investors.






	        This summary assumes that investors will hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset, which generally means as property held for investment.



	        


	The U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders of our stock depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of
	U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences to any particular stockholder of holding and disposing of our Class A
	common stock will depend on the stockholder's particular tax circumstances. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income and other tax
	consequences to you in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of our Class A common stock.

	Taxation of Ladder Capital Corp





	        We have been subject to tax as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that, commencing with
	such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such
	a manner to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT.




	        The law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP has acted as our tax counsel in connection with our election to be taxed as a REIT. We have received an opinion of
	Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP to the effect that, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2015, we have been organized in conformity with the requirements
	for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our actual method of operation has enabled us and our proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for
	qualification and taxation as a REIT. It must be emphasized that the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is based on various assumptions relating to our organization and
	operation, and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization, assets, and income, and the present and future conduct of our business
	operations. While we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the
	possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP or by us that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year.
	The opinion was expressed as of the date issued. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP has no obligation to advise us or our stockholders of any subsequent change in the matters
	stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS
	will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions.




	        Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and diversity of stock and asset
	ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code, the compliance with which will not be reviewed by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. Our ability to
	qualify as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests, some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. Such values may not be susceptible
	to a precise determination. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a
	REIT.







	Taxation of REITs in general






	        As indicated above, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various
	qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. The material qualification requirements are summarized below under "Requirements for qualificationGeneral." While
	we intend to operate so that we qualify as a REIT, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our qualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT
	requirements in the future. See "Failure to qualify."




	        Provided that we qualify as a REIT, we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable
	income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment
	in a corporation. In general, the income that we generate is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to our stockholders.




	        Currently, most U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at a maximum regular U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. With limited
	exceptions, however, dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as REITs are generally not eligible for




	19











	Table of Contents





	this rate and will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income. Under current law, the highest marginal non-corporate regular U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income
	is 39.6%. See "Taxation of stockholdersTaxation of taxable U.S. HoldersDistributions."




	        Any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as the capital
	gains that we recognize. See "Taxation of stockholdersTaxation of taxable U.S. HoldersDistributions." Provided we qualify as a REIT, we will nonetheless be
	subject to U.S. federal tax in the following circumstances:






	




	We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed net taxable income, including undistributed net capital gain.








	




	We may be subject to the "alternative minimum tax" on our items of tax preference, including any deductions of net operating losses.








	




	If we have net income from prohibited transactions, which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held
	primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property, such income will be subject to a 100% tax. See "Prohibited transactions," and
	"Foreclosure property," below.








	




	If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as
	"foreclosure property," we may thereby avoid the 100% tax on gain from a resale of that property (if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction), but the income from the sale or
	operation of the property may be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate (currently 35%).








	




	If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as discussed below, but nonetheless maintain our
	qualification as a REIT because we satisfy other requirements, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount based on the magnitude of the failure, as adjusted to reflect the profit margin associated
	with our gross income.








	




	If we violate the asset tests (other than certain



	de minimis



	violations) or other
	requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, and yet maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may
	be subject to a penalty tax. In that case, the amount of the penalty tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will be determined as the amount of net
	income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate (currently 35%) if that amount exceeds $50,000 per failure.








	




	If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year;
	(ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year; and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the
	excess of the required distribution over the sum of: (a) the amounts that we actually distributed and (b) the amounts we retained and upon which we paid income tax at the corporate
	level.








	




	We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record-keeping
	requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT's stockholders, as described below in "Requirements for
	qualificationGeneral."








	




	A 100% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a "taxable REIT subsidiary" ("TRS") that do not reflect arm's-length terms.








	




	If we sell any of our existing appreciated assets or if we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT
	(i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Code) in a

	in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter C corporation, we may be
	subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year
	period following their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation.






	




	The earnings of our TRSs will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent that such subsidiaries are
	subchapter C corporations.






	        In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of other taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property and other taxes on our assets and
	operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated.







	Requirements for qualificationGeneral






	        The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:






	1.




	that
	is managed by one or more trustees or directors;






	2.




	the
	beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;






	3.




	that
	would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for its election to be subject to tax as a REIT;






	4.




	that
	is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the Code.






	5.




	the
	beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons;






	6.




	in
	which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer
	"individuals" (as defined in the Code to include specified tax-exempt entities); and






	7.




	that
	meets other tests described below, including with respect to the nature of its income and assets.






	        The Code provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year, and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a
	taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Conditions (5) and (6) need not be met during a corporation's initial tax year as a REIT
	(which, in our case, was 2015). Our Certificate of Incorporation provides restrictions regarding the ownership and transfers of our stock, which are intended to assist us in satisfying the stock
	ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above.




	        To monitor compliance with the stock ownership requirements, we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our stock. To do so, we must demand written
	statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the stock (i.e., the persons
	required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to
	monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements. If you fail or refuse to comply with the demands, you will be required by Treasury regulations to submit a statement
	with your tax return disclosing your actual ownership of our stock and other information.




	        In addition, a corporation generally may not elect to become a REIT unless its taxable year is the calendar year. We adopted December 31 as our year-end, and thereby satisfy this
	requirement.

	Effect of subsidiary entities







	        Ownership of partnership interests.



	    We are a partner in entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	(e.g., directly in our Series REIT operating partnership and indirectly through our TRS in our Series TRS operating partnership). Treasury regulations provide that we are deemed to own our
	proportionate share of our Series REIT operating partnership's assets, and to earn our proportionate share of such partnership's income, for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to
	REITs. Our proportionate share of our Series REIT operating partnership's assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership (except that for purposes of the 10% value test,
	described below, our proportionate share of the partnership's assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership). In addition, the
	assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our hands. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships
	generally will be treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the REIT requirements.




	        We generally have control of our operating partnerships and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the
	requirements for our qualification as a REIT. If we become a limited partner or non-managing member in any partnership or limited liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions
	that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or limited liability
	company could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or
	limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could fail to qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below.





	        Disregarded subsidiaries.



	    If we own a corporate subsidiary that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary," that subsidiary is generally disregarded
	for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes, and all of the subsidiary's assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit,
	including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs. A qualified REIT subsidiary is any corporation, other than a TRS (as described below), that is directly or indirectly
	wholly-owned by a REIT. Other entities that are wholly-owned by us, including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, are also generally disregarded as separate entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests. Disregarded subsidiaries, along with any
	partnerships in which we hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to herein as "pass-through subsidiaries."




	        In the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly-ownedfor example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a person other than us or
	another disregarded subsidiary of oursthe subsidiary's separate existence would no longer be disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, the subsidiary would have multiple
	owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation. Such an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross
	income requirements applicable to REITs, including the requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another corporation. See
	"Asset tests" and "Income tests."





	        Taxable subsidiaries.



	    In general, we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation, whether or not wholly-owned (including a corporation
	owned by
	our operating partnership), to treat such subsidiary corporation as a TRS. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value,
	unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other taxable corporation is not ignored for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly,
	a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation generally




	22











	Table of Contents





	is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its earnings, which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate, and may reduce our ability to make distributions
	to our stockholders.




	        We are not treated as holding the assets of a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns. Rather, the stock issued by a taxable
	subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary, if any, as income. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as
	described below. Because we do not include the assets and income of TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations on a look-through basis in determining our compliance with the REIT requirements, we
	may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs or other
	taxable subsidiary corporations to perform services or conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or to conduct activities that, if conducted by us
	directly, would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions.




	        The TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. Further,
	the rules impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or the REIT's tenants that are not
	conducted on an arm's-length basis. We intend that all of our transactions with our TRSs, if any, will be conducted on an arm's-length basis.







	Income tests






	        To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for
	each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in "prohibited transactions," discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived
	from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed
	securities), "rents from real property," dividends received from other REITs, and gains from the sale of real property, mortgages on real property, and shares in other REITs, as well as specified
	income from temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging
	transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or
	disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator
	for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests.





	        Interest income.



	    Interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test (as described above)
	to the
	extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property. If we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real
	property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or
	originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will generally be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the
	75% gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property. See "Interest and REMIC apportionment." Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or is
	undersecured (such that all or a portion of the interest thereon does not qualify for the 75% gross income test), the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% gross
	income test.




	23





















	Table of Contents





	        We may invest in Agency and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities that are either mortgage pass-through certificates or CMOs. We expect that such mortgage-backed
	securities will be treated either as interests in a grantor trust or as interests in a real estate mortgage investment conduit, or a "REMIC," for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of
	mortgage-backed securities treated as interests in grantor trusts, we would be treated as owning an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust. The
	interest on such mortgage loans would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test to the extent that the obligation is secured by real property, as discussed above. In the case of
	mortgage-backed securities treated as interests in a REMIC, income derived from REMIC interests will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income tests. If less than
	95% of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets, however, then only a proportionate part of our interest in the REMIC and income derived from the interest will qualify for purposes of the 75%
	gross income test. In addition, some REMIC securitizations include imbedded interest swap or cap contracts or other derivative instruments that potentially could produce non-qualifying income for the
	holder of the related REMIC securities. We expect that substantially all of our income from mortgage-backed securities will be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.





	        Dividend income.



	    We may directly or indirectly receive distributions from TRSs or other corporations that are not REITs or qualified REIT
	subsidiaries. These distributions generally are treated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation. Such distributions will generally constitute
	qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any dividends that we receive from a REIT, however, will be qualifying income for
	purposes of both the 95% and 75% gross income tests.





	        Interest and REMIC apportionment.



	    The interest apportionment tax rules generally provide that, if a mortgage is secured by both real
	property and
	other property, the REIT is required to apportion its annual interest income between the portion attributable to a mortgage on the real property and the portion attributable to other property (which
	is not treated as mortgage interest). The interest apportionment tax regulations apply only if the mortgage loan in question is secured by both real property and other property. We expect that all or
	most of the mortgage loans that we acquire will be secured only by real property and no other property value is taken into account in our underwriting process. In addition, in certain cases, personal
	property collateral securing a loan that we hold may be treated as real property for purposes of the foregoing rules.




	        In addition, the Code provides that a regular or a residual interest in a REMIC is generally treated as a real estate asset for the purpose of the REIT asset tests, and any amount
	includible in our gross income with respect to such an interest is generally treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the REIT gross income tests.
	If, however, less than 95% of the assets of a REMIC in which we hold an interest consist of real estate assets (determined as if we held such assets), we will be treated as receiving directly our
	proportionate share of the income of the REMIC for the purpose of determining the amount of income from the REMIC that is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property.
	In connection with the expanded HARP program, the IRS issued guidance providing that, among other things, if a REIT holds a regular interest in an "eligible REMIC," or a residual interest in an
	"eligible REMIC" that informs the REIT that at least 80% of the REMIC's assets constitute real estate assets, then the REIT may treat 80% of the gross income received with respect to the interest in
	the REMIC as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the 75% gross income test. For this purpose, a REMIC is an "eligible REMIC" if: (i) the REMIC
	has received a guarantee from the FNMA or the FHLMC that will allow the REMIC to make any principal and interest payments on its regular and residual interests; and (ii) all of the REMIC's
	mortgages and pass-through certificates are secured by interests in single-family dwellings. If we were to acquire an interest in an eligible REMIC less than 95% of the assets of which constitute real
	estate assets, the IRS guidance described above may




	24











	Table of Contents





	generally allow us to treat 80% of the gross income derived from the interest as qualifying income for the purposes of 75% REIT gross income test. Although the portion of the income from such a REMIC
	interest that does not qualify would likely be qualifying income for the purpose of the 95% REIT gross
	income test, the remaining 20% of the REMIC interest generally would not qualify as a real estate asset, which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT asset tests.





	        Fee income.



	    Fees will generally be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests if they are received in
	consideration
	for entering into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property and the fees are not determined by income and profits. Other fees generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of either
	gross income test. Any fees earned by a TRS, however, will not be included for purposes of the gross income tests.





	        Hedging transactions.



	    Any income or gain that we or our pass-through subsidiaries derive from instruments that hedge certain specified
	risks will be
	excluded from gross income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met, including the requirement that the instrument is entered into during
	the ordinary course of our business and that the instrument be properly identified as a hedge along with the risk that it hedges within prescribed time periods. Income and gain from all other hedging
	transactions will not be qualifying income for either the 95% or 75% gross income test. See "Derivatives and Hedging Transactions."





	        Failure to satisfy the gross income tests.



	    If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we
	may still
	qualify as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will generally be available if: (i) our failure to meet these tests
	was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; and (ii) following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test for any taxable year, we file a
	schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test for such taxable year in accordance with Treasury regulations yet to be issued. It is
	not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances, we
	will not qualify as a REIT. Even where these relief provisions apply, the Code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test.





	        Timing differences between receipt of cash and recognition of income.



	    Due to the nature of the assets in which we will invest, we may be
	required to
	recognize taxable income from those assets in advance of our receipt of cash flow on or proceeds from disposition of such assets, and may be required to report taxable income in early periods that
	exceeds the economic income ultimately realized on such assets.




	        We may acquire mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market for less than their face amount. In addition, pursuant to our ownership of certain mortgage-backed securities, we may be
	treated as
	holding certain debt instruments acquired in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The discount at which such securities or debt instruments are acquired may reflect doubts about their
	ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount may nevertheless generally be treated as "market discount" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accrued
	market discount is generally recognized as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal on the mortgage-backed security or debt instrument is made. If we collect less on the
	mortgage-backed security or debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions.




	        Moreover, some of the mortgage-backed securities that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. In general, we will be required to accrue original issue discount
	based on the constant yield to maturity of the securities, and to treat it as taxable income in accordance with applicable U.S. federal income tax rules even though smaller or no cash payments are
	received on such




	25











	Table of Contents





	securities. As in the case of the market discount discussed in the preceding paragraph, the constant yield in question will be determined and we will be taxed based on the assumption that all future
	payments due on the mortgage-backed securities in question will be made, with consequences similar to those described in the previous paragraph if all payments on the securities are not made.




	        In addition, pursuant to our ownership of certain mortgage-backed securities, we may be treated as holding distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with
	the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a
	debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower. In that event, we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the
	unmodified debt, even if the value of the debt or the payment expectations have not changed. Following such a taxable modification, we would hold the modified loan with a cost basis equal to its
	principal amount for U.S. federal tax purposes. To the extent that such modifications are made with respect to a debt instrument held by a TRS that is treated as a dealer or trader and that makes an
	election to use mark-to-market accounting, such TRS would be required at the end of each taxable year, including the taxable year in which any such modification were made, to mark the modified debt
	instrument to its fair market value as if the debt instrument were sold. In that case, the TRS could recognize a loss at the end of the taxable year in which the modifications were made to the extent
	that the fair market value of such debt instrument at such time was less than the instrument's tax basis.




	        In addition, in the event mortgage-backed securities, or any debt instruments we are treated as holding pursuant to our investments in mortgage-backed securities, are delinquent as to
	mandatory principal and interest payments, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability.
	Similarly, we may be
	required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate mortgage-backed securities at the stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received.




	        Finally, we may be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of
	recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	        Due to each of these potential timing differences between income recognition or expense deduction and cash receipts or disbursements, there is a significant risk that we may have
	substantial taxable income in excess of cash available for distribution. In that event, we may need to borrow funds or take other action to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements for the taxable
	year in which this "phantom income" is recognized. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital CorpAnnual distribution requirements."







	Asset tests






	        At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the
	value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of "real estate assets," cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments
	purchased with new capital. For this purpose, real estate assets include some kinds of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans, as well as interests in real property (and certain ancillary
	personal property), stock of other corporations that qualify as REITs, and debt instruments (whether or not secured by real property) that are issued by a "publicly offered REIT"
	(



	i.e.



	, a REIT that is required to file annual and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934). Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below.




	        Second, the value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.




	26











	Table of Contents





	        Third, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs
	and
	qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% asset test does not apply to "straight debt" having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. Solely for purposes of the 10%
	asset test, the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities
	issued by the partnership or limited liability company, excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the Code.




	        Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold may not exceed 25% (or, for our 2018 and subsequent taxable years, 20%) of the value of our total assets.




	        Fifth, no more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by "nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments" (i.e., real estate assets that would cease to
	be real estate assets if debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs were not included in the definition of real estate assets).




	        Notwithstanding the general rule, as noted above, that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate share of the underlying assets of a
	subsidiary partnership, if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying
	mortgage asset or other conditions are met. Similarly, although stock of another REIT is a qualifying asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, any non-mortgage debt that is issued by a non-publicly
	offered REIT may not so qualify (such debt, however, will not be treated as "securities" for purposes of the 10% asset test, as explained below).




	        Certain securities will not cause a violation of the 10% asset test described above. Such securities include instruments that constitute "straight debt," which term generally excludes,
	among other things, securities having contingency features. A security does not qualify as "straight debt" where a REIT (or a controlled TRS of the REIT) owns other securities of the same issuer which
	do not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitute, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer's outstanding securities. In addition to straight
	debt, the Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% asset test. Such securities include: (i) any loan made to an individual or an estate; (ii) certain rental
	agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain persons related to the REIT under attribution rules);
	(iii) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (iv) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of (or payments made by) a
	non-governmental entity; (v) any security (including debt securities) issued by another REIT; and (vi) any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnership's income is of a
	nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under "Income tests." In applying the 10% asset test, a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into
	account to the extent, if any, of the REIT's proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership.




	        We invest in Agency and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities that are either mortgage pass-through certificates or CMOs. We expect that these securities will be treated either as
	interests in grantor trusts or as interests in REMICs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of mortgage-backed securities treated as interests in grantor trusts, we would be treated as
	owning an undivided beneficial
	ownership interest in the mortgage loans held by the grantor trust. Such mortgage loans will generally qualify as real estate assets to the extent that they are secured by real property. We expect
	that substantially all of our mortgage-backed securities treated as interests in grantor trusts will qualify as real estate assets.




	        In the case of mortgage-backed securities treated as interests in a REMIC, such interests will generally qualify as real estate assets. If less than 95% of the assets of a REMIC are real
	estate assets, however, then only a proportionate part of our interest in the REMIC and income derived from the




	27











	Table of Contents





	interest will qualify for purposes of the REIT asset tests. In connection with the expanded HARP program, the IRS issued guidance providing that, among other things, if a REIT holds a regular interest
	in an "eligible REMIC," or a residual interest in an "eligible REMIC" that informs the REIT that at least 80% of the REMIC's assets constitute real estate assets, then the REIT may treat 80% of the
	value of the interest in the REMIC as a real estate asset for the purpose of the REIT asset tests. For this purpose, a REMIC is an "eligible REMIC" if: (i) the REMIC has received a guarantee
	from the FNMA or the FHLMC that will allow the REMIC to make any principal and interest payments on its regular and residual interests; and (ii) all of the REMIC's mortgages and pass-through
	certificates are secured by interests in single-family dwellings. If we were to acquire an interest in an eligible REMIC less than 95% of the assets of which constitute real estate assets, the IRS
	guidance described above may generally allow us to treat 80% of our interest in such a REMIC as a qualifying real estate asset for the purpose of the REIT asset tests. The remaining 20% of the REMIC
	interest generally would not qualify as a real estate asset, which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT asset tests.




	        If we hold a "residual interest" in a REMIC from which we derive "excess inclusion income," we will be required to either distribute the excess inclusion income or pay tax on it (or a
	combination of the two), even though we may not receive the income in cash. To the extent that distributed excess inclusion income is allocable to a particular stockholder, the income:
	(i) would not be allowed to be offset by any net operating losses otherwise available to the stockholder; (ii) would be subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income in the hands
	of most types of stockholders that are otherwise generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax; and (iii) would result in the application of U.S. federal income tax withholding at the maximum
	rate (30%), without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty or other exemption, to the extent allocable to most types of foreign stockholders. Moreover, any excess inclusion
	income that we receive that is allocable to specified categories of tax-exempt investors which are not subject to unrelated business income tax, such as government entities or charitable remainder
	trusts, may be subject to corporate-level income tax in our hands, whether or not it is distributed.




	        We enter into sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell certain of our mortgage-backed securities to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to
	repurchase
	the sold assets in exchange for a purchase price that reflects a financing charge. Economically, these agreements are financings, which are secured by the securities "sold" pursuant thereto. We
	believe that we will be treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the securities that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer
	record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the mortgage-backed securities during the
	term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT.




	        No independent appraisals have been obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or securities. Moreover, values of
	some assets, including instruments issued in securitization transactions, may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future. Furthermore, the proper
	classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements.
	Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT asset tests.




	        However, certain relief provisions are available to allow REITs to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and
	other requirements. One such provision allows a REIT which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if: (i) the REIT provides the IRS with a
	description of each asset causing the failure; (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect; (iii) the REIT




	28











	Table of Contents





	pays a tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 per failure, and (b) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest applicable
	corporate tax rate (currently 35%); and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure,
	or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame.




	        In the case of



	de minimis



	violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests, a REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such
	requirements if: (i) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT's total assets and $10,000,000; and (ii) the REIT either disposes of the
	assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame.




	        If we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we: (i) satisfied the asset
	tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter; and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset requirements
	was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets, but instead arose from changes in the market value of our assets. If the condition described in (ii) were not
	satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of relief provisions
	described below.







	Annual distribution requirements






	        In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our stockholders in an
	amount at least equal to:






	(a)




	the
	sum of:






	(i)




	90%
	of our net taxable income, computed without regard to our net capital gain and the deduction for dividends paid, and






	(ii)




	90%
	of our net income, if any, (after tax) from foreclosure property (as described below), minus








	(b)




	the
	sum of specified items of non-cash income.






	        We generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if
	paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration.




	        To the extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our net taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained
	portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains. In this case, we could elect for our stockholders to include their proportionate
	shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that
	we paid. Our stockholders would then increase their adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between: (a) the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include
	in their taxable income, and (b) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income.




	        To the extent that in the future we may have available net operating losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in
	order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Such losses, however, will generally not affect the character, in the hands of our stockholders, of any distributions that are actually made as
	ordinary dividends or capital gains. See "Taxation of stockholdersTaxation of taxable U.S. HoldersDistributions."




	29











	Table of Contents





	        If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year; (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for
	such year; and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the
	sum of: (a) the amounts actually distributed, plus (b) the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid U.S. federal corporate income tax.




	        As discussed above under "Income testsTiming differences between receipt of cash and recognition of income," it is possible that, from time to time, we may not
	have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between our actual receipt of cash and our inclusion of items in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
	the event that such timing differences occur, in order to meet the distribution requirements, it might be necessary for us to arrange for short-term, or possibly long-term, borrowings, or to pay
	dividends in the form of taxable in-kind distributions of property. Alternatively, we may declare a taxable dividend payable in cash or stock at the election of each stockholder, where the aggregate
	amount of cash to be distributed in such dividend may be subject to limitation. In such case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to
	include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.




	        We may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying "deficiency dividends" to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our
	deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. In this case, we may be able to avoid losing REIT qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject to the 4%
	excise tax described above. We will be required to pay interest based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends.







	Prohibited transactions






	        Net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. The term "prohibited transaction" generally includes
	a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business
	by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us. We intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will
	be treated as, or as having been, held as inventory or for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business. Whether
	property is held as inventory or "primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business" depends on the particular facts and circumstances. No assurance can be given that any
	property that we sell will not be treated as inventory or property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment.
	The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at
	regular corporate rates. We intend to structure our activities to avoid prohibited transaction characterization.







	Foreclosure property






	        Foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property: (i) that we acquire as the
	result of having bid in the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after a default (or upon imminent default) on a
	lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property; (ii) for which we acquired the related loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated; and
	(iii) with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property. We generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate (currently




	30











	Table of Contents





	35%) on any net income from foreclosure property, including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the
	75% gross income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the 100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described
	above, even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property. Because we will
	invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities, we do not anticipate receiving any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test.







	Derivatives and hedging transactions






	        We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on one or more of our assets or liabilities. Any such
	hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward
	contracts, and options. Except to the extent provided by Treasury regulations, any income from a hedging transaction (including gain from the sale, disposition, or termination of a position in such a
	transaction) will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test if we properly identify the transaction as specified in applicable Treasury regulations and we enter into
	such transaction (i) in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary
	obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets; (ii) primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be
	qualifying income under the 75% or 95% income tests; or (iii) in connection with the extinguishment of indebtedness with respect to which we have entered into a qualified hedging position
	described in clause (i) or the disposition of property with respect to which we have entered into a qualified hedging position described in clause (ii), primarily to manage the risks of
	such hedging positions. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both
	of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that will not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. We may conduct some or all of our hedging
	activities (including hedging activities relating to currency risk) through a TRS or other corporate entity, the income from which may be subject to U.S. federal income tax, rather than by
	participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. No assurance can be given, however, that our hedging activities will not give rise to income that does not qualify for
	purposes of either or both of the REIT gross income tests, or that our hedging activities will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements.







	Taxable mortgage pools and excess inclusion income






	        An entity, or a portion of an entity, may be classified as a taxable mortgage pool, or a "TMP", under the Code
	if:






	




	substantially all of its assets consist of debt obligations or interests in debt obligations,








	




	more than 50% of those debt obligations are real estate mortgages or interests in real estate mortgages as of specified testing dates,








	




	the entity has issued debt obligations (liabilities) that have two or more maturities, and








	




	the payments required to be made by the entity on its debt obligations (liabilities) "bear a relationship" to the payments to be
	received by the entity on the debt obligations that it holds as assets.






	        Under Treasury regulations, if less than 80% of the assets of an entity (or a portion of an entity) consist of debt obligations, these debt obligations are considered not to comprise
	"substantially all" of its assets, and therefore the entity would not be treated as a TMP. Our financing and securitization arrangements may give rise to TMPs, with the consequences as described
	below.




	31





















	Table of Contents





	        Where an entity, or a portion of an entity, is classified as a TMP, it is generally treated as a taxable corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the
	case of a REIT, or a portion of a REIT, or a disregarded subsidiary of a REIT, that is a TMP, however, special rules apply. The TMP is not treated as a corporation that is subject to U.S. federal
	corporate income tax, and the TMP classification does not adversely affect the qualification of the REIT. Rather, the consequences of the TMP classification would, in general, except as described
	below, be limited to the stockholders of the REIT.




	        A portion of the REIT's income from the TMP arrangement could be treated as "excess inclusion income." The REIT's excess inclusion income, including any excess inclusion income from a
	residual interest in a REMIC, must be allocated among its stockholders in proportion to dividends paid. The REIT is required to notify stockholders of the amount of "excess inclusion income" allocated
	to them. A stockholder's share of excess inclusion income:






	




	cannot be offset by any net operating losses otherwise available to the stockholder,








	




	is subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income in the hands of most types of stockholders that are otherwise generally exempt
	from U.S. federal income tax, and








	




	results in the application of U.S. federal income tax withholding at the maximum rate (30%), without reduction for any otherwise
	applicable income tax treaty or other exemption, to the extent allocable to most types of foreign stockholders.






	        See "Taxation of stockholders." To the extent that excess inclusion income is allocated to a tax-exempt stockholder of a REIT that is not subject to unrelated business
	income tax (such as a government entity or charitable remainder trust), the REIT may be subject to tax on this income at the highest applicable corporate tax rate (currently 35%). In that case, the
	REIT could reduce distributions to such stockholders by the amount of such tax paid by the REIT attributable to such stockholder's ownership. Treasury regulations provide that such a reduction in
	distributions does not give rise to a preferential dividend that could adversely affect the REIT's compliance with its distribution requirements. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital
	CorpAnnual distribution requirements."




	        The manner in which excess inclusion income is calculated, or would be allocated to stockholders, including allocations among shares of different classes of stock, is not clear under
	current law. As required by IRS guidance, we intend to make such determinations using a reasonable method. Tax-exempt investors, foreign investors and taxpayers with net operating losses should
	carefully consider the tax consequences described above, and are urged to consult their tax advisors.




	        If a subsidiary partnership of ours that we do not wholly-own, directly or through one or more disregarded entities, were a TMP, the foregoing rules would not apply. Rather, the
	partnership that is a TMP would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and potentially would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax or withholding tax. In addition,
	this characterization would alter our income and asset test calculations, and could adversely affect our compliance with those requirements. We intend to monitor the structure of any TMPs in which we
	have an interest to ensure that they will not adversely affect our qualification as a REIT.







	Asset-backed securities






	        Investments in asset-backed securities, or "ABS", generally are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test applicable to
	REITs and generally do not generate qualifying income for purposes of the 75% income test applicable to REITs. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to invest in such assets.




	32











	Table of Contents








	Failure to qualify






	        If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification other than the income or asset tests, we could avoid
	disqualification if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Relief provisions are available for failures of the income
	tests and asset tests, as described above in "Income tests" and "Asset tests."




	        If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above do not apply, we would be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative
	minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We cannot deduct distributions to stockholders in any year in which we are not a REIT, nor would we be required to make distributions in
	such a year. In this situation, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions to most domestic stockholders that are U.S. individuals, trusts or estates will generally
	be taxable at the preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% maximum regular federal rate) for qualified dividends. In addition, subject to the limitations of the Code, corporate distributees
	may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the
	four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we would be entitled to this statutory relief.






	Tax Aspects of Our Operating Partnerships and any Subsidiary Partnerships





	        All of our investments are held through two series of LCFH, Series REIT of LCFH and Series TRS of LCFH. Series REIT holds an interest
	in Series TRS through a TRS. In addition, our operating partnerships may hold certain of their investments indirectly through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies which we expect
	will be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes are "pass-through" entities which are not required to pay U.S. federal income tax. Rather, partners or members of such entities are allocated their shares of the items of income, gain, loss,
	deduction and credit of the partnership or limited liability company, and are potentially required to pay tax on this income, without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership
	or limited liability company. We will include in our income our share of these partnership and limited liability company items for purposes of the various gross income tests, the computation of our
	REIT taxable income, and the REIT distribution requirements. Moreover, for purposes of the asset tests, we will include our pro rata share of assets held by our operating partnerships, including their
	share of their subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies, based on our capital interest in each such entity. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital Corp."







	Entity Classification






	        Our interests in our operating partnerships and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax
	considerations, including the possibility that the IRS might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships (or disregarded entities), as opposed to associations taxable as corporations for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes. If our operating partnerships or a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company were treated as an association, they would be taxable as a corporation and
	would be required to pay an entity-level tax on their income. In addition, the IRS could challenge the treatment of our series partnerships as separate entities. In this situation, the character of
	our assets and items of gross income would change and could prevent us from satisfying the REIT asset tests and possibly the REIT income tests. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital
	CorpAsset tests" and "Income tests." This, in turn, could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. See "Failure to qualify" for a discussion of the effect of our
	failure to meet these tests. In addition, a change in the tax status or tax treatment of our operating partnerships, a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company might be treated as a taxable
	event. If so, we might incur a distribution




	33











	Table of Contents





	requirement or tax liability without any related cash distributions. We believe that our operating partnerships and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies (for which we do not
	make an election to be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes) will be classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.







	Allocations of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction






	        A partnership agreement (or, in the case of a limited liability company treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	the limited liability company agreement) will generally determine the allocation of partnership income and loss among partners. Generally, Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury
	regulations thereunder require that partnership allocations respect the economic arrangement of the partners. If an allocation of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of
	Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. This
	reallocation will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. Our operating partnerships'
	allocations of taxable income and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder.







	New Partnership Audit Rules






	        The recently enacted Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changes the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships (such
	as our operating partnership). Under the new rules (which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017), among other changes and subject to certain exceptions,
	any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable
	thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in our operating partnership or
	other partnerships in which we directly or indirect invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of
	these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional
	corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment. The changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future
	regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Treasury. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and their potential impact on their investment in our common stock.






	Taxation of stockholders








	Taxation of taxable U.S. Holders






	        As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a holder of our Class A common stock who for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	is:






	




	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;








	




	a corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States or
	under the laws of the United States, or of any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;








	




	an estate, the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or








	




	a trust if (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S.
	fiduciaries have the authority to control all substantial decisions of






	34











	Table of Contents







	the
	trust, or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.






	        If
	a partnership, including for this purpose any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our Class A common stock, the
	tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. An investor that is a partnership and the partners in such
	partnership should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock.





	        Distributions.



	    So long as we qualify as a REIT, the distributions that we make to our U.S. Holders out of current or accumulated earnings
	and profits
	that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by such stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for
	corporations. With limited exceptions, our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% maximum regular U.S. federal rate) for qualified dividends
	received by most domestic U.S. Holders that are individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. Such U.S. Holders, however, are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by
	and received from REITs to the extent that the dividends are attributable to:






	




	income retained by the REIT in the prior taxable year on which the REIT was subject to corporate level income tax (less the amount of
	tax);








	




	dividends received by the REIT from TRSs or other taxable C corporations; or








	




	income in the prior taxable year from the sales of "built-in gain" property acquired by the REIT from C corporations in carryover
	basis transactions (less the amount of corporate tax on such income).






	        Distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends generally will be taxed to our U.S. Holders as long-term capital gains, to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our
	actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the U.S. Holder that receives such distribution has held its stock. We may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or
	all of our net long-term capital gains, in which case provisions of the Code will treat our U.S. Holders as having received, solely for tax purposes, our undistributed capital gains, and the U.S.
	Holders will receive a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital CorpAnnual distribution requirements."
	Corporate U.S. Holders may be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are generally taxable at maximum regular U.S. federal rates of 20%
	in the case of stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates, and 35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations. Capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held
	for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum regular U.S. federal income tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals, to the extent of previously claimed depreciation
	deductions.




	        Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a U.S. Holder to the extent that the
	amount of such distributions does not exceed the adjusted basis of the U.S. Holder's shares in respect of which the distributions were made. Rather, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of
	the U.S. Holder's shares. To the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a U.S. Holder's shares, such holder generally must include such distributions in income as long-term
	capital gain, or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less. In addition, any dividend that we declare in October, November or December of any year and that is payable
	to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we actually pay
	the dividend before the end of January of the following calendar year.




	35











	Table of Contents





	        To the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in
	order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See "Taxation of Ladder Capital CorpAnnual distribution requirements." Such losses, however, are not passed through
	to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources, nor would such losses
	affect the character of any distributions that we make, which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits.





	        Dispositions of Ladder stock.



	    If a U.S. Holder sells or disposes of shares of our stock, it will generally recognize gain or loss for U.S.
	federal
	income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition and the stockholder's adjusted
	tax basis in the shares of Ladder stock. In general, capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts or estates upon the sale or disposition of our stock will be subject to a maximum regular U.S.
	federal income tax rate of 20% if the stock is held for more than one year, and will be taxed at ordinary income rates (of up to 39.6%) if the stock is held for one year or less. Gains recognized by
	U.S. Holders that are corporations are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 35%, whether or not such gains are classified as long-term capital gains. Capital losses recognized by a
	U.S. Holder upon the disposition of our stock that was held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses, and capital losses are generally available
	only to offset capital gain income of the U.S. Holder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon
	a sale or exchange of shares of our stock by a U.S. Holder who has held the shares for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the
	extent of distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain.




	        If an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of
	Treasury regulations involving "reportable transactions" could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These regulations, though directed
	towards "tax shelters," are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters. The Code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these
	requirements. You should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might
	undertake directly or indirectly. Moreover, you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved (including their advisors) might be subject to disclosure or
	other requirements pursuant to these regulations.





	        Passive activity losses and investment interest limitations.



	    Distributions that we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a
	U.S. Holder
	will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. Holders will not be able to apply any "passive losses" against income or gain relating to our stock. To the extent that distributions
	we make do not constitute a return of capital, they will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation.







	Taxation of foreign stockholders






	        The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock by persons that
	are, for purposes of such taxation, nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships or foreign estates or trusts (collectively, "Non-U.S. Holders") are complex, and no
	attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules. Accordingly, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax law and does not address state, local or
	foreign tax consequences that may be relevant to a Non-U.S. Holder in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion is based on current law, which is subject to change, and
	assumes that Ladder will qualify for taxation as a REIT. Non-U.S. Holders should consult




	36











	Table of Contents





	their tax advisors to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws with regard to the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock (including reporting
	requirements) in light of their individual circumstances.





	        Ordinary dividends.



	    The portion of dividends received by Non-U.S. Holders that is: (i) payable out of our earnings and profits;
	(ii) which is not attributable to our capital gains; and (iii) which is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder, will be subject to U.S.
	withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless reduced or eliminated by treaty.




	        In general, Non-U.S. Holders will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our stock. In cases where the dividend income from
	a Non-U.S. Holder's investment in our stock is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to
	U.S. federal income tax at graduated rates, in the same manner as domestic stockholders are taxed with respect to such dividends. Such income must generally be reported on a U.S. income tax return
	filed by or on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder. The income may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation.





	        Non-dividend distributions.



	    Unless our stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (a "USRPI"),
	distributions that we make which are not dividends out of our earnings and profits will not be subject to U.S. income tax. If we cannot determine at the time a distribution is made whether or not the
	distribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to dividends. The Non-U.S. Holder may seek a refund from
	the IRS of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. If our stock constitutes a USRPI, as
	described below, distributions that we make in excess of the sum of: (a) the stockholder's proportionate share of our earnings and profits, plus (b) the stockholder's basis in its stock,
	will be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, at the rate of tax, including any applicable capital gains rates, that would apply to a domestic stockholder of
	the same type (e.g., an individual or a corporation, as the case may be), and the collection of the tax will be enforced by a withholding at a rate of 15% of the amount by which the
	distribution exceeds the stockholder's share of our earnings and profits.





	        Capital gain dividends.



	    Under FIRPTA, a distribution that we make to a Non-U.S. Holder, to the extent attributable to gains from
	dispositions of
	USRPIs that we held directly or through pass-through subsidiaries, or USRPI capital gains, will, except as described below, be considered effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the
	Non-U.S. Holder and will be subject to U.S. income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. individuals or corporations, without regard to whether we designate the distribution as a capital gain dividend.
	See above under "Taxation of foreign stockholdersOrdinary dividends," for a discussion of the consequences of income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
	business. In addition, we will be required to withhold tax equal to 35% of the maximum amount that could have been designated as USRPI capital gains dividends. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also
	be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation. A distribution is not attributable to USRPI capital gain if we held an interest in the underlying asset
	solely as a creditor. Capital gain dividends received by a Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to dispositions of our assets other than USRPIs are not subject to U.S. federal income or withholding
	tax, unless: (i) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. trade or business, in which case the Non-U.S. Holder would be subject to the same treatment as U.S. holders
	with respect to such gain; or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a "tax
	home" in the United States, in which case the Non-U.S. Holder will incur a 30% tax on his capital gains. We do not expect that a significant portion of our assets will be USRPIs.




	37











	Table of Contents





	        A capital gain dividend that would otherwise have been treated as a USRPI capital gain will not be so treated or be subject to FIRPTA, and generally will not be treated as income that is
	effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and instead will generally be treated in the same manner as an ordinary dividend (see "Taxation of foreign
	stockholdersOrdinary dividends"), if: (i) the capital gain dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market
	located in the United States; and (ii) the recipient Non-U.S. Holder does not own more than 10% of that class of stock at any time during the year ending on the
	date on which the capital gain dividend is received. We anticipate that our Class A common stock will be "regularly traded" on an established securities exchange.





	        Dispositions of Ladder stock.



	    Unless our stock constitutes a USRPI, a sale of our stock by a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject
	to U.S.
	taxation under FIRPTA. Our stock will be treated as a USRPI if 50% or more of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the United States,
	excluding, for this purpose, interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor. It is not currently anticipated that our stock will constitute a USRPI. However, we cannot assure you that
	our stock will not become a USRPI.




	        Even if the foregoing 50% test is met, our stock will not constitute a USRPI if we are a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." A domestically controlled qualified
	investment entity includes a REIT, less than 50% of the value of which is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. Holders at all times during a specified testing period (after applying certain
	presumptions regarding the ownership of our stock, as described in the Code). We believe that we will be and will remain a domestically controlled qualified investment entity, and that a sale of our
	stock should not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. However, no assurance can be given that we will be or will remain a domestically controlled qualified investment entity.




	        In the event that we are not a domestically controlled qualified investment entity, but our stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established
	securities market, a Non-U.S. Holder's sale of our Class A common stock nonetheless also would not be subject to tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI, provided that the selling Non-U.S. Holder
	held 10% or less of our outstanding Class A common stock any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the sale. We expect that our Class A common stock will be regularly
	traded on an established securities market.




	        If gain on the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the Non-U.S. Holder would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and would be subject to the
	same treatment as a domestic stockholder with respect to such gain, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals,
	and the purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the IRS.




	        Gain from the sale of our stock that would not otherwise be subject to FIRPTA will nonetheless be taxable in the United States to a Non-U.S. Holder in two cases: (i) if the
	Non-U.S. Holder's investment in our stock is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S. Holder, the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to the same treatment as a
	domestic stockholder with respect to such gain; or (ii) if the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the
	taxable year and has a "tax home" in the United States, the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gain. In addition, even if we are a domestically
	controlled qualified investment entity, upon disposition of our stock (subject to the 10% exception applicable to "regularly traded" stock described above), a Non-U.S.
	Holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI if the Non-U.S. Holder: (i) disposes of our Class A common stock within a 30-day period preceding the
	ex-dividend date of a distribution, any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain




	38











	Table of Contents





	from the sale or exchange of a USRPI; and (ii) acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, other shares of our Class A common stock within 30 days after such
	ex-dividend date.





	        Special FIRPTA Rules.



	    Recently enacted amendments to FIPRTA create special rules that modify the application of the foregoing FIRPTA rules
	for
	particular types of foreign investors, including "qualified foreign pension funds" and their wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and certain widely held, publicly traded "qualified collective investment
	vehicles." Non-U.S. stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of these or any other special FIRPTA rules to their particular investment in our common stock.





	        Estate tax.



	    If our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as specially defined for U.S.
	federal estate
	tax purposes) of the United States at the time of such individual's death, the stock will be includable in the individual's gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable
	estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and may therefore be subject to U.S. federal estate tax.



	        


	Foreign stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning
	Ladder stock.








	Taxation of tax-exempt stockholders






	        Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts, generally are
	exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. However, they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income ("UBTI"). While some investments in real estate may generate UBTI, the IRS
	has ruled that dividend
	distributions from a REIT to a tax-exempt entity do not constitute UBTI. Based on that ruling, and provided that: (i) a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our stock as "debt financed property"
	within the meaning of the Code (i.e., where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt stockholder); and (ii) our stock is not otherwise
	used in an unrelated trade or business, distributions that we make and income from the sale of our stock generally should not give rise to UBTI to a tax-exempt stockholder.




	        Tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans exempt from
	U.S. federal income taxation under sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally require such stockholders to characterize
	distributions that we make as UBTI.




	        In certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock could be required to treat a percentage of the dividends as UBTI if we are a "pension-held REIT." We will
	not be a pension-held REIT unless: (i) we are required to "look through" one or more of our pension trust stockholders in order to satisfy the REIT "closely-held" test; and (ii) either
	(a) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (b) one or more pension trusts, each individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock, collectively
	owns more than 50% of the value of our stock. Certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock generally should prevent a tax-exempt entity from owning more than 10% of the value of our
	stock and generally should prevent us from becoming a pension-held REIT.



	        


	Tax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning
	Ladder stock.

	Other tax considerations








	Legislative or other actions affecting REITs






	        The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or
	administrative action at any time. The REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department which may result in
	statutory changes as well as revisions to regulations and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our Class A
	common stock.







	Medicare 3.8% tax on investment income






	        Certain U.S. holders who are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds are required to pay a 3.8%
	Medicare tax on their "net investment income," which includes dividends received from us and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of our Class A common stock.







	Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act






	        Withholding at a rate of 30% generally will be required on dividends, and, after December 31, 2018, gross proceeds from the sale
	of, our Class A common stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution (i) enters into an agreement with the
	Treasury to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to shares in the institution held by certain U.S. persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S.
	persons and to withhold on certain payments, or (ii) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and an applicable foreign country reports such information to its local
	tax authority, which will exchange such information with the U.S. authorities. Accordingly, the entity through which our Class A common stock is held will affect the determination of whether
	such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends, and, after December 31, 2018, gross proceeds from the sale of, our Class A common stock held by an investor that is a non-financial
	non-U.S. entity which does not qualify under certain exemptions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies that such entity does not have any
	"substantial United States owners" or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity's "substantial United States owners," which the applicable withholding agent will in turn provide to
	the Secretary of the Treasury. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. We will not pay any additional amounts to
	stockholders in respect of any amounts
	withheld. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding taxes on their investment in our Class A common stock.







	State, local and foreign taxes






	        We and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in
	which we or they transact business, own property or reside. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of our stockholders may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed
	above. Any foreign taxes that we incur do not pass through to stockholders as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors
	regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws on an investment in our stock.







	Backup withholding and information reporting






	        A stockholder may be subject to backup withholding and information reporting with respect to dividends, and with respect to amounts
	realized on the disposition of stock, unless the stockholder




	40











	Table of Contents





	provides the withholding agent with the applicable IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors as to their
	qualifications for an exemption for backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. In addition, payments to a Non-U.S. Holder and proceeds from certain dispositions of stock may
	be reported to the IRS and may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or other
	agreement. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a stockholder may be credited against the stockholder's U.S. federal
	income tax liability, if any, or refunded, if the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the
	information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        The Selling Stockholders, which as used herein includes donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling shares of
	our Class A common stock or interests in shares of our Class A common stock received after the date of this prospectus from the Selling Stockholders as a gift, pledge, partnership
	distribution or other transfer, may, from time to time, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of our Class A common stock or interests in shares of our
	Class A common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These dispositions may be at fixed prices, at prevailing market
	prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices.




	        The
	Selling Stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when disposing of shares or interests therein:






	




	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;








	




	one or more underwritten offerings;








	




	block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block
	as principal to facilitate the transaction;








	




	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;








	




	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;








	




	privately negotiated transactions;








	




	short sales effected after the date the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC;








	




	through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;








	




	broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; and








	




	a combination of any such methods of sale.






	        The
	Selling Stockholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of our Class A common stock owned by them and, if a Selling
	Stockholder defaults in the performance of its secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of our Class A common stock, from time to time, under this
	prospectus, or under an amendment or supplement to this prospectus amending the list of the Selling Stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as the Selling
	Stockholders under this prospectus. The Selling Stockholders also may transfer the shares of our Class A common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other
	successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.




	        In
	connection with the sale of our Class A common stock or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial
	institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of our Class A common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares of our
	Class A common stock short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge our Class A common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these
	securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which
	require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial Institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other

	Table of Contents





	financial
	institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).




	        The
	aggregate proceeds to the Selling Stockholders from the sale of our Class A common stock offered by them will be the purchase price of our Class A common stock less
	discounts or commissions, if any. The Selling Stockholders reserve the right to accept and, together with their agents from time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of our
	Class A common stock to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from any offering by the Selling Stockholders.




	        The
	Selling Stockholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the
	Securities Act, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule, or pursuant to other available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.




	        The
	Selling Stockholders and any underwriters, broker-dealers or agents that participate in the sale of our Class A common stock or interests therein may be "underwriters" within
	the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act. Any discounts, commissions, concessions or profit they earn on any resale of the shares of our Class A common stock may be
	underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. If any Selling Stockholder is an "underwriter" within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, then the Selling
	Stockholder will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. Underwriters and their controlling persons, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into
	with us and the Selling Stockholders, to indemnification against and contribution toward specific civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.




	        To
	the extent required, the shares of our Class A common stock to be sold, the respective purchase prices and public offering prices, the names of any agents, dealer or
	underwriter, and any applicable discounts, commissions, concessions or other compensation with respect to a particular offer will be set forth in an accompanying prospectus supplement or, if
	appropriate, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement that includes this prospectus.




	        To
	facilitate the offering of the shares of our Class A common stock offered by the Selling Stockholders, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions
	that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our Class A common stock. This may include over-allotments or short sales, which involve the sale by persons participating in the
	offering of more shares than were sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their
	over-allotment option, if any. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of our Class A common stock by bidding for or purchasing shares in the open market or by imposing
	penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if shares sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The
	effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of our Class A common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These
	transactions may be discontinued at any time.




	        Selling Stockholders may use this prospectus in connection with resales of the Class A common stock. The applicable prospectus supplement will identify the Selling Stockholders,
	the terms of the Class A common stock and any material relationships between us and the Selling Stockholders. Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be underwriters under the Securities Act in
	connection with the Class A common stock they resell and any profits on the sales may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Unless otherwise set forth
	in a prospectus supplement, the Selling Stockholders will receive all the net proceeds from the resale of the Class A common stock.

	Estimated
	expenses are not presently known. The foregoing sets forth the general categories of expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions)
	that we anticipate we will incur in connection with the offering of securities under this registration statement on Form S-3. An estimate of the aggregate expenses in connection with the
	issuance and distribution of the securities being offered will be included in the applicable prospectus supplement.













	Item 15.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers






	        The Registrant is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL allows a corporation to
	provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of the corporation will not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as
	a director, except where the director breached the duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or
	approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law or obtained an improper personal benefit. The Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation provides for this limitation of liability.




	        Section 145
	of the DGCL ("Section 145") provides that a Delaware corporation may indemnify any person who was, is or is threatened to be made party to any threatened,
	pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of such corporation), by reason of the fact that such
	person is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of such corporation or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
	enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
	action, suit or proceeding, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the corporation's best interests and, with respect to any
	criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was illegal. A Delaware corporation may indemnify any persons who are, were or are threatened to be made a
	party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of another
	corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses
	(including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, provided such person acted in good faith and in a
	manner




	II-1











	Table of Contents





	he
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the corporation's best interests, provided that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval if the officer, director, employee or agent
	is adjudged to be liable to the corporation. Where an officer or director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, the corporation must indemnify him
	against the expenses which such officer or director has actually and reasonably incurred.




	        Section 145
	further authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or
	is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
	any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would otherwise have the power to indemnify him under Section 145.




	        The
	Registrant's Bylaws provide that the Registrant must indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL and must also pay expenses incurred in
	defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, that if and to the extent required by the DGCL, the advancement of expenses shall only be made upon delivery of an
	undertaking, by or on behalf of an indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified.




	        The
	indemnification rights set forth above shall not be exclusive of any other right which an indemnified person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
	Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.




	        The
	Registrant maintains standard policies of insurance that provide coverage (1) to its directors and officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of duty
	or other wrongful act and (2) to the Registrant with respect to indemnification payments that it may make to such directors and officers as required by its organizational documents or
	indemnification agreements between the Registrant and its directors and officers.











	Item 16.    Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules






	        (a)   Exhibits.




	        The
	exhibit index attached hereto is incorporated herein by reference.











	Item 17.    Undertakings






	        (a)   The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:





	        (1)   To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:





	          (i)  To
	include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;




	         (ii)  To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof)
	which individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement.





	Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation
	from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in





	II-2











	Table of Contents






	volume
	and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective Registration Statement; and





	        (iii)  To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such
	information in the Registration Statement;






	provided, however



	, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the information required to be included
	in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
	that are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.




	        (2)   That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering
	thereof.




	        (3)   To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.




	        (4)   That,
	for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser:





	        (A)  Each
	prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus
	was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and




	        (B)  Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to
	an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act shall be deemed to
	be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier
	of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in
	Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating
	to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona
	fide



	offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document
	incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior
	to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately
	prior to such effective date; and





	        (5)   That,
	for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned
	registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities
	to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications,





	II-3











	Table of Contents






	the
	undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:





	          (i)  Any
	preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	         (ii)  Any
	free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;




	        (iii)  The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided
	by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	        (iv)  Any
	other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.






	        (b)   The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant's annual report
	pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating
	to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	        Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing
	provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
	unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered,
	the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	March 4, 2016




	Ladder Capital Corp

	345 Park Avenue, 8th Floor

	New York, New York 10154




	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	        We are acting as special counsel to Ladder Capital Corp, a Delaware corporation (the "



	Company



	"), in connection with the preparation of the
	Registration Statement on Form S-3 (as amended or supplemented, the "



	Registration Statement



	") originally filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the "



	Commission



	") on March 6, 2015 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "



	Securities
	Act



	"), by the Company. The Registration Statement relates to the offer and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated
	under the Securities Act, of 80,959,036 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "



	Shares



	") to be sold by
	certain stockholders of the Company (the "



	Selling Stockholders



	").




	        In connection with the registration of the Shares, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and
	other instruments as
	we have deemed necessary for the purposes of this opinion, including (i) the organizational documents of the Company, (ii) minutes and records of the corporate proceedings of the Company
	and (iii) the Registration Statement and the exhibits thereto.




	        For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies
	and the authenticity of the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of the signatures of persons signing
	all documents in connection with which this opinion is rendered, the authority of such persons signing on behalf of the parties thereto other than the Company and the due authorization, execution and
	delivery of all documents by the parties thereto other than the Company. We have not independently established or verified any facts relevant to the opinions expressed herein, but have relied upon
	statements and representations of the officers and other representatives of the Company.




	        We have also assumed that:





	          (i)  the
	Registration Statement will be effective and will comply with all applicable laws at the time the Shares are offered as contemplated by the Registration Statement;




	         (ii)  a prospectus supplement or term sheet ("



	Prospectus Supplement



	") will have been prepared and filed with the Commission
	describing the Shares offered thereby and will comply with all applicable laws;




	        (iii)  all Shares will be sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the appropriate
	Prospectus Supplement;








	   





Click to enlarge










	        (iv)  a
	definitive purchase, underwriting, or similar agreement, if applicable, with respect to any Shares offered will have been duly authorized and validly executed and
	delivered by the Company and the other parties thereto; and




	         (v)  the Shares will be issued and sold in the form and containing the terms set forth in the Registration Statement and the appropriate Prospectus Supplement.





	        Based
	upon and subject to the foregoing qualifications, assumptions and limitations and the further limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that, with respect to the Shares to
	be offered by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the Registration Statement, such Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.




	        Our opinion expressed above is subject to the qualifications that we express no opinion as to the applicability of, compliance with, or effect of any laws except the laws of the State of
	New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including the applicable provisions of the Delaware constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws.




	        We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the reference to our firm under the heading
	"Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities
	Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.




	        We do not find it necessary for the purposes of this opinion, and accordingly we do not purport to cover herein, the application of the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of the various
	states to the sale of the Shares.




	        This opinion is limited to the specific issues addressed herein, and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond that expressly stated herein. The Shares may be sold from time to time
	on a delayed or continuous basis, and this opinion is limited to the laws, including the rules and regulations, as in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible
	retroactive effect. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion should the present federal securities laws of the United States, laws of the State of New York or the General
	Corporation Law of the State of Delaware be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.




	        This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise relied upon for any other purpose.






















	 




	 




	Sincerely,

	Ladder
	Capital Corp

	345 Park Avenue8th Floor

	New York, NY 10154




	        Re:    



	Certain United States Federal Income Tax Matters





	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:




	        You
	have requested our opinion concerning certain U.S. federal income tax considerations in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended, of Ladder
	Capital Corp, a Delaware corporation ("



	Ladder



	"), originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
	"



	Commission



	") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on March 6, 2015 (such Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, the
	"



	Registration Statement



	"). The Registration Statement relates to the issuance and sale, from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 of the General
	Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Act, of 80,959, 036 shares of Class A common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Ladder by the selling stockholders identified in the Registration
	Statement and such additional selling stockholders as may be named in one or more prospectus supplements.




	        We
	have acted as tax counsel to Ladder in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and certain other documents.




	        In
	connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement and such other documentation
	and information provided to us by you as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In addition, you have provided us with, and we are relying upon, a
	certificate containing certain factual statements, factual representations and covenants of officers of Ladder (the "



	Officers' Certificate



	") relating
	to, among other things, the actual and proposed operations of Ladder and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or indirect interest (collectively, the
	"



	Company



	"). For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the facts, statements, representations and covenants set forth in the
	Officers' Certificate, the Registration Statement, or in any other document. In particular, we note that the Company may engage in transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal
	advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. Consequently, we have relied on your representation that the facts, statements, representations, and covenants presented in the Officers'
	Certificate, the Registration










	Statement,
	and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describe all material facts with respect to the matters addressed in the Officers' Certificate. We have assumed
	that all such facts, statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any qualification as to knowledge, belief, intent, materiality or otherwise. Our opinion is conditioned on the
	continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts, statements, representations and covenants. We are not aware of any facts inconsistent with the statements in the Officers' Certificate. Any material
	change or inaccuracy in the facts, statements, representations, and covenants referred to, set forth, or assumed herein or in the Officers' Certificate may affect our conclusions set forth herein.




	        In
	our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the
	authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, or electronic copies, and the
	authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from
	such drafts.




	        Our
	opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i) Ladder and each of the entities comprising the Company has been and will continue to be operated in
	accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which each was formed and in the manner described in the relevant organizational documents, (ii) there will be no changes in the applicable laws
	of the State of Delaware or of any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been formed, and (iii) each of the written agreements to which the
	Company is a party has been and will be implemented, construed and enforced in accordance with its terms.




	        In
	rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "



	Code



	"), the regulations
	promulgated thereunder ("



	Regulations



	"), administrative rulings and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the
	Internal Revenue Service ("



	IRS



	"), all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and
	administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases
	for our opinion could affect our conclusions set forth herein. There can be no assurance, moreover, that our opinion will be accepted by the IRS or, if challenged, by a court.




	        Based
	on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, commencing with Ladder's taxable year ending on December 31, 2015, Ladder has been organized and operated in
	conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a "



	REIT



	") under the Code, and its actual method of
	operation through the date hereof has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As noted in the
	Registration Statement, Ladder's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual operating results, certain requirements relating to the sources of its income, the
	nature of its assets, its distribution levels and the diversity of its stock ownership, and various other qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us.
	Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of Ladder's operations for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.




	        This
	opinion is furnished to you in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. This opinion may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent. We
	consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the headings "U.S. Federal Income
	Tax Considerations," and "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under
	Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission.




	2










	        Except
	as set forth above, we express no other opinion. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any
	legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied
	upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.




























	 




	Very truly yours,












	 







	/s/ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
