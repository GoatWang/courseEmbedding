CMS processes over one billion claims each year and contracts with approximately one million providers. Prior to serving the Bush Administration, she practiced law in the Washington, D.C., office of Epstein Becker Green, where she advised clients on a variety of health policy matters. She also served in the first Bush administration in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel and the Office of the U.S.Trade Representative.

Words such as "believe," "demonstrate," "expect," "estimate," "forecast," "anticipate," "should" and "likely" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that are not historical should also be considered forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.

These factors include, but are not limited to, our continuing relationship with government entities and our ability to procure business from them, our ability to manage growing and changing operations, the implementation of the healthcare reform law, state budget changes and legislation, statements with respect to Providence's expected use of net proceeds from the transaction and other risks detailed in Providence's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and subsequent filings.  Providence is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update any of the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
