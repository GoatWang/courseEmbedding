ABOUT USPROGRAMSPARTNERSPRESSRESOURCES

WHY WINE ON TAP?


At Free Flow Wines, we believe that a wine should taste exactly as the winemaker intended. Besides maintaining superior wine quality, wine on tap in stainless steel kegs reduces the cost of traditional bottle packaging and transportation. By eliminating this packaging (bottles, corks, capsules, labels and cases), there is a lot less to ship and recycle, lowering the carbon footprint of the wine and hospitality industries.
Saving the world…one keg at a time.

The Life of a Keg



What others say about us





“We started working with Free Flow…and kegs have gone from being one of our constant headaches to a channel whose contribution might be as positive for our bottom line as it is for the wine we sell through that channel.”
Jason HaasPartner & General Manager, Tablas Creek Vineyard
“No matter whether you are 2,000 cases or 200,000, Free Flow makes wine on tap easy, with great pricing and support.  When it comes to wine on tap – there is no one better!”
Richard WardOwner, Saintsbury Winery
“Free Flow Wines’ consistent attention to quality control is among the best I have seen.”
Judy MilesMicrobiologist / Quality Systems, Treasury Wine Estates
“For years we were concerned about quality control. Once we learned that the quality of the wine could be maintained….that’s when we found Free Flow.”
Kathy HallVintner, HALL Winery
“By making a move to grow our kegging business, I am taking a page out of my grandfather’s book and taking risks when it comes to new and exciting ways of bringing wine to today’s consumers.”
Donny SebastianiPresident and CEO, Don & Sons
“Wine on tap…it’s delicious, easy and exactly how the winemaker intended you to drink it.”
John ColemanCEO & Executive Chef, Savor
“It’s a great avenue for providing your customer with the best possible product – while maximizing yield – which leads to great profit potentials and a happy customer.”
Mike KlostermanPerlick Manufacturer Rep & Regional Sales, Apex Commerical Kitchen Co.
“One of the pros (to kegging wine) is certainly the cost.  The cost differential is a result of the packaging associated with bottling—glass, corks, capsules, labels—all of which are not part of kegging.”
Juan Jose VerdinaWinemaker, Jamieson Ranch 
“The ability to produce six and a half cases of wine with no cardboard, no corks, no bottles and no labels means that the keg is paid for the first time you sell it.”
John HoulihanVP of Beverage and Hopsitality, Lark Creek Restaurant Group
“The dynamic of the wine changes the moment it’s bottled.  A keg is consistent all the way through.  My first glass and my 300th glass are identical.”
Mac Gregory Saint Marc Pub
“Unfortunately most wine bottles are colored glass, and recyclers want clear glass.  It breaks my heart that glass ends up in landfills, and then there’s the energy it takes to produce the bottles, corks, labels, the cardboard box the wine is shipped in…the beauty of wine in a keg is that it gets used over and over. And it’s a better product.”
Jack GibbonsPresident of Front Burner Restaurants
“We’ve never had any issues with wine quality.  Free Flow’s quality standards are good.  They understand winemaking.”
Bill BatchelorWinemaker, Martin Ray Winery
“Free Flow is the leader in making sure kegging is done right.”
Eric SothernNational Sales Director, the Bespoke Collection

FACILITY

State-of-the-art kegging and production facility
Vetted by the world’s most sophisticated quality control teams, our processes and procedures were developed entirely in-house, to ensure that premium wines get from the barrel to the tap, tasting just the winemaker intended.  Our fully automated kegging line cleans and fills kegs, ensuring that every keg is wine-ready.  Our facility is also home to a custom water reclamation system that cleans over 95% of our wastewater for reuse.  To improve our logistical footprint and offer additional services to wineries looking to fill on the east coast, Free Flow Wines will be opening an East Coast Filling Station that will go live in Q2.

CLEANING & FILLING
Certified by some of the wine industries leading companies, our cleaning Standard Operating Procedures are the best in the industry.   Our state-of-the-art automated keg filling machine can clean and fill up to 70 kegs per hour.  This machine washes the kegs inside and out, sanitizes each keg with caustic, citric, and steam, and then cools the kegs back down before being purged with Nitrogen & filled with wine.
Each of our kegs is

Rinsed with water
Cycled with hot caustic
Cycled with Citric
Sterilized with steam
Purged with Nitrogen

This process ensures total sterility of the inside of our kegs.
PACKAGING
Packaging kegs is different than bottles because each keg has to have an approved TTB collar applied to its neck prior to distributor fulfillment.  Free Flow ensures that every keg is certified by providing you with a keg collar template, COLA compliance filing, printing services, excise tax management as well as the application of the collars and tamper proof caps.  Once packaged, kegs are palletized and stored in a temperature controlled and reliable warehouse.

Free Flow Wines Announces TAP’D Draft Solutions, a New Draft Services Division that Expands the Company’s Services and Offers Innovative New Products On Tap



Share Article


















TAP’D Draft Solutions broadens Free Flow Wines’ service offering and is set to enable a number of new products on tap including beer, wine, spirits, and coffee







TAP'D Draft Solutions provides high-quality draft installation and line cleaning services.

Draft line cleaning and maintenance is the key to pouring kegged beverages the way the maker intended—whether it’s beer, wine, cider, spirits, coffee, water or anything else you can put into a keg,” said Jordan Kivelstadt.


Napa, CA (PRWEB)
January 26, 2015
 Free Flow Wines, the pioneer of premium wine on tap, announced today that the company has created a new division called TAP’D Draft Solutions. TAP’D Draft Solutions provides custom draft system design, installation, maintenance, and line cleaning. The company’s innovative draft products go beyond beer and wine to enable spirits, coffee and more on-tap. Free Flow Wines and TAP’D Draft Solutions will be exhibiting at the Unified Wine & Grape Symposium in Sacramento this week (Booth #2304).
“We knew that in order to help our winery and wholesaler customers we needed a full-service draft solution,” said Free Flow Wines’ Co-Founder and CEO, Jordan Kivelstadt. “TAP’D Draft Solutions has allowed us to expand our client services, while we keep our core wine on tap business focused on the delivery of premium wines on tap. The icing on the cake is that this acquisition and new division enables our clients to offer incredible new beverages on tap.”
Free Flow Wines acquired Bay Area-based Cuff’s Tap Service in July 2014 and has spent the past six months re-engineering it into TAP’D Draft Solutions. Kivelstadt now also serves as the CEO of TAP’D Draft Solutions, with founder John Cuff staying on as president. 
“Draft line cleaning and maintenance is the key to pouring kegged beverages the way the maker intended—whether it’s beer, wine, cider, spirits, coffee, water or anything else you can put into a keg,” added Kivelstadt. “John Cuff and his team have decades of experience installing and troubleshooting all types of draft systems and I am thrilled to have them drive this next stage in our business.” 
TAP’D Draft Solutions currently has 15 employees and will operate out of the Free Flow Wines headquarters in Napa, California. The company provides high-quality draft installation and line cleaning services and currently offers services in Northern California, with the goal of expanding beyond the Bay Area in the near future. 
“We have been the leading provider of beer and wine draft services in the Bay Area since 1999,” said Cuff. “As a part of Free Flow Wines, we now have the ability to develop incredibly innovative draft solutions and provide a broader offering to our customers.”
TAP’D Draft Solutions provides the following services:

  Draft system installation – Installation and troubleshooting for all types of draft systems, TAP’D will install the system with excellence and professionalism—whether it is for beer, wine, cider, spirits, coffee, water, or anything else that can be placed into a keg. 
  Draft equipment and repair - TAP’D Draft Solutions is a trusted partner with the country’s leading suppliers of draft parts and equipment. They stock various parts to get a system up and pouring and can address any issues that arise. 
  Maintenance program - TAP’D Draft Solutions offers a draft system maintenance program to help prevent draft system failure. They provide preventative maintenance on draft systems, including the power pack (glycol cooling unit), to keep the unit running.  
  Line maintenance and cleaning - Draft line cleaning and maintenance is the key to pouring kegged products the way the maker intended. TAP’D Draft Solutions works with over a dozen local distributors and a growing number of local craft brewers to clean draft lines. 
About TAP’D Draft Solutions
TAP’D Draft Solutions provides custom draft design, installation, maintenance, and line cleaning for draft systems. The company’s draft solutions enable innovative new products that go beyond beer and wine, to include on-tap cocktails, spirits, coffee, and more. Formerly Cuff’s Tap Service, the company has been the leading provider of beer and wine draft services in the Bay Area since 1999. Their team has decades of experience installing, maintaining and troubleshooting all types of draft systems. TAP’D Draft Solutions is a division of Free Flow Wines and can be found online at TapdDraft.com and on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @tapddraft.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.

Free Flow Wines, LLC Key Developments

Gotham Project and Free Flow Wines Launch Filling Station East Creating a Coast-to-Coast National Platform for Wine on Tap
Feb 1 17
The Gotham Project and Free Flow Wines announced the opening of their joint-venture, a co-operated facility, called Filling Station East.  Located in Bayonne, New Jersey, Filling Station East is dedicated to packaging premium imported wines in reusable steel kegs for the US wine on tap market.  This collaboration allows Gotham Project and Free Flow Wines to create a coast-to-coast national platform with a dedicated fleet of over 150,000 stainless steel kegs.  Used exclusively for wine, these kegs can now be transported efficiently across the country for Gotham Project and Free Flow Wines customers. By not having empty kegs returned long distances, both companies can reduce costs and the carbon footprint of their products. The new 12,000 square foot facility will also act as an east coast hub for wine on tap training, education and marketing. Both Gotham Project and Free Flow have spent the last seven years pioneering the wine on tap market, which is on track to exceed 300,000 kegs (650,000 9-liter cases) in 2017. Together, the two companies will individually, and collectively, continue to build the wine on tap category.
