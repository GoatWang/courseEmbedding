What our customers have to say...
What our customers have to say...


            123inkjets is probably the best place in american to order re-inked inkjet cartridges. i use them in all my epson printers and i am highly satisfied. the savings alone has allowed my to purchase the newer epson surecolor p800 and i hope 123inkjets will have cartridges for them soon!- Dr. M, 6/26/2017 

            I like the idea of getting the refill kits, which i hope will make life and productivity a affordable options- Office lg, 6/26/2017 

            I really like the sales at 123 inkjets as they have always pleased me.- CherylC, 6/26/2017 

            Have ordered ink from them many times and have never been disappointed.- Annie Orange, 6/17/2017 

            I really like 123inkjets! with every purchase, i am amazed at the value i get from them considering the price. and when i have needed to call to get information, whom ever i speak to, has always been so helpful and pleasant! oh and anyone i notice anywhere, that is looking for/at ink cartridge replacements, i spontaneously suggest they might consider looking into 123inkjets online for their replacements, not only because of the great quality and good customer service, but also the quickness of the cartridges being delivered. i live in the tehachapi mountains of california, so that makes for few choices to find replacements up here, thus the cost up here reflecting "bigger demand with few places to choose from" pricing! :-)- Terry, 6/17/2017 

            Easy to find what i need. entire process from search to check out in less than 5 minutes- Inky123, 6/14/2017 

            I appreciate having a convenient way of shopping for critical items which are delivered in a timely manner.- Thankful, 6/14/2017 

            I have used 123inkjets many times. i am always satisfied with the product and the service for my onlne orders. i will continue to use them in the future and have and will again recommend them to friends and associates.- DianaB59, 6/14/2017 

            Good ink, good service, good value. been using 123inkjets for years.- LARedhead, 6/13/2017 

            I have been using 123 injets for at least 6 years and i am very satified with the products and prices- Dbald8, 6/13/2017 

            It's the best to buy ink cartridges. it has such a large variety of cartridges to choose from and shipping arrives on time. plus it's got great prices. i've never been disappointed with their products and continue to use them when i need new cartridges, .- Trudy, 6/13/2017 

            My order was promptly delivered at a very reasonable price. thank you.- Hudg, 6/13/2017 

            In this day and age of non customer service, 123inkjets is a refreshing and renewed faith it still exists!!!! always helpful, always accommodating.- Happy customer, 6/12/2017 

            Ordering was painless!! order arrived before expectations. prices were/are very good. order was correct!!- "oleguy", 6/12/2017 

            I am pretty happy and satisfied with purchasing from 123 inkjets. it is so much more economical. the order was a back up for my current cartridge so i will use it when my current runs out which is soon.- Ronay, 6/11/2017 

            I was very pleased with the whole process and my order. i will order all my ink from you in the future.- Jim, 6/11/2017

Ensuring Product Safety


We manage quality following standards stricter than legal requirements to enable customers to use our products with complete peace of mind.
Voluntary Action Plan Based on the Basic Policy on Product Safety
Canon believes that one of its most important missions as a manufacturer is to provide safe products that offer peace of mind and satisfaction. With this in mind, we formulated a Basic Policy on Product Safety, which some group companies in Japan complies with.
				Moreover, we have formulated a Voluntary Action Plan for Product Safety based on this policy that we carry out in an effort to ensure product safety and focus on the customer.
				We also comply fully with government laws and notices, and have developed a system to report immediately in the case of an infraction, such as an accident involving one of our products.
				Additionally, Canon Inc. as well as Group companies in Japan* have formulated and are following a Voluntary Action Plan for Product Safety suited to their business field.


*Group companies with an established Voluntary Action Plan for Product Safety
						Canon Inc.; Canon Marketing Japan; Canon System & Support; Canon Electronics; Canon Finetech; Canon Machinery; Canon ANELVA; Canon Tokki; Oita Canon; Canon Chemicals; Nagahama Canon; Fukushima Canon; Canon Precision; Oita Canon Materials; Hita Canon Materials; Nagasaki Canon


Canon Inc. Activity Topics for 2015

Management review by the president based on the Voluntary Action Plan for Product Safety (continued from 2008)
Revised a total of nine company rules, including Product Safety Regulations and Chemical Safety Regulation Action Procedures
Revised a total of ten standards, including Injury Protection Safety Standard and Chemical Emission Safety Standards
Continued to raise awareness among customers about smoke emissions from counterfeit batteries and safe handling of electric cords and plugs, etc.
Continued to implement product safety education and emphasized the importance of product safety during basic training on quality
Continued with updated version of e-learning course for all employees to promote understanding of the Voluntary Action Plan for Product Safety



Product Safety Technical Standards
Canon regards the provision of safe products as one of the most fundamental and important missions of a manufacturer.
				We, therefore, require that all Canon products comply with our own Product Safety Technical Standards, which take into account customer perspectives on product use as well as legally stipulated product safety standards.
				For example, we employ plastics that are more flame resistant than the law requires, and we implement doubleprotection schemes for important safety-related components.
				Additionally, we continually revise these standards based on technological advancements and environmental changes. In 2015, we revised standards pertaining to plastics and fire spread prevention, taking into account such factors as the latest fire-resistance performance of plastic materials and structural designs that prevent the spread of fire.
				Based on these technical standards, we strictly enforce safety management at the design, evaluation and manufacturing stages. Items not meeting these exacting standards are withheld from the market to ensure that all products meet our requirements for substantial safety.*


*Substantial safety
						An approach to ensuring product safety that takes into account such factors as anticipated customer usage, going beyond what is prescribed in legal and regulatory frameworks


Canon's Main Approaches to Safety Technology

Attempt to assess injury, which hypothetically might occur in a variety of operations performed by customers, taking into perspective human factors for safety such as body function, ability, human psychology/behavior
Engage in joint development with manufacturers of essential safety-related components, such as noncombustible parts and non-fail protective components, and employ those meeting the requirements of Canon's Qualification System for parts and components
Conduct safety confirmation testing based on abnormal voltage waveforms in commercial power supplies confirmed in regions around the world where products are sold
Hypothesize abnormalities, such as component failure, and conduct stricter safety evaluation testing than is required by the laws of each country and region



Quality Assessment during Development
Establishing an Assessment Environment for Delivery of Products that are Safe and Offer Peace of Mind


At Canon Inc., we have set up testing facilities compliant with official standards and relevant laws to accurately and thoroughly assess the safety of products in terms of electromagnetic radiation (EMI), noise, flame resistance ratings, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), genotoxicity and electrical safety.
						Canon Inc. has also obtained certification in public standards such as ISO*1/IEC*2 and UL*3, enabling publicly certified testing to be carried out in-house according to highly precise measurements.
						Specifically, Canon Inc. is equipped with the industry's leading testing technology, including anechoic chambers for EMI testing that are among the largest and best in Japan, a verification laboratory for testing the fire safety and ignition propensity of large products, shielded rooms, and semi-anechoic chambers for acoustic noise. In addition to EMC testing*4, Canon Inc. is able to conduct all testing necessary to apply for Blue Angel certification*5 in-house.


*1ISO International Organization for Standardization
								A non-governmental organization established in Geneva, Switzerland in 1947 in order to formulate international standards. 
*2IEC International Electrotechnical Commission
								An international standardization group that formulates standards on electrical and digital technologies. Standardization pertaining to the fields of electrical and digital technologies is covered by the IEC and not ISO. The IEC is based in Geneva, Switzerland and it was established in 1906.
*3UL Underwriters Laboratories Inc.
								Established in the state of Illinois, USA, in 1894 for the independent testing and certification of the safety of products that pass its assessment tests based on its own product safety standards established to standardize function and safety.
*4EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing
This consists of testing for electromagnetic interference emitted by the product or its power sources that affects the operations of other equipment, as well as electromagnetic susceptibility testing, which tests the susceptibility of the product itself to malfunctioning caused by electromagnetic interference in the vicinity.
*5Blue Angel
								Blue Angel was launched in 1978 as the world's first eco-labeling system and is monitored by Germany's Federal Environmental Agency, the German Institute for Quality Assurance and Certification and the Environmental Label Jury, an independent decision-making body.

Concentrating Quality Management at the Tamagawa Office with its Industryleading Facilities

In November 2014, Canon completed construction of a new building at the Tamagawa Office, which it considers to be the central hub of its quality efforts. All qualityrelated supervisory functions, including evaluations, management, audits, and planning, have been consolidated at the Tamagawa Office as of March 2016.
							Our goal is to not only achieve synergy through this concentration, but also to effectively utilize measurement and assessment facilities, improve the accuracy of measurements and assessments, and shorten the lead time for providing feedback to requesting divisions. Going forward, we will continue to work to enhance our quality management from various perspectives.

Safety Assessment Initiatives
Safety Assessments of Chemical Substances Released from Products


Canon assesses the chemical emissions from its printers, multifunction devices, projectors and other products.
						Our assessments include measurements necessary for acquisition of Germany's Blue Angel environmental label, such as benzene, styrene, ozone and dust, as well as of VOCs for which exposure limits have been set within Japan or internationally. We verify that emission levels meet in-house standards, which are the same or even more stringent than those set worldwide.
						The in-house testing laboratory carrying out these assessments has been certified as a fair and impartial test facility for applications for the Blue Angel mark and has received ISO/IEC 17025 certification from the Japan Accreditation Board for Conformity Assessment, carrying out measurements in compliance with ISO/IEC 28360.
						The scope of certification as an ISO-certified test laboratory was expanded in response to additions to the Blue Angel (RAL-UZ 171) criteria calling for the measurement of ultrafine particles (UFPs).
						Blue Angel is also considering adding UFP standards for large equipment that until now have been excluded from the standards. Canon responds in a timely manner to the strengthening of standards.

Safety Assessments of Ink, Toner and Other Consumables


Canon assesses the safety and ensures the quality of its ink, toner and other consumables, enabling customers to use its printers and MFDs with confidence.
						For example, with regard to the materials for ink and toner, we carry out assessments related to genotoxicity, which is thought to be closely linked to carcinogenicity, using in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus tests. As of August 2014, Canon has been able to test in-house the distinctive water-insoluble materials used in many Canon products.
						Canon's testing laboratories are highly reliable and have been certified by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare as in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)* standards in the Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc. (Chemical Substances Control Law). Canon's laboratories also comply with GLP standards set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Furthermore, Canon became the first in Japan to have its in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test certified as in compliance with the GLP standards in the Chemical Substances Control Law.


*Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
								The standard for the management, testing and reporting of facilities and organizations that operate as testing agencies conducting chemical substance safety assessments. Testing according to GLP standards ensures reproducibility and data reliability. GLP standards set by the OECD were enacted in 1981, and since then, member countries have developed domestic laws and regulations based on these standards. Facilities certified as compliant under Japan's GLP standards in the Chemical Substances Control Law must have their certification renewed every three years, which involves receiving a new conformity screening prior to the expiration of the certification's validity period.

Using Animal Testing to Assess the Safety of Chemicals
Certain laws and regulations in Japan and other countries require the submission of animal testing data when assessing the safety of chemicals, and in some cases, animal testing is an effective means of verifying the impacts a chemical has on human health or the environment.
				Based on this background, Canon conducts animal testing through a third-party specialist institution only in cases where it cannot obtain existing data externally with regard to the chemicals used in its toners and inks and no other alternative is available.
				This policy is stipulated in our in-house rules on the safety of chemical products along with the Three Rs*, a basic international principle on animal testing.
				Canon will continue to gather information and conduct analysis on novel approaches and evaluation methods that do not require animal testing so that alternative forms of evaluations can be carried out.


*The Three Rs
						A worldwide set of principles on animal testing advocated in 1959.
						Reduction: Reduce the number of animals used in testing
						Refinement: Minimize the suffering of animals
						Replacement: Use alternative methods to animal testing


Qualification System for Electronic Parts to Ensure Safety and Reliability


Canon considers it essential to maintain and improve the quality and reliability of every component, including integrated circuits and various electronic parts, to ensure that products are safe and reliable. Consequently, we built and operate a qualification system of our own design for these electronic parts.
						When selecting parts under this system, we evaluate reliability and structural soundness in accordance with standards for each category, ultimately using only electronic parts that meet these standards of quality.
						In recent years, the market for electronic parts has undergone significant changes, including the consolidation of semiconductor manufacturers and plant relocations. Despite this upheaval, Canon has been able to maintain consistent quality levels by utilizing this qualification system.
						Canon is also working on enhancing its technologies to keep pace with advancements in electronic parts. This includes high-precision non-destructive evaluation technologies such as X-ray CT scans, and more detailed processing and observation technologies, as well as measurement technologies for higher-speed LSI.

Response to Software Vulnerability
In recent years, more and more of Canon's multifunction devices and cameras, among other products, are being connected to other products via a network, greatly enhancing convenience. At the same time, this increases information security risks, including the leakage of personal information or confidential information from products connected to these networks.
				In response to such risks, Canon conducts various vulnerability tests on software for network-compatible products during development, and strives to standardize companywide approaches to raising awareness about vulnerabilities and risks as well as to testing methods.
				Moreover, recognizing the importance of minimizing the impact on customers when a vulnerability is found after products have been shipped, we strive to share and release necessary information about any such issues in a timely manner. Accordingly, we have established a system to investigate market trends on vulnerability, including the products of other companies, and to quickly share information internally to prevent similar problems from occurring in our own products.
				In 2015, we introduced the Vulnerability Assessment Check-Sheet as a quality confirmation requirement at the time of production checks in order to prevent software vulnerabilities from past products from reoccurring. This parameter sheet is now used across the company for vulnerability verification processes.
				We have expanded network- and softwarevulnerability prevention efforts to Group companies, and are progressing with the establishment of an informationsharing network and the sharing of testing techniques.
Pursuing Beauty and Comfort
To provide higher-quality images and videos, Canon has formulated methods for quantitatively evaluating and measuring the beauty and comfort that people feel. We are using these methods to develop practical tools to consistently achieve uniform, high-quality color reproduction from input to output.
				Moreover, to make Canon products more comfortable to use, we have established evaluation and measurement methods to reduce physical stress placed on the consumer when using our products. As part of the assessment process, we carry out user tests under our in-house monitor program.
				In addition, we have researched the auditory impact on users of sounds from product operations and ambient noise, with the aim of creating the most pleasing sounds. We are also developing quiet products that generate minimal operating noise.

After-sales Support
Online Support Service
In order to facilitate troubleshooting, Canon provides worldwide customer-support services through its company website.
				Customers can access support information, including FAQs, product specifications and user manuals, and can download the latest software and drivers from our website. Support information and software that are common worldwide, as well as local content that has been added by marketing subsidiaries, are published through our company websites in their respective languages.
				Customer usage is continuously monitored and survey information analyzed, with feedback going to the departments that created the relevant content. We continuously update the content based on frequently searched keywords, making it easier for customers to find what they are looking for.
Enhancing After-Sales Service Worldwide


After-sales service is critical to enabling customers to enjoy long-term use of Canon products with confidence. We are therefore expanding our after-sales service network on a global scale in order to offer the same level of prompt, reliable support in every market worldwide.

Utilizing Feedback from Market Data Analysis in Product Improvements


In order to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction, Canon incorporates user feedback in addition to conducting product evaluations from the customer's perspective at the development stage.
						One method by which we do this is the use of the Call Information Collection and Analysis System, updated in 2015. This is a system to collect customer feedback and requests received by call centers at our marketing subsidiaries worldwide. Divisions such as development, production or marketing subsidiaries can view this information at any time, helping them to improve quality, revise user manuals and develop better products.
						While this system currently covers 27 countries and regions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Japan we plan to expand it further still.


Call Information Collection and Analysis System



Responding to Product Safety and Quality Issues
Although Canon strives to prevent product safety and quality issues, in the event that a safety or quality problem does arise, we have in place a framework that ensures a prompt and appropriate response, including causal investigation, free repairs and information disclosure.
				We keep our customers informed about product safety as well as quality issues and remedial procedures by placing product advisory statements in various newspapers and on our website. In 2015, no product advisory statements were placed on our website.
				In addition, we established a new page for posting quality notices in order to provide information in an easier to understand manner. Two notices were posted in 2015.			
Process for Responding to Quality Issues
When quality issues arise, the marketing subsidiaries in each country, which serve as the contact point for the customer, file a report with the quality assurance division of the respective Canon Inc. products operations. The quality assurance division then analyzes the cause of the issue and looks into countermeasures. Moreover, in the event of a major issue, related products operations, as well as the Quality Management Headquarters, legal division and public relations division are consulted concerning response measures, and a report is made to the chairman/president.
			When notification is made to customers via a company notice or the website, we provide instructions to each marketing subsidiary in the regions where the product is sold, and as a general rule release the information worldwide at the same time.

You would need to download the images to your local device running the hdAlbum EZ App in order to use images from social media or photo storage services.

Do I have to complete my project all in one sitting?
It is not necessary to complete your project in one sitting. The hdAlbum EZ App allows you to save and access your project at a later time. Just go to the Menu tab and select “My Albums”.

Can I change the layout by myself after the auto layout?
You have the option to manually change the auto selected photos and move text boxes. The layout design of the images is fixed.

How do I add more pages or photos?
You will need to start the project over if you would like to add more pages or photos. At the beginning of album creation, pages can only be selected in increments of 10 with each product ranging from 20 to 40 pages.

Can I customize my own background?
Your background color options are displayed on the design screen at the beginning of album creation. The background color can be changed in the editing screen to other color options available for that design. And you can customize image backgrounds if it's included in your layout.

Can I move the text to certain area of the page? What kind of fonts can I use?
Yes, you can move the text to the location of your choice. The hdAlbum EZ App allows you to use all the fonts stored on your device except for fonts not containing Latin characters. Specific fonts can be selected or changed in the "Album Settings" tab under "Font Type".

How do I use the "Layout Settings" features?
The "Layout Settings" tab allows you to select main characters for your photo book under the "Main People Setting" section. You can also select the number of photos to use in an album from less to more (no specific number of photos can be identified).

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

Projectors[edit]
Canon produces a wide range of award-winning projectors.[33]
Virtual Reality Headset[edit]
Canon is developing a prototype virtual reality headset (Canon VR). The headset offers a wider viewing angle (120 degrees) than other VR devices but requires handles rather than a head strap. The headset is not yet available on the market.[34]
Operations[edit]
Canon's world headquarters are located at 30-2 Shimomaruko 3-chome, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan. Canon has regional headquarters in America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan, Asia and Oceania (including Australia & New Zealand). Canon Europe has two principal subsidiaries: Canon Europa NV (based in Amstelveen, Netherlands) and Canon Europe Ltd. (based in Uxbridge, UK).
Canon is organised into three principal business segments: the Office Business Unit (the products of which include copying machines, digital production printers, large format inkjet printers, laser printers and multi-function devices); the Consumer Business Unit (the products of which include broadcasting equipment, calculators, compact digital cameras, digital SLR cameras, digital video camcorders, image scanners, interchangeable lenses, inkjet multifunction printers and single function inkjet printers); and the Industry and Others Business Unit (the products of which include computers, handy terminals, LCD lithography equipment, magnetic heads, medical imaging equipment, micromotors, ophthalmic equipment and semiconductor lithography equipment).[35]
On 26 December 2003, Canon Inc. announced restructuring plans for three domestic Canon Group companies. The restructuring involved the merger of two companies and the spinning off of 1.[36]
Canon generated total revenues of US$45,608 million in 2011, of which 53.9% was by the Office Business Unit, 36.9% by the Consumer Business Unit and 11.8% by the Industry and Others Business Unit.[35][note 1] In the same year, 31.3% of revenues were generated in Europe, 27.0% in the Americas, 22.2% in Asia and Oceania (ex. Japan) and 19.5% in Japan.[35]
Canon invested a total of US$3,946 million in research and development in 2011, equivalent to 8.7% of sales.[35] In 2011, Canon was granted 2,813 patents in the United States, the third-highest number of any company (after IBM and Samsung Electronics).[35]

Environmental record[edit]
A report by the environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet puts Canon at the top of a list of 56 companies the survey conducted on climate-friendly companies.[37]




AE-1 Film Camera. AE stood for Automatic Exposure.


Canon has also launched three new calculators in Europe, called "Green Calculators", which are produced in part from recycled Canon copiers.[38]
The company has a corporate social responsibility strategy in Europe named ‘Green is just a shade of blue’. The strategy places emphasis on green issues being ‘a small part of the bigger, bluer picture’, and therefore gives equal importance to other areas, including ethics, attitudes, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, education, science and social welfare.
The Canon Group has an environmental charter which looks at ‘offering products with a lower environmental burden through improvements in resource efficiency, while eliminating anti-social activities that threaten the health and safety of mankind and the environment.’[39]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2008 Canon donated financial support to help the estimated 5 million people displaced by the earthquake that hit China’s Sichuan province in May 2008.[40]
1 million RMB was donated to the Red Cross Society of China shortly after the earthquake. Canon Inc, Japan, soon followed with a donation of 10 million RMB.[40]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 1983 came the first title sponsors of the English football league The Football League, which was named The Canon League from 1983 to 1986, when the sponsorship was taken over by the Today newspaper. From 1967-2003 Canon sponsored the Greater Hartford Open [Now Travelers Championship].
Between 1985 and 1993, Canon sponsored Williams in Formula One while they won World Drivers Championships for Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Alain Prost (1993) and Four World Constructors Championships (1986,1987,1992,1993).
Since 2006 Canon has been helping the Red Cross provide support to thirteen Red Cross National Societies across Europe, with focus on youth projects. Support from Canon includes financial contributions and donations of imaging equipment; including cameras, copying machines and digital radiography devices, as well as volunteer activities.[41]
Canon Europe has been a partner of World Press Photo for sixteen years. World Press Photo promotes the professional standards in photography; organises the largest international contest for professional photojournalists and acts as a worldwide platform for press photography.[42]
Canon Asia sponsored many competitions such as Canon Photomarathon and reality TV show Photo Face-Off. The latter is a reality TV show in which professional photographer Justin Mott is the judge and competes against amateur photographers. Justin started filming season 3 in April 2016 and that season aired at the end of that same year.[43]

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

The company has a corporate social responsibility strategy in Europe named ‘Green is just a shade of blue’.

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

2010 to present[edit]
In 2010 Canon acquired Tereck Office Solutions, Inc.[16]
On 16 March 2010, Canon announced that it was seeking to acquire a new .canon generic top-level domain, acquiring it in February 2015 and using it for the first time on its global website in May 2016.[17][18]

Main articles: Canon PowerShot, Canon PowerShot G, Canon Digital IXUS, Canon EOS, Canon EF lens mount, Canon EF-S lens mount, and Canon EF-M lens mount
Canon has been manufacturing and distributing digital cameras since 1984, starting with the RC-701. The RC series was followed by the PowerShot and Digital IXUS series of digital cameras. Canon also developed the EOS series of digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) which includes high-end professional models.

Digital copiers[edit]
Canon's largest division in terms of revenue is its multifunction copier division. Canon distributes its consumer and home office imageCLASS line though retail outlets and professional grade imageRUNNER series through subsidiary Canon Solutions America and independent distributors. The professional grade series ranges from small table tops to large digital presses.
Printers[edit]
For many years, Canon was the principal maker of the print engines found in industry-standard laser printers.

Computers[edit]
Canon introduced two MSX home computer models in 1983, the V-10 and the V-20. Both offered just the minimum range of the MSX standards without any additional features. The V-20 was able to receive shooting data from the T90 Canon camera with the Data Memory Back T90 expansion.

Projectors[edit]
Canon produces a wide range of award-winning projectors.[33]
Virtual Reality Headset[edit]
Canon is developing a prototype virtual reality headset (Canon VR). The headset offers a wider viewing angle (120 degrees) than other VR devices but requires handles rather than a head strap. The headset is not yet available on the market.[34]
Operations[edit]
Canon's world headquarters are located at 30-2 Shimomaruko 3-chome, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan. Canon has regional headquarters in America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan, Asia and Oceania (including Australia & New Zealand). Canon Europe has two principal subsidiaries: Canon Europa NV (based in Amstelveen, Netherlands) and Canon Europe Ltd. (based in Uxbridge, UK).
Canon is organised into three principal business segments: the Office Business Unit (the products of which include copying machines, digital production printers, large format inkjet printers, laser printers and multi-function devices); the Consumer Business Unit (the products of which include broadcasting equipment, calculators, compact digital cameras, digital SLR cameras, digital video camcorders, image scanners, interchangeable lenses, inkjet multifunction printers and single function inkjet printers); and the Industry and Others Business Unit (the products of which include computers, handy terminals, LCD lithography equipment, magnetic heads, medical imaging equipment, micromotors, ophthalmic equipment and semiconductor lithography equipment).[35]
On 26 December 2003, Canon Inc. announced restructuring plans for three domestic Canon Group companies. The restructuring involved the merger of two companies and the spinning off of 1.[36]
Canon generated total revenues of US$45,608 million in 2011, of which 53.9% was by the Office Business Unit, 36.9% by the Consumer Business Unit and 11.8% by the Industry and Others Business Unit.[35][note 1] In the same year, 31.3% of revenues were generated in Europe, 27.0% in the Americas, 22.2% in Asia and Oceania (ex. Japan) and 19.5% in Japan.[35]
Canon invested a total of US$3,946 million in research and development in 2011, equivalent to 8.7% of sales.[35] In 2011, Canon was granted 2,813 patents in the United States, the third-highest number of any company (after IBM and Samsung Electronics).[35]

Environmental record[edit]
A report by the environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet puts Canon at the top of a list of 56 companies the survey conducted on climate-friendly companies.[37]




AE-1 Film Camera. AE stood for Automatic Exposure.


Canon has also launched three new calculators in Europe, called "Green Calculators", which are produced in part from recycled Canon copiers.[38]
The company has a corporate social responsibility strategy in Europe named ‘Green is just a shade of blue’. The strategy places emphasis on green issues being ‘a small part of the bigger, bluer picture’, and therefore gives equal importance to other areas, including ethics, attitudes, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, education, science and social welfare.
The Canon Group has an environmental charter which looks at ‘offering products with a lower environmental burden through improvements in resource efficiency, while eliminating anti-social activities that threaten the health and safety of mankind and the environment.’[39]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2008 Canon donated financial support to help the estimated 5 million people displaced by the earthquake that hit China’s Sichuan province in May 2008.[40]
1 million RMB was donated to the Red Cross Society of China shortly after the earthquake. Canon Inc, Japan, soon followed with a donation of 10 million RMB.[40]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 1983 came the first title sponsors of the English football league The Football League, which was named The Canon League from 1983 to 1986, when the sponsorship was taken over by the Today newspaper. From 1967-2003 Canon sponsored the Greater Hartford Open [Now Travelers Championship].
Between 1985 and 1993, Canon sponsored Williams in Formula One while they won World Drivers Championships for Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Alain Prost (1993) and Four World Constructors Championships (1986,1987,1992,1993).
Since 2006 Canon has been helping the Red Cross provide support to thirteen Red Cross National Societies across Europe, with focus on youth projects. Support from Canon includes financial contributions and donations of imaging equipment; including cameras, copying machines and digital radiography devices, as well as volunteer activities.[41]
Canon Europe has been a partner of World Press Photo for sixteen years. World Press Photo promotes the professional standards in photography; organises the largest international contest for professional photojournalists and acts as a worldwide platform for press photography.[42]
Canon Asia sponsored many competitions such as Canon Photomarathon and reality TV show Photo Face-Off. The latter is a reality TV show in which professional photographer Justin Mott is the judge and competes against amateur photographers. Justin started filming season 3 in April 2016 and that season aired at the end of that same year.[43]

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

The company has a corporate social responsibility strategy in Europe named ‘Green is just a shade of blue’.

Name[edit]
The company was originally named Seikikōgaku kenkyūsho (jpn. 精機光学研究所, Precision Optical Industry Co. Ltd.). In 1934 it produced the Kwanon, a prototype for Japan’s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal plane based shutter.[5] In 1947 the company name was changed to Canon Camera Co., Inc.,[5] shortened to Canon Inc. in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva Guan Yin (観音, Kannon in Japanese), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.
History[edit]
1937 to 1970[edit]
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1937 by Takeshi Mitarai, Goro Yoshida, Saburo Uchida and Takeo Maeda. During its early years the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated Nikkor lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).[6]
Between 1933 and 1936 ‘The Kwanon’, a copy of the Leica design, Japan’s first 35 mm focal plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form.[7] In 1940 Canon developed Japan's first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958 and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8, the world’s first movie camera with a zoom lens, and the Canonflex.
In 1961 Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the 'Canola 130', the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.

1970 to 2009[edit]
In 1971 Canon introduced the F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976 Canon launched the AE-1, the world’s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.[citation needed]
In 1982 "Wildlife as Canon Sees It" print ads first appeared in National Geographic magazine. Canon introduced the world’s first Inkjet printer using bubble jet technology in 1985. Canon introduced Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS) in 1987, named after the goddess of the dawn. EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera is introduced. Also in 1987 the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988 Canon introduced 'Kyosei philosophy'.[8] The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989.[9] In the same year the EOS RT, the world's first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.
In 1992 Canon launched the EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera.[10] In 1995 Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. EOS-1N RS, the world's fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS has a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996 Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.
In 2004 Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector.[11] Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.[12]
In November 2009 Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ.[13] Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010,[14] and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.[15]

In 2010 Canon acquired Tereck Office Solutions, Inc.[16]

Canon also developed the EOS series of digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) which includes high-end professional models.
Related to the consumer trend of switching compact cameras to smartphones, in Q1 2013 Canon Inc. operating profit fell 34 percent year-on-year.[32]

Digital copiers[edit]
Canon's largest division in terms of revenue is its multifunction copier division. Canon distributes its consumer and home office imageCLASS line though retail outlets and professional grade imageRUNNER series through subsidiary Canon Solutions America and independent distributors. The professional grade series ranges from small table tops to large digital presses.
Printers[edit]
For many years, Canon was the principal maker of the print engines found in industry-standard laser printers. The first models of Apple LaserWriter and the equivalent products made by HP used the Canon LBP-CX engine. The next models (LaserWriter II series, LaserJet II series) used the Canon LBP-SX engine. Later models used the Canon LBP-LX, LBP-EX, LBP-PX engines and many other Canon print engines.
Current printers use the proprietary BJNP protocol (USB over IP port 8611).

Canon manufactures a wide range of flatbed scanners, film scanners and document scanners for home and business use, including the Canon Canoscan 8800F.

Computers[edit]
Canon introduced two MSX home computer models in 1983, the V-10 and the V-20. Both offered just the minimum range of the MSX standards without any additional features. The V-20 was able to receive shooting data from the T90 Canon camera with the Data Memory Back T90 expansion.
Canon also sold a Canon AS400 PC 640x480 color display computer based on 8086 processor using CPM or MSDOS. Options included a 5mb Hard Drive. (shortly before release of the IBM PC).

Projectors[edit]
Canon produces a wide range of award-winning projectors.[33]
Virtual Reality Headset[edit]
Canon is developing a prototype virtual reality headset (Canon VR). The headset offers a wider viewing angle (120 degrees) than other VR devices but requires handles rather than a head strap. The headset is not yet available on the market.[34]
Operations[edit]
Canon's world headquarters are located at 30-2 Shimomaruko 3-chome, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan. Canon has regional headquarters in America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan, Asia and Oceania (including Australia & New Zealand). Canon Europe has two principal subsidiaries: Canon Europa NV (based in Amstelveen, Netherlands) and Canon Europe Ltd. (based in Uxbridge, UK).
Canon is organised into three principal business segments: the Office Business Unit (the products of which include copying machines, digital production printers, large format inkjet printers, laser printers and multi-function devices); the Consumer Business Unit (the products of which include broadcasting equipment, calculators, compact digital cameras, digital SLR cameras, digital video camcorders, image scanners, interchangeable lenses, inkjet multifunction printers and single function inkjet printers); and the Industry and Others Business Unit (the products of which include computers, handy terminals, LCD lithography equipment, magnetic heads, medical imaging equipment, micromotors, ophthalmic equipment and semiconductor lithography equipment).[35]
On 26 December 2003, Canon Inc. announced restructuring plans for three domestic Canon Group companies. The restructuring involved the merger of two companies and the spinning off of 1.[36]
Canon generated total revenues of US$45,608 million in 2011, of which 53.9% was by the Office Business Unit, 36.9% by the Consumer Business Unit and 11.8% by the Industry and Others Business Unit.[35][note 1] In the same year, 31.3% of revenues were generated in Europe, 27.0% in the Americas, 22.2% in Asia and Oceania (ex. Japan) and 19.5% in Japan.[35]
Canon invested a total of US$3,946 million in research and development in 2011, equivalent to 8.7% of sales.[35] In 2011, Canon was granted 2,813 patents in the United States, the third-highest number of any company (after IBM and Samsung Electronics).[35]

Environmental record[edit]
A report by the environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet puts Canon at the top of a list of 56 companies the survey conducted on climate-friendly companies.[37]




AE-1 Film Camera. AE stood for Automatic Exposure.


Canon has also launched three new calculators in Europe, called "Green Calculators", which are produced in part from recycled Canon copiers.[38]
The company has a corporate social responsibility strategy in Europe named ‘Green is just a shade of blue’. The strategy places emphasis on green issues being ‘a small part of the bigger, bluer picture’, and therefore gives equal importance to other areas, including ethics, attitudes, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, education, science and social welfare.
The Canon Group has an environmental charter which looks at ‘offering products with a lower environmental burden through improvements in resource efficiency, while eliminating anti-social activities that threaten the health and safety of mankind and the environment.’[39]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2008 Canon donated financial support to help the estimated 5 million people displaced by the earthquake that hit China’s Sichuan province in May 2008.[40]
1 million RMB was donated to the Red Cross Society of China shortly after the earthquake. Canon Inc, Japan, soon followed with a donation of 10 million RMB.[40]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 1983 came the first title sponsors of the English football league The Football League, which was named The Canon League from 1983 to 1986, when the sponsorship was taken over by the Today newspaper. From 1967-2003 Canon sponsored the Greater Hartford Open [Now Travelers Championship].
Between 1985 and 1993, Canon sponsored Williams in Formula One while they won World Drivers Championships for Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Alain Prost (1993) and Four World Constructors Championships (1986,1987,1992,1993).
Since 2006 Canon has been helping the Red Cross provide support to thirteen Red Cross National Societies across Europe, with focus on youth projects. Support from Canon includes financial contributions and donations of imaging equipment; including cameras, copying machines and digital radiography devices, as well as volunteer activities.[41]
Canon Europe has been a partner of World Press Photo for sixteen years. World Press Photo promotes the professional standards in photography; organises the largest international contest for professional photojournalists and acts as a worldwide platform for press photography.[42]
Canon Asia sponsored many competitions such as Canon Photomarathon and reality TV show Photo Face-Off. The latter is a reality TV show in which professional photographer Justin Mott is the judge and competes against amateur photographers. Justin started filming season 3 in April 2016 and that season aired at the end of that same year.[43]

What our customers have to say...
What our customers have to say...


            123inkjets is probably the best place in american to order re-inked inkjet cartridges. i use them in all my epson printers and i am highly satisfied. the savings alone has allowed my to purchase the newer epson surecolor p800 and i hope 123inkjets will have cartridges for them soon!- Dr. M, 6/26/2017 

            I like the idea of getting the refill kits, which i hope will make life and productivity a affordable options- Office lg, 6/26/2017 

            I really like the sales at 123 inkjets as they have always pleased me.- CherylC, 6/26/2017 

            Have ordered ink from them many times and have never been disappointed.- Annie Orange, 6/17/2017 

            I really like 123inkjets! with every purchase, i am amazed at the value i get from them considering the price. and when i have needed to call to get information, whom ever i speak to, has always been so helpful and pleasant! oh and anyone i notice anywhere, that is looking for/at ink cartridge replacements, i spontaneously suggest they might consider looking into 123inkjets online for their replacements, not only because of the great quality and good customer service, but also the quickness of the cartridges being delivered. i live in the tehachapi mountains of california, so that makes for few choices to find replacements up here, thus the cost up here reflecting "bigger demand with few places to choose from" pricing! :-)- Terry, 6/17/2017 

            Easy to find what i need. entire process from search to check out in less than 5 minutes- Inky123, 6/14/2017 

            I appreciate having a convenient way of shopping for critical items which are delivered in a timely manner.- Thankful, 6/14/2017

            It's the best to buy ink cartridges. it has such a large variety of cartridges to choose from and shipping arrives on time. plus it's got great prices. i've never been disappointed with their products and continue to use them when i need new cartridges, .- Trudy, 6/13/2017

What our customers have to say...


            123inkjets is probably the best place in american to order re-inked inkjet cartridges. i use them in all my epson printers and i am highly satisfied. the savings alone has allowed my to purchase the newer epson surecolor p800 and i hope 123inkjets will have cartridges for them soon!- Dr. M, 6/26/2017 

            I like the idea of getting the refill kits, which i hope will make life and productivity a affordable options- Office lg, 6/26/2017 

            I really like the sales at 123 inkjets as they have always pleased me.- CherylC, 6/26/2017 

            Have ordered ink from them many times and have never been disappointed.- Annie Orange, 6/17/2017 

            I really like 123inkjets! with every purchase, i am amazed at the value i get from them considering the price. and when i have needed to call to get information, whom ever i speak to, has always been so helpful and pleasant! oh and anyone i notice anywhere, that is looking for/at ink cartridge replacements, i spontaneously suggest they might consider looking into 123inkjets online for their replacements, not only because of the great quality and good customer service, but also the quickness of the cartridges being delivered. i live in the tehachapi mountains of california, so that makes for few choices to find replacements up here, thus the cost up here reflecting "bigger demand with few places to choose from" pricing! :-)- Terry, 6/17/2017 

            Easy to find what i need. entire process from search to check out in less than 5 minutes- Inky123, 6/14/2017 

            I appreciate having a convenient way of shopping for critical items which are delivered in a timely manner.- Thankful, 6/14/2017 

            I have used 123inkjets many times. i am always satisfied with the product and the service for my onlne orders. i will continue to use them in the future and have and will again recommend them to friends and associates.- DianaB59, 6/14/2017 

            Good ink, good service, good value. been using 123inkjets for years.- LARedhead, 6/13/2017 

            I have been using 123 injets for at least 6 years and i am very satified with the products and prices- Dbald8, 6/13/2017 

            It's the best to buy ink cartridges. it has such a large variety of cartridges to choose from and shipping arrives on time. plus it's got great prices. i've never been disappointed with their products and continue to use them when i need new cartridges, .- Trudy, 6/13/2017 

            My order was promptly delivered at a very reasonable price. thank you.- Hudg, 6/13/2017 

            In this day and age of non customer service, 123inkjets is a refreshing and renewed faith it still exists!!!! always helpful, always accommodating.- Happy customer, 6/12/2017 

            Ordering was painless!! order arrived before expectations. prices were/are very good. order was correct!!- "oleguy", 6/12/2017 

            I am pretty happy and satisfied with purchasing from 123 inkjets. it is so much more economical. the order was a back up for my current cartridge so i will use it when my current runs out which is soon.- Ronay, 6/11/2017 

            I was very pleased with the whole process and my order. i will order all my ink from you in the future.- Jim, 6/11/2017

 Dear inkfarm:I just wanted to let you know that your remanufactured inkjet cartridges are the best that I have used. I have tried many comanys cartridges.

The print quality is very good and I think they even last a bit longer than the original HP ink cartridges! Keep up the excellent work. -D.P, San Diego, CAMore testimonials...  Wow!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
