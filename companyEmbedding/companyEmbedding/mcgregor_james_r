McGregors, Iowa’s oldest family-owned furniture store, began in 1896 when James R. McGregor and partner, Charles Stull, opened Stull and McGregor in Oskaloosa.1904The original store was destroyed by fire in 1904. The partners divided up the assets and James R. McGregor rebuilt the store the following year. The new store opened under the new name of McGregors.1920sJames’ sons James Jr. (Sandy) and Charles (CD) joined the business in the early 1920’s.1928In 1928, Charles moved to Marshalltown and opened up the second McGregors location on West Main Street.1950sIn the 1950’s McGregors sold carpet from large rolls. However, in the early 1900’s carpet came to McGregors in 27” widths. The lengths of carpet then had to be sewn together in the backroom before being delivered to the customer.TodayToday, Erin McGregor, James McGregor’s Great-Granddaughter, is President and Marshalltown is home to the McGregors corporate headquarters.Read moreAs a family owned business, McGregors Furniture takes pride in giving back to the communities in which we live and work. Each year McGregors gives back and participates in multiple charity efforts. In our “Share The Comfort” annual event, we have given almost $19,000 to the Ronald McDonald House, usually part of the sales from the annual January and February promotions. Partnering with the American Cancer Society, McGregors participates in two events and promotions each year. Using our Pink Ribbon Mattress product, which is marketed with bedding partner Restonic, McGregors and Restonic have given in excess of $30,000 since it’s inception. Each McGregors location also participates in their local Relay for Life each year. Our employees give of their time and also raise contributions for this very worthy event each year.

McGregor, Sir James Robert (1889–1973)
by R. M. Gibbs
This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 15, (MUP), 2000
This is a shared entry with Harold Waddell McGregor



	Sir James Robert McGregor (1889-1973) and Harold Waddell McGregor (1898-1978), woolbrokers, were born on 1 October 1889 and 9 December 1898 at Hindmarsh, Adelaide, eldest and third sons of Scottish-born James Wigham McGregor, woollen manufacturer, and his wife Mary Twaddle, née Waddell. Trained in Scotland, James senior had arrived in Adelaide in 1882. He later established the Torrenside woollen mills at Thebarton and represented Bradford buyers, especially W. & J. Whitehead; he also owned pastoral properties and had plantation interests on Bougainville. As a member of the Federal government's advisory committee, he helped to devise a table of types and limits in 1916 to value the Australian wool clip for wartime sale to Britain. James junior and Harold were both educated at Prince Alfred College. They entered their father's firm, gained experience at Whitehead's topmaking and spinning business, and acquired an outstanding technical knowledge of wool. Like their father, they were to profit by setting up testing plants in wool-selling centres to estimate the clean value of the product.

	About 1908 James established a branch of J. W. McGregor & Co. in Sydney, concentrating on the markets there and in Brisbane. His technical and trading skills, enhanced by contacts with Whitehead's and other overseas buyers, soon made him wealthy. On 22 December 1916 he was appointed wool appraiser for the New South Wales committee and buyers' representative for the Queensland committee, both of which served the Commonwealth Central Wool Committee. In the following year he became wool appraiser for the national body. At St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, on 10 August 1921 he married Alice Constance Taylor, a stenographer; they were to remain childless. With Harold, he set up companies in the Channel Islands to control the firm's substantial topmaking interests in Europe, though they held their Australian interests separately after their father's death in 1925.

	James centred his business on his well-known office in Bond Street, Sydney, and travelled abroad regularly. Renowned for his expertise, he again played a leading role (including framing the table of limits) in the Central Wool Committee which was re-established in September 1939 to control wartime wool disposal. Its chairman praised him in 1945 for his 'almost super-human efforts'. In peacetime McGregor traded extensively, expanding his activities and offices during the Korean War wool boom, increasing his shareholding in the Bougainville plantations and becoming known as Australia's largest wool-buyer—at one Brisbane series he bought a third of the offering for about £1.9 million. McGregor's staff and overseas clients esteemed him highly. A small, dark-haired man of forthright opinions, he was unruffled, well organized and courageous. His ability and charm impressed others and won him the friendship of (Sir) Robert Menzies who described him as 'the great Australian wool authority' and 'one of the best men I ever knew'. In 1956 McGregor was appointed K.B.E. When entertaining at his home, Neidpath, at Darling Point, he shared his love of fine wine and food.

	McGregor's wealth, good taste and knowledge of art enabled him to build an outstanding collection of sculptures and paintings, including works by Australian, English and French artists. Friendly with (Sir) William Ashton, Sir Lionel Lindsay, Sir Daryl Lindsay and Adrian Feint, he extended patronage to several artists and donated works to galleries. In 1929-58 he served as a trustee of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. For him, appreciating art required an imaginative understanding similar to the capacity to judge what a sample of wool might yield. While travelling in the United States of America, Sir James died on 3 August 1973 at St Francis Memorial Hospital, San Francisco, and was cremated; his wife predeceased him. His estate was sworn for probate at $935,348.

	Based in Adelaide and buying out another brother's holding in the family business, Harold McGregor focused on the more difficult South and Western Australian wool markets, and operated in the Victorian market jointly with James. His widespread commercial activities involved much overseas travel. At St Columba's Church, Chelsea, London, on 12 April 1934 he married Suzanne Marie Régine Scamps with the forms of the Church of Scotland. Harold's business flair and attention to detail, together with rising wool prices, enabled him to do well. His skill in judging wool led to his appointment as controlling appraiser for South Australia during World War II. For most of the Korean War he and James operated together and their extensive trading proved very successful. From 1950 Harold had developed large land holdings, the most significant being Balquhidder in South Australia, and Glenalpine and Toonambool in Victoria; he also held interests in real estate in Adelaide and other businesses. Like James, he played a leading role in the Australian Council of Woolbuyers and was a discerning collector of art, but in temperament he was more reticent and no bon vivant. Respecting the Scottish traits of quiet service and private giving, and having often needed hospital accommodation himself when beds were short, Harold took up the cause of Adelaide's St Andrew's Hospital, a private institution associated with the Presbyterian Church. He organized a family donation of £25,000 to its building fund in 1952 and gave large sums of money himself; he harried a reluctant government to help, advising it that he was 'somewhat weary of digging deep into my own pocket and pressing my family and friends to give'; and he guaranteed, personally and anonymously, the hospital's large mortgage for its new building in 1961. As board chairman (1960-71), he worked tirelessly for the expanding hospital as it assumed a large training role. For many years he was an elder of Adelaide's Scots Church, to which he and James gave an outstanding set of stained-glass windows by Lawrence Lee in memory of their parents. As a young man Harold had been a competent yachtsman. Ill health dogged his final years.

HistoryCommunity Involvement




A Century of Service!





1896
Families like yours have been buying furnishings from the McGregor family since 1896. McGregors, Iowa’s oldest family-owned furniture store, began in 1896 when James R. McGregor and partner, Charles Stull, opened Stull and McGregor in Oskaloosa.

1904
The original store was destroyed by fire in 1904. The partners divided up the assets and James R. McGregor rebuilt the store the following year. The new store opened under the new name of McGregors.

1920s
James’ sons James Jr. (Sandy) and Charles (CD) joined the business in the early 1920’s.

1928
In 1928, Charles moved to Marshalltown and opened up the second McGregors location on West Main Street.

 
1950s
In the 1950’s McGregors sold carpet from large rolls. However, in the early 1900’s carpet came to McGregors in 27” widths. The lengths of carpet then had to be sewn together in the backroom before being delivered to the customer.

Today
Today, Erin McGregor, James McGregor’s Great-Granddaughter, is President and Marshalltown is home to the McGregors corporate headquarters.






Un Siglo de Servicio!





The first store sold furniture, carpet and couch caskets. Caskets were a common commodity in furniture stores in those days.

1900s
In the early 1900’s deliveries were made by mule drawn wagon. McGregors mules’ names were Tom and Jerry. Since deliveries were made by a mule drawn wagon, if the delivery was to a distant home, McGregors delivery men would need to spend the night at the customer’s home.
1914 – 1929
Below is a picture of employee Ray Bonnett and his son next to a delivery vehicle. Ray worked for McGregors from 1914 to 1929 and furnished his entire house for $343.32 using his 20 percent McGregors employee discount.

1924
In 1924 James R. McGregor Sr. and his sons decided to build a new building in Oskaloosa. The new building afforded McGregors an updated building with more space to show merchandise to their customers.

1930s
The new McGregors location in Marshalltown had a façade that was an example of the Italianate style of architecture. In the early 1930’s, stores were open on Saturday nights because farmers came to town to shop.
1945,1946,1963, 1974, 1987
Over the years, McGregors has welcomed additional locations to its family of stores: Ottumwa (1945), Waterloo (1946), Mason City (1963), Fort Dodge (1974) and Coralville (1987).
1996
The following picture shows James and Robert during the company’s 100 year celebration in 1996.

Since opening its first store in 1896 McGregors has expanded to six stores with delivery to Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois and, of course, Iowa. That rich history of serving you ensures that like in the past, the McGregors family will be here to serve your family now and well into the future.







Community Involvement
As a family owned business, McGregors Furniture takes pride in giving back to the communities in which we live and work. Each year McGregors gives back and participates in multiple charity efforts. In our “Share The Comfort” annual event, we have given almost $19,000 to the Ronald McDonald House, usually part of the sales from the annual January and February promotions. Partnering with the American Cancer Society, McGregors participates in two events and promotions each year. Using our Pink Ribbon Mattress product, which is marketed with bedding partner Restonic, McGregors and Restonic have given in excess of $30,000 since it’s inception. Each McGregors location also participates in their local Relay for Life each year. Our employees give of their time and also raise contributions for this very worthy event each year. Each year we donate a Queen Pink Ribbon Bedding set in conjunction with the “Relay for Life” campaign in each of our six communities.
McGregors Furniture is also an active supporter of United Way and the Iowa College Foundation. Donating annually for over 20 years to United Way and well over 40 years to the Iowa College Foundation, McGregors believes in the future and education of Iowa’s young people. McGregors is proud to serve six communities across the state of Iowa.
