CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th.

BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.

CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $86.67 (3.35% upside)

Our investment solutions are based on a time-tested investment approach and decision-making process that begins and ends with each client.


Investing
We take time to listen and fully understand each client’s situation before creating an investment program that reflects their distinctive goals, objectives and risk tolerance.








We utilize securities from the major asset classes to tailor investment solutions that are as unique as our clients


Fixed Income

Government bonds
Corporate bonds
Municipal bonds
Convertible bonds



Equities

Common stock
Convertible preferred
stock




Within these broad asset classes we consider a wide range of opportunity: small, mid and large cap shares, core, growth and value stocks, high yield as well as high quality bonds, and non-US securities.
An expansive network of professional resources extends the range of solutions available to clients for whom exposure to non-traditional asset class portfolios make sense






A common-sense philosophical foundation gives direction to each aspect of our investment decision-making process.





Long Term Perspective



A longer-term perspective focuses our attention on the factors driving long-term wealth creation.…more

In the long run, security prices track closely with growth in earnings and cash flow. In the short term, quarterly earnings announcements, world news, rumors, analyst recommendations, program trading or short selling squeezes can trigger volatility in stock prices that have little to do with the underlying ability of a company to continue generating cash flow or its related underlying value. We often use these price swings to our advantage, but realize that the fundamental factors driving a company’s prospects over a longer time frame are generally more transparent and rational. We therefore focus on a three to five year time horizon when assessing the investment potential of portfolio candidates, and prefer to measure our results over that time frame.









Unconstrained Investment  Universe



An unconstrained investment universe generates greater opportunity and insight…more

Many of our investment ideas are generated through research of economic and industry trends and the companies fulfilling the needs implied by such trends. The industry ecosystem surrounding a trend typically contains numerous companies. Some companies are large, some small, some fast growing, some not. Some have attractive business models (unique abilities or intellectual property, high profitability, low capital requirements, good growth prospects) and some have poor business models. If a manager studying the companies involved in an ecosystem is restricted to only large capitalization value stocks, the manager may be limited to only the weakest players in the industry, or even shut out. In contrast, a manager able to evaluate all types – large, small, new, established, growth, value – will likely possess a stronger understanding of that entire ecosystem and thus have a greater chance of selecting those securities that will lead to greater returns.









Multiple Analytical  Perspectives



The rigorous application of multiple analytical perspectives creates a disciplined framework for evaluating all investment ideas…more

The investment thesis for each potential holding is based upon our comprehensive analysis of a company’s opportunity from three perspectives:
Trend: the socio-economic, technology transition, or supply/demand trends with the potential to support or undermine a company’s cash flow growth
Business Model: the package of strategic and operational attributes that allow a company to convert demand into positive cash flow and then defend and further enhance that growth
Valuation: the worth of a company’s security vis-à-vis the quality of the applicable trend and strength and sustainability of its business model
The relative emphasis we place on one perspective versus another varies by investment program. In our most conservative portfolios, valuation is more important than trend, while in our more aggressive portfolios, the opposite is true. Moreover, we seek a balance of the three perspectives that is appropriate to a specific company’s situation. For example, if a prospective investment that stands to benefit from a strong industry trend has a good but not outstanding business model, we prefer a cheaper valuation. On the other hand, if we find another trend beneficiary with an exceptional business model, we may be willing to accept a richer valuation.









Independent Research



Intensive “on-the-ground” research and forward-looking analysis leads us to an uncommon concept of risk…more

Many in the investment industry, particularly those adhering to a ‘style-box’ (e.g. large cap value, or small cap growth) approach, define risk as a variance of portfolio returns from those of a widely accepted benchmark. For example, a portfolio that has a steady but moderate rate of return would be uncorrelated to a market benchmark whose returns are volatile and over time lower than the portfolio’s. This lack of correlation is considered benchmark ‘risk’ by today’s standards, and something to be avoided, even though the portfolio’s return and volatility profile was better than the benchmark’s.
We define risk as a measure of the future, not the past, and our definition of risk is company-specific. Our risk management approach revolves around the two fundamental dimensions every company and stock face in its lifetime: enterprise (or business) risk and valuation (or price) risk. Enterprise risk is the risk of a business underperforming or failing, resulting in a permanent loss of capital; valuation risk is the risk of paying too much now for future profit growth. We focus on the current and future internal, environmental, and competitive factors that determine the level of enterprise and valuation risk a company embraces to determine the risks inherent in that company’s securities.









Style and Market Cap  Neutral



An opportunistic approach to portfolio construction enhances the reward/risk profile of client portfolios…more

We construct style-agnostic portfolios with the securities of companies we believe most likely to generate returns consistent with our clients’ goals. We let the reward/risk profile of a potential investment, not style or size characteristics, be the limiting factor in our search for the best ideas.
Portfolio holdings and position sizes reflect our perceptions of opportunity and risk, not benchmark names or sector weights. In our view, managing to a benchmark is managing to a rear-view mirror. A benchmark’s highly weighted sectors reflect prior long-term outperformance, not future outperformance prospects.









Focused Number of  Holdings



A focused number of portfolio holdings avoids over-diversification and enhances returns…more

The number of stocks in a PPSG portfolio typically ranges between 20 and 35, and our interests generally keep us in at least five or six different sectors of the economy. While some diversification is desirable for nearly all investment objectives, once a portfolio contains about twenty stocks from a number of different industries, the benefit of diversification has been achieved (i.e. the impact of any one stock or industry on the performance of the total portfolio is limited).
Moreover, we believe that superior returns come from investing with insight and conviction. Portfolios of 20 to 35 names are focused on those opportunities in which we have strong conviction, and the size of each position is large enough to impact performance.










The goal of our disciplined investment process is to optimize the balance between reward and risk in each client portfolio.

Conducting our own research enhances our ability to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of individual securities.
The heart of our analytical work is a three-part lens through which we assess each investment idea

Trend: Will this company be the beneficiary of powerful and long lasting industry or economic growth trends?
Business Model: How does this company make money? How secure and sustainable is its competitive advantage?
Valuation: Is this security overpriced? Has the market priced this security commensurate or less than our valuation?



This framework imposes a disciplined structure on our decision-making yet is sensitive to the varying characteristics of companies within our broad investment universe and to market trends
Our portfolio construction emphasizes the diversification of risk across the whole portfolio.
Lastly, we take time to communicate with our clients about what they own in their portfolios and why. 
Our job as advisor and investment manager isn’t complete until we’ve earned each client’s trust and confidence in our ability to secure their financial future. The strongest trust is built on knowledge and transparency. That’s why PPSG clients have a direct relationship with the professional making the investment decisions for their portfolio, and its why we take the time to explain our thinking and actions.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
