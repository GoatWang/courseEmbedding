 We're In It Together 
 WestEnd Capital Management, LLC (WCM) is an independent asset management company based in San Francisco, CA. Our primary goal is simply to deliver investment returns that outperform the market over time.  

 We Work For You 
 We’re not a commission-based brokerage. We don’t earn fees by encouraging frenetic buying and selling. In fact, we charge only a small 1.5% management fee, plus minimal transaction charges.  

 Our Commitment to You 
 More importantly, we don’t simply invest for our clients, we invest with our clients. We have a portion of our own assets—and the assets of some of our family members—under management alongside those of our clients. We’re in this together.

About Us

Around 2000–2001, we heard from many investors who felt they were being overcharged for underperforming investments. We founded WestEnd Capital Mangement in 2002 in response to these investors, who were seeking an alternative to the high commission and fee-heavy asset management accounts common at the time. Since then, we’ve proven that it’s possible to provide outstanding performance of customized investment portfolios for a reasonable fee. We do it year in and year out.   We are not broker/dealers and derive absolutely no income from transaction charges. We have no incentive to churn your investments. Our sole focus is the performance of your portfolio. Read on to meet the team members who will be serving you. Then call us to learn more, or to discuss opening an account.







 George B. Bolton 
  
  
  
 Chief Investment Officer, Portfolio Manager 
 George has been in the financial services business since graduating with honors from the University of Virginia in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics.    After college, George joined Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore, Maryland and rose quickly, becoming a principal in 1989. In 1987, George relocated to San Francisco after the firm won the IPO business for Microsoft and Oracle and needed someone to lead the institutional equity sales team. Under George’s leadership, sales jumped ten-fold from 1987 to 1990. In 1991, George became the youngest Managing Partner at Alex Brown.  While leading institutional equity sales on the West Coast, George also successfully ran separately managed accounts for high net worth individuals and generated notable returns well in excess of leading industry indexes.   In 2004, after a highly successful career, George left DB Alex Brown to become a Partner and Chief Investment Officer at WestEnd Capital Management. George brought his own assets and many of his high net worth clients to WCM and continues to deliver notable returns to our clients.    George lives in San Diego with his wife Leia and has three sons.  

 Gus Ozag

 Gus assists our clients in coordinating the management of their assets with comprehensive financial planning (i.e. risk management, as well as estate, retirement, investment and tax planning). His services are available to all WestEnd clients at no additional charge. Gus is a big believer in regular client communication, and says, “Frequent feedback from our clients is the best way to monitor our performance.  bottom line.”   A founder of WestEnd, Gus has over 30 years of financial planning experience. He is a certified financial planner (CFP), chartered financial consultant (ChFC) and chartered life underwriter (CLU).

 George T. Elliman 
  
  
  
 Director of Business Development 
 George brings over 20 years of marketing and business development experience to WestEnd. He also has the unique insight of having been George Bolton's client since 1997 and a WestEnd client since 2004 before he joined the firm in 2006.
“As a client, it was a great feeling knowing my investment management company was taking its own advice and investing along with me,” he says. “At WestEnd, we share the same risks and rewards as our clients. I ask people, does your current financial advisor have the same incentive to watch your portfolio?”
Prior to WestEnd, George served in a variety of marketing and business development roles at Gemini Consulting (serving the Fortune 100), Compaq Computer Corporation, Vignette Corporation, Door Number 3 Advertising and TBridge Ventures, Inc. George has a BA degree in Political Science from Middlebury College and an MBA from the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia.

Our Philosophy

We invest for our clients just like we would for ourselves and our family members. And this isn’t just our philosophy—it’s our reality. We have some of our assets—and the assets of some of our family members—invested alongside the assets of our clients. This creates an intimate level of accountability in everything we do, and it gives our clients the confidence that we’re treating their money like we would our own family’s.




Core Investment Philosophy
We have evolved and fine-tuned our strategy over multiple decades of investment decision-making. This means we’ve seen various market cycles of expansion and contraction, with corresponding bulls and bears, and we have been able to nurture our successes while learning from our mistakes—investment qualities only attained through years of experience. 
We firmly believe that over the long-term, it is best to invest in market-leading, innovative companies. Our experience informs us that these are the companies that not only post exceptional results, but that also consistently set high expectations for future growth. We believe that when a company sets high expectations and proceeds to exceed them, strong stock performance typically follows.  
Analyzing individual stocks is at the crux of our approach to investing. At the end of the day, we strive to assemble portfolios that are invested in quality companies well-positioned to surprise Wall St. and the world with their innovations, rapid market penetration, and growth. 
 
Strategy and Approach
The goal of each WestEnd product is to significantly outperform all comparable benchmarks --- while simultaneously generating high absolute returns over the long-term.  Each product is designed to address a client’s specific investment objectives with regards to desired growth and risk—meaning we can customize our approach to fit your needs. 
In general, we strive to generate aggressive growth of capital through ownership of companies with high growth rates and the demonstrated ability to exceed expectations, while also positioning in companies we expect to grow “steadily and sturdily.” The latter type of company has generally been around longer and has a bigger market capitalization, with our ownership designed to reduce volatility and lower overall portfolio risk. 
Finally, because we place such a high value on a company’s ability to exceed growth expectations, we are constantly scrutinizing each position in the portfolio to ensure it is on track. We will not hesitate to remove a position from the portfolio if we sense it will struggle to exceed the market’s expectations.

Investing with Us

We’re committed to letting you know exactly what you can expect from a partnership with WestEnd Capital Management at every step of the way. Here we outline the basic services available to every client, along with a look at our portfolio of products. Call us when you are ready to begin, or to schedule a consultation with our partners.




Client Service
Every client's interactions with their money manager should be easy, convenient, and educational --- which is exactly why those are the three pillars for client service at WestEnd.  We enjoy hearing from our clients and encourage them to reach out, whether by phone, email, or in-person. We are available for in-person meetings and—in what we believe is unique to our industry—we invite all clients to participate in weekly portfolio review conference calls. 
We also compose a “Global Economic and Market Review” each quarter, which details our thoughts on the markets for the previous three months and offers portfolio strategy insights for our clients to stay up-to-speed. 
Finally, for clients with accounts held at Charles Schwab, portfolio reviews are available online at any time, and we provide quarterly or monthly performance reports depending on your individual portfolio product allocation.
 
Investment Products

We offer separately managed accounts, which may be allocated to three different portfolios:  Core Growth Equity, Equity Income, and Aggressive Growth.  
Our Core Growth Equity Portfolio invests in a diverse group of 30-40 common stocks. The primary objective is long-term capital appreciation—producing returns exceeding those of broad equity benchmarks over time. The portfolio seeks to do so with similar or less overall risk than its benchmark equity index.  
Our Equity Income Portfolio invests in 25-30 securities primarily for current income, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The portfolio is invested in common stocks, preferred stocks, REIT’s, MLP’s, and similar income-generating instruments.  
Lastly, our Aggressive Growth Portfolio is a highly concentrated allocation of 10-15 of our highest conviction, relatively high-risk ideas.  
 
WestEnd also manages an investment partnership (hedge fund).  For more information on this product or any of the others mentioned above, please contact us directly.
