Tyndall Capital Philosophy











																											Innovation, intelligence & due diligence																									
Leading  in innovative thinking, Tyndall Capital has performed extensive research in the  Australian lending market for lending facilities. As a result, it has  established Marketlend, to fulfil a real need for both investors and borrowers  alike.Under  the name Marketlend, it offers a marketplace lending solution using a hosted  system that manages the entire peer-to-peer lending process. This service is  further enhanced with insurance, a robust legal structure, predictability  software for the rating of the risk, and a secure payment system. The process  from application to paying the borrower can be a short as 10 minutes.This  proven system is already used in the UK and is leading the charge to create  what is emerging as an estimated $1 Trillion loan market in the US alone by  2025*(Footnote:  *A Trillion dollar market by the people, for the people by Charles Moldow,  General Partner, Foundation Capital, 2013)
