There is no guarantee the Company will be able to sell the shares being offered
in this prospectus. If it is unable to sell enough shares to complete its plan
of operations, the business could fail.


The green industry as a whole is highly competitive. The Company faces intense
competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local
and national companies. 

The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no
assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its market position or
expand its business.

Many of the Company’s current and potential competitors are well established and
have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational
resources, and name recognition than the Company has. However, we believe that
with our management’s unique experience and expertise, we will be able to
increase sales and gain direct access to acquisition prospects. Although there
are many green industry companies with which we currently compete, we believe
that our marketplace, once operational, will all us to compete due to the fact
that a wide variety of products and services may be presented on the site from a
potentially worldwide user base.


Company Description
Ziwira, Inc. was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 21,
2015 with plans to operate an online portal for green industry topics, products
and services. The Company currently has authorized 250,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.0001 The Company plans to develop a


 web-based platform that
acts as a green energy portal, where users can exchange ideas and information,
and can also buy and sell environmentally friendly services and products. The
company plans to receive fees for advertisement from users and a commission when
products or services are purchased on the platform between users. The Company
currently has no customers or users and has not generated any revenues. Our
business operations to date have been related to the development of our website
platform, which, once completed, will allow us to begin developing a user base.

The Company’s current business plans include developing its online platform, in
order to feature information, user services and products, and also grow its user
base. The Company’s immediate plan is to generate revenue by way of receiving
commissions and subscription fees from users, with the goal of becoming a one
stop shop of information, products and services in the green industry. The
Company currently has no customers or users and has not generated any revenues.
The Company intends to provide the platform whereby green information, products
and services may be shared, bought and sold between users. Our business
operations to date have been related to the development of our website platform,
which, once completed, will allow us to begin developing a user base. The terms
website, platform, marketplace and portal are used interchangeably in this
prospectus. The Company plans to initially market to potential users in the 
United States and the Middle East, specifically Dubai.

The Company hopes to develop its user base to include individuals, corporate
entities and government agencies, all of which would be able to exchange
information, products and services through the online platform. The Company
believes that by using a web-based portal, there exists the ability for users
from all countries to access the same information, which would allow for a
geographically diverse user base. Currently, the Company does not have any
users, but plans to begin marketing the website as soon as development is
complete, which the company expects will take approximately six months from the
completion of this offering due to the fact that the Company intends to use a
portion of the proceeds from this offering to develop its website. In order to
pursue its strategic objectives, the Company plans to utilize a portion of the
proceeds received from this offering, as well as its available cash, cash
generated from operations and additional cash as may be raised via equity or
debt offerings as may be approved by its Board of Directors.
 
The administrative office of the Company is located at 445 Park Avenue, 9th
Floor, New York, NY 10022. The Company’s phone number is 800-953-6593.
