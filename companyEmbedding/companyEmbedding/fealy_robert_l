Duchossois Group president exits as family restructures business


Duchossois Group Inc. President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Fealy will step down at the end of June as part of the Duchossois family's restructuring of its $2 billion business.Mr. Fealy, 62, has held the post at the Elmhurst-based conglomerate since 2008. He's leaving now after the family announced in December that it's cashing out of some of its bigger businesses to better diversify its assets and make plans for passing wealth along to the next generation. Duchossois Group is led by CEO Craig Duchossois, 69, and his father, Richard, 92, who is chairman and founder of the family business. The company exited two of its three major holdings in the past six months, selling Richardson, Texas-based audio and video systems company AMX LLC to Harman International Industries Inc. for $365 million last month and shedding a controlling stake in Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based flat-screen equipment company Milestone AV Technologies in December in a deal with Chicago-based Pritzker Group.That leaves Duchossois Group with full ownership of just one big company, Elmhurst-based garage door opener maker Chamberlain Group Inc., and a significant stake in Louisville, Kentucky-based horse racetrack company Churchill Downs Inc.  In December, the family shifted its technology venture and growth phase company investments into a new firm, Duchossois Capital Management LLC, and appointed Michael Flannery as president of that business.OPERATING FOCUS ON CHAMBERLAIN “Over my 18 years with the Duchossois family, we have completed a number of strategic transactions, including the divestiture of our rail car and defense manufacturing businesses, the merger of Arlington Park with Churchill Downs, and now more recently the divestiture of Milestone and AMX,” Mr. Fealy said in a statement. “Going forward, the operating focus will be concentrated on growing our Chamberlain business, and so this is a good time for me to step back.”He was Duchossois Group's chief financial officer for 11 years before becoming president and chief operating officer and will remain a consultant to the company. He'll also continue to serve on the board of Churchill Downs and as chairman of a smaller Duchossois business, Bethesda, Maryland-based control systems company Brivo Systems LLC. In addition, Mr. Fealy will still be a figure on the Chicago corporate and philanthropic scenes, as chair of venture-capital fund Chicago Ventures, vice chair of the Illinois Venture Capital Association and chairman-elect of the Chicago Children's Choir. Craig Duchossois couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
