      Fitch Affirms UBS-BB 2013-C6
    





February 24, 2016 04:52 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Barclays Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities LLC's UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C6, 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2013-C6. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced 
      loans since issuance. The pool has experienced no realized losses to 
      date and Fitch has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern.
    

      As of the February 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 2.6% to $1.26 billion from $1.3 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (0.1% of the 
      pool) is defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class G.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (10%) is the 575 Broadway loan; a 169,450 
      square-foot (sf) mixed-use property located at 575 Broadway in 
      Manhattan, New York, NY. Originally purchased by the sponsor in 1989 for 
      $9.6 million, the property is now occupied by a mix of retail and office 
      tenants including Prada (retail), Estee Lauder, Inc. (office), Code and 
      Theory (office) and Coldwater Creek (office). According to the January 
      2016 rent roll, the property is 100% occupied. The debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) for the interest-only loan was reported to be 3.64x as of 
      year-end (YE) 2014. At issuance, the occupancy and DSCR was 93% and 
      3.54x, respectively.
    

      The second largest loan (6.1%) is the Shoppes at River Crossing loan, 
      which is secured by a 727,963 sf shopping center, of which 527,963 sf is 
      collateral. The property, located in Macon, GA, which is roughly 75 
      miles south of Atlanta, is a lifestyle center with a power center 
      component. Built in 2008, the subject is anchored by Belk's (ground 
      lease) and Dillard's (not part of collateral). Other tenants include 
      Dick's, Barnes & Noble and Joann Fabrics. As of YE 2014, occupancy was 
      reported to be 95% and a 2.62x DSCR.
    

      The third largest loan (6%) is the 2000 Market Street loan, which is 
      secured by a 29-story, 665,649 sf office building located in the central 
      business district of Philadelphia, PA. The property has a mix of 65 
      office tenants with the largest tenants including law firms Marshall, 
      Dennehey, Warner, Coleman & Goggin, and Fox Rothschild, LLP as well as 
      the Board of Pensions of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), who are all 
      on long-term leases and combine to occupy 49% of the net rentable area. 
      Occupancy was reported to be 96% as of September 2015 and the DSCR was 
      2.18x, both in-line with issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Rating Outlooks remain Stable. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 1.5% 
of the current balance, compared to 1.6% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 1.4% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.6% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additional, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating 
Structured Finance Interest-Only Securities" published in 
October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 19, 
compared to 20 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the January 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 4% to $1.248 
billion from $1.295 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 75 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 13% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 61% of the pool. 
One loan, constituting 10.1% of the pool, has 
an investment-grade structured credit assessments. Three 
loans, constituting 2.4% of the pool, have defeased 
and are secured by US government securities.




One loan, constituting 0.4% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting 0.4% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. This loan is the Mira Vista Apartments 
($5.4 million), which is secured by a 352 unit multifamily 
complex located in Houston, Texas. The loan transferred to 
special servicing in June 2015 due to imminent default and is currently 
paid thru the October 2016 payment date. Based on the year-end 
2015 reported net operating income (NOI), the debt yield is over 
12.5%. 




Moody's received full or partial year 2015 operating results for 100% 
of the pool, and partial year 2016 operating results for 64% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 92%, unchanged 
from Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted 
average haircut of 13% to the most recently available net operating 
income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.2%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.86X and 1.14X, 
respectively, roughly unchanged from the last review. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the 575 Broadway Loan 
($125.85 million -- 10.1% of the pool), 
which is secured by a 170,000 square foot (SF) mixed use retail 
and office building located in Manhattan's SoHo submarket. 
The property is encumbered by a ground lease that is scheduled to expire 
in June 2060. As of September 2016 the property was 100% 
leased, compared to 92% in June 2015 and 94% in September 
2013. Property perfromance based on the trailing nine months as 
of September 2016 has improved in part due to office rents increasing 
to over $80 per square foot (PSF) from approximately $63 
PSF at securitization. Current office rents are in line with the 
submarket. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR 
are aa3 (sca.pd) and 1.38X, respectively, compared 
to aa3 (sca.pd) and 1.42X at the last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 27% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Gateway Center Loan ($160.0 million 
-- 12.8% of the pool), which is secured by three 
cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans secured by 
354,762 SF within a 638,871 SF class A anchored retail center 
in Brooklyn, New York. The property was constructed in 2002 
by The Related Companies. The properties are shadow anchored by 
Target and Home Depot. Collateral tenants include BJ's Wholesale 
Club (lease expiration: September 2027), Bed Bath & Beyond 
(January 2018), and Babies R US (January 2018). As of September 
2016, the property was 100% leased, unchanged since 
securitization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 110% and 
0.78X, respectively, unchanged since the last review.




The second largest loan is the Broward Mall Loan ($95.0 
million -- 7.6% of the pool), which is secured 
by 325,701 SF within a 1.042 million SF super-regional 
mall located in Plantation, Florida. The mall is anchored 
by Sears, Macy's, JC Penney and Dillards, none 
of which are part of the collateral. As of June 2016, total 
mall, collateral, and inline occupancy were 96%, 
88%, and 85% leased, respectively, compared 
to securitization total mall, collateral, and inline occupancy 
levels of 95%, 83%, and 84% leased, 
respectively. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 83% and 
1.17X, respectively, unchanged from the last review.




The third largest loan is The Shoppes at River Crossing Loan ($77.35 
million -- 6.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by 527,963 SF within a 727,963 SF lifestyle center located 
in Macon, Georgia. Non-collateral anchors include 
Dillard's and Belk. Collateral tenants include Dick's 
Sporting Goods, Barnes & Noble, Jo-Ann Fabric and 
Crafts, and DSW Shoe Warehouse. As of September 2016, 
inline space was 95% leased. As of November 2016, 
the running 12-month comparable inline sales were $362 PSF, 
up from September 2015 running 12-month comparable inline sales 
of $329 PSF. Property performance increased in 2015 due 
to revenue outpacing expense growth. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 108% and 0.98X, respectively, unchanged 
from the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed because the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes 
are consistent with Moody's expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.3% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://v3.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating Fusion U.S. CMBS Transactions" published in April 
2005. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v 
2.64, which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. 
Conduit model results at the Aa2 (sf) level are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Conduit model results at the 
B2 (sf) level are based on a paydown analysis using the individual loan-level 
Moody's LTV ratio. Moody's may consider other concentrations 
and correlations in its analysis. Based on the model pooled credit 
enhancement levels of Aa2 (sf) and B2 (sf), the required credit 
enhancement on the remaining conduit classes are either interpolated between 
these two data points or determined based on a multiple or ratio of either 
of these two data points. For fusion deals, Moody's 
merges the credit enhancement for loans with investment-grade credit 
assessments with the conduit model credit enhancement for an overall model 
result. Moody's incorporates negative pooling (adding credit 
enhancement at the credit assessment level) for loans with similar credit 
assessments in the same transaction.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 12, 2014 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.3 
billion. The certificates are collateralized by 75 mortgage loans 
ranging in size from less than 1% to 12% of the pool, 
with the top ten loans constituting 59% of the pool. One 
loan, constituting 10% of the pool, has an investment-grade 
credit assessment.




Three loans, constituting 3% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool, and the deal has experienced 
no realized losses. No loans are currently in special servicing.




Moody's received partial year 2013 operating results for 30% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 97%, 
compared to 98% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with credit assessments, defeased and CTL 
loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 8% to 
the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.3%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.89X and 1.09X, 
respectively, compared to 1.84X and 1.06X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a credit assessment is the 575 Broadway Loan ($125.9 
million -- 9.8% of the pool), which is secured 
by six-story, 167,450 SF mixed-use building 
in Manhattan. The property is encumbered by a ground lease that 
is scheduled in expire in June 2060. As of September 2013, 
the property was 94% occupied compared to 93% at securitization. 
Moody's credit assessment and stressed DSCR are A3 and 1.42X, 
respectively, same as at secuitization.




The top three conduit loans represent 24% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Gateway Loan ($160 million -- 12.4% 
of the pool), which is secured by three cross-collateralized 
and cross-defaulted loans on a 350,000 SF component of a 
640,000 SF anchored retail center in Brooklyn, NY. 
The property was constructed in 2002 by The Related Companies and is three 
contiguous parcels that operate as one property. Non-collateral 
anchors include Target and Home Depot. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 110% and 0.78X, respectively, same 
as at securitzation.




The second largest loan is the The Shoppes at River Crossing Loan ($77.4 
million -- 6.0% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 525,000 SF component of a 730,000 SF lifestyle center 
located in Macon, GA. As of February 2013 the property was 
94% leased. Non-collateral anchors include Dillard's 
(200,000 SF) and Belk (133,218 SF). Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 108% and 0.98X, respectively, 
same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 2000 Market Street Loan ($77 million 
-- 6.0% of the pool), which is secured by a 29-story 
office tower located in the central business district of Philadelphia. 
Since construction the property has undergone multiple renovations totaling 
$8 million, the most recent of which occurred in 2007 and 
2012. As of January 2013, the property was 95% occupied. 
The two largest tenants, both law firms, have free rent periods 
that expired in August 2013. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 
106% and 0.92X, respectively, the same as at 
securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs.

Approximately $1.2 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 02, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed the ratings of fifteen

as follows:

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the thirteen P&I classes were affirmed because the 
transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within 
acceptable ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes, Class X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.0% 
of the current balance compared to 2.3% at Moody's 
prior review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected 
losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at 
http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.


Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
compared to 21 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 12, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.6% to $1.27 
billion from $1.30 billion at securitization. The 
Certificates are collateralized by 75 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 13% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) representing 60% of the pool. 
The pool contains one loan, representing 10% of the pool, 
that has an investment grade structured credit assessment.




Three loans, representing less than 1% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans which meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of our ongoing monitoring of a transaction, Moody's reviews 
the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could impact 
performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool, and the deal has experienced 
no realized losses. No loans are currently in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2013 operating results for 97% of the 
pool and full or partial year 2014 operating results for 53% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 96% compared 
to 97% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 6.2% 
to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.3%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.84X and 1.10X, 
respectively, compared to 1.89X and 1.09X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's net cash flow (NCF) 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based 
on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stressed rate applied to the 
loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the 575 Broadway Loan 
($125.9 million -- 9.9% of the pool), 
which is secured by a six-story, 169,450 SF mixed-use 
building in Manhattan. The property is encumbered by a ground lease 
that is scheduled in expire in June 2060. As of January 2015, 
the property was 92% leased compared to 94% leased as of 
September 2013. Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed 
DSCR are a3 (sca.pd) and 1.44X, respectively, 
compared to a3 (sca.pd) and 1.42X at the last review.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 26% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Gateway Center Loan ($160 
million -- 12.6% of the pool), which is secured 
by three cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans 
on a 350,000 SF component of a 640,000 SF anchored retail 
center in Brooklyn, NY. As of December 2014, the property 
was 100% leased. The property was constructed in 2002 by 
The Related Companies and is three contiguous parcels that operate as 
one property. Non-collateral anchors include Target and 
Home Depot. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 110% and 0.78X, 
respectively, the same as at last review.




The second largest loan is the Broward Mall Loan ($95 million -- 
7.5% of the pool), which is secured by 325,700 
SF of net rentable area (NRA) contained within a one million SF super-regional 
mall in Plantation, Florida. The mall's non-collateral 
anchors include Sears, Macy's, JC Penney, and 
Dillard's. The property was 88% leased as of September 
2014. The full-term interest-only loan matures in 
March 2023. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 92% and 1.06X.




The third largest loan is The Shoppes at River Crossing Loan ($77.4 
million -- 6.1% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 525,000 SF component of a 730,000 SF lifestyle center 
located in Macon, Georgia. The property was 94% leased 
as of September 2014, similar to last review. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 108% and 0.98X, respectively, 
the same as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $1.2 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, March 10, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on fifteen classes 
in UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C6 as follows:




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Apr

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 1.6% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.0% at Moody's 
last review. The deal has not experienced any realized losses and 
Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 1.6% 
of the original pooled balance, compared to 2.0% at 
the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base 
expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at




http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the February 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2.6% to $1.26 
billion from $1.30 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 75 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 13% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 60% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
10% of the pool, has an investment-grade structured 
credit assessment. One loan, constituting 0.1% 
of the pool, has defeased and is secured by US government securities.




Five loans, constituting 2.4% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool, and the deal has not 
experienced any realized losses. No loans are currently in special 
servicing.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 93% of the 
pool, and partial year 2015 operating results for 47% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 92%, 
compared to 96% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 9.7% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.87X and 1.14X, 
respectively, compared to 1.84X and 1.10X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the 575 Broadway Loan 
($125.9 million -- 10.0% of 
the pool), which is secured by a six-story mixed-use 
building in Manhattan. The property is encumbered by a ground lease 
that is scheduled in expire in June 2060. As of January 2016, 
the property was 100% leased, compared to 92% as of 
January 2015, and 94% leased as of September 2013.

of a 640,000 SF anchored retail center in Brooklyn, New York. 
As of September 2015, the property was 100% leased. 
The property was constructed in 2002 by The Related Companies and is three 
contiguous parcels that operate as one property. Non-collateral 
anchors include Target and Home Depot. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 110% and 0.78X, respectively, the same 
as at last review.




The second largest loan is the Broward Mall Loan ($95 million -- 
7.5% of the pool), which is secured by 325,700 
SF of net rentable area (NRA) contained within a one million SF super-regional 
mall in Plantation, Florida. The mall's non-collateral 
anchors include Sears, Macy's, JC Penney, and Dillard's. 
The property was 96% leased as of September 2015, compared 
to 88% leased as of September 2014. The full-term 
interest-only loan matures in March 2023. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 83% and 1.17X, respectively.




The third largest loan is The Shoppes at River Crossing Loan ($77.4 
million -- 6.1% of the pool), which 
is secured by a 525,000 SF component of a 730,000 SF lifestyle 
center located in Macon, Georgia. The property was 96% 
leased as of September 2015, compared to 94% leased as of 
September 2014. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 108% and 
0.98X, respectively, the same as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.














Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are based on stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced loans since issuance. As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.8% to $1.286 billion from $1.295 billion at issuance. Fitch has identified one Loan of Concern (0.1% of the pool) due to recent DSCR well below performance at issuance (below 1.0x as of Year End 2013).The largest loan in the pool (12.4%) is the Gateway Center loan; a 354,881 square foot (sf) anchored retail property located in Brooklyn, New York, NY. The property is part of a larger 638,871-sf retail center with shadow anchors Home Depot and Target owning their own ground and improvements. Other major tenants include BJ's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Babies R Us, Old Navy, Staples, Best Buy , as well as several restaurant tenants. Performance is stable with the property at 100% occupancy as of December 2013 and NOI DSCR at 1.73x as of Year End (YE) 2013.The second largest loan in the pool (9.8%) is the 575 Broadway loan; a 169,450 sf mixed-use property located at 575 Broadway in Manhattan, New York, NY. Originally purchased by the sponsor in 1989 for $9.6 million, the property is now occupied by a mix of retail and office tenants including Prada (retail), Estee Lauder, Inc. (office), Code and Theory (office) and Coldwater Creek (office). Performance is stable with occupancy at 94% and NOI DSCR at 3.07x as of September 2013.RATING SENSITIVITYRating Outlooks remain Stable. Due to the recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 'UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C6' (June 3, 2013), available at www.fitchratings.com.Fitch affirms the following classes:--$55.9 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$43.0 million class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$155.0 million class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$461.1 million class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$95.0 million class A-3FL 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$0 class A-3FX 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$87.0 million class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$111.7 million class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$90.7 million class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$50.2 million class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$48.6 million class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$25.9 million class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$19.4 million class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;--$1.019 billion* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$140.9 million* class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable.*Notional amount and interest only.Fitch does not rate the interest-only class X-C or class G certificates. A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement (RW&E) mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset class is available in the following report:--'UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C6-- Appendix' (June 3, 2013).Additional information on Fitch's criteria for analyzing U.S. CMBS transactions is available in the Dec. 11, 2013 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under the following headers: Structured Finance >> CMBS >> Criteria ReportsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSpanish Economy Expands at Fastest Pace in Almost Two YearsBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartMarketWatchChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings week3 Must-Own Stocks in 2017Banyan HillSponsoredWells Fargo faces angry questions after new sales abuses uncoveredReutersAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone park cracks down on sex harassmentAssociated PressThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceNever Buy Options [Do This Instead]Investing DailySponsoredVietnam says others should respect its right to drill for South China Sea oilReutersMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoPutin critic says Russian lawyer's Trump Tower meeting was about sanctionsGreg: A lawyer, a spy, a mob boss, and a money launder walk into a bar.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
