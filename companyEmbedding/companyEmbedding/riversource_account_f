Variable life insurance is a complex vehicle that is subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested
A fund underlying your contract in which a subaccount invests may have a name, portfolio manager, objectives, strategies and characteristics that are the same or substantially similar to those of a publicly-traded retail mutual fund. Despite these similarities, an underlying fund is not the same as any publicly traded retail mutual fund. Each underlying fund will have its own unique portfolio holdings, fees, operating expenses and operating results. The results of each underlying fund may differ significantly from any publicly-traded retail mutual fund.

History[edit]
The forerunner to RiverSource was established in 1894 as Investors Syndicate in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The syndicate changed its name to Investors Diversified Services, Inc. (IDS) in 1950.
In 1984 American Express bought IDS and integrated it into its own financial services division. In 2005, American Express spun off American Express Financial Advisors and it became an independent company named Ameriprise Financial. The new company created the RiverSource brand name for certain products and product lines.[1]
Products[edit]
Investments[edit]
RiverSource Investments provides mutual funds for individual investors and investment strategies for institutional investors.
William (Ted) Truscott, Ameriprise Financial chief investment officer and a former executive with Zurich Scudder Investments in Boston, joined what was then American Express Financial Advisors in 2001. He changed the structure of the mutual fund business by opening "boutique" offices in places such as Boston, Cambridge, Minneapolis and London, where portfolio managers hand-pick staff and develop their own investment strategies appropriate to the funds.
