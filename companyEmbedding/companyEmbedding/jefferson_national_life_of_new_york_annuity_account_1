Jefferson National









Jefferson National Life Insurance Company has been in business since 1937. The company is active in the variable annuity industry with products such as Monument Advisor.
Jefferson National is a leader and innovator in the field of variable annuities. The company was the first to offer a flat fee variable annuity.  
In contrast to conventional variable annuities which have fees that are a percentage of assets, the Monument Advisor Variable annuity comes with a flat fee of $20 per month.
Jefferson National has also been an innovator in the area of variable annuitiy distribution.  The company leverages technology to reach financial advisors and customers directly.  Jefferson National has also been very focused on the rapidly growing fee-based registered investment advisor (RIA) channel, with total sales through this channel recently surpassing $1 billion.

Information & Articles about Jefferson National






 Would it be advisable to switch from my annuity to another type of investment? 
  It's difficult to provide an in depth response without having some more detail on the type of annuity and your overall financial profile.  That said, here are some points to consider and potentially present to your financial or tax advisor:

Let's assume that you have a variable annuity.  Variable annuities can be very expensive with total fees ranging from 1.5 - over 3 percent.  High fees are a huge drag on investment performance so this is a real consideration.  This site publishes a basic database that has fee information for hundreds of different variable annuities.  Think about doing some basic research or asking your financial advisor to understand what total fees are for your product.
You really need to understand whether you would incur surrender fees / surrender charges if you terminate your annuity.  You may be beyong the time-frame that these fees would apply, but you want to look at the product prospectus or ask your advisor if they apply to avoid any fees. 
Keep in mind that not all variable annuities come with high fees.  For example, Jefferson National provides a very interesting low fee variable annuity. 
Annuities--including variable annuities--are tax advantaged products.  These tax advantages are meaningful.  You should consider this in light of any change and discuss with your advisors.
The reality is that most people use variable annuities for investment growth and tax advantaged accumulation purposes.  In other words, the vast majority of people never turn-on or use the income generating features associated with their variable annuities.  Maybe this is relevant to you and maybe it's not.  If you are not going to use the income features, though, you may want to reconsider how much you are paying for what is simply being used as a tax advantaged investment vehicle.  There are lower cost options to capture tax advantages (such as the Jefferson National VA mentioned earlier).  In addition, if it is guaranteed lifetime income or pension like income (the real value of annuities) that is of interest to you, then there are possible more efficient and less expensive ways to achieve this such as deferred income annuities, longevity insurance and qualified longevity annuity contracts (QLACs).

Hope this is helpful.

 Low Fee Annuities 
  I get questions periodically about low or no fee annuities.
There are, in fact, annuity products (including variable annuities) that are being developed for fee only financial advisors (advisors who do not accept commissions on product sales).
Some of the companies that have recently developed or are developing these low fee based products include:

Jefferson National
Prudential
Allianz
TIAA-CREF

For more detail see the article that can be viewed by clicking here.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Experts Highlight the Tax Benefits of Annuities 
New York Times -- May 10,2013
While the main goal of an annuity is to provide you with a steady income stream in your retirement, financial experts are starting to highlight the annuity tax benefits these products can provide.
When you purchase an annuity the money grows taxed-deferred which can be a big benefit as many of the favorable tax strategies available are currently under review. Eventually, the money is taxed as ordinary income when you start receiving regular payments from the annuity.
With certain types of annuities (particularly so-called "variable" annuities) fees can eat in to your return and tax benefits when you add options such as guaranteed minimum payout. Surrender fees, which kick in if you take the money out in the first five to 10 years, can also reduce tax benefits. 
No Frills Annuities Have Low Fees
Buying low-fee stripped down annuities is another great tax deferral strategy. These annuities offer no extras and charge low management fees which helps preserve the tax benefits.
A study by Jefferson National Life Insurance Company looked at a variety of assets that were held in tax-deferred accounts and examined at what point the fees charged by these products started to negate the benefits of the tax deferral. They discovered that when the management fees of an annuity go over 1 percent the tax deferment benefits start to fade.
Being unable to access the money in an annuity is a common fear but it tends to be overblown according Jefferson National. As long as you can leave the money in a low fee account for 10 years the amount you have after taxes and penalties would be about equal to the amount you would have if it were invested in a taxable account. 
Purchasing an annuity can be excellent way to provide you with tax deferred income stream in your retirement years.

Jefferson National’s Low Cost Variable Annuity Big Part of Why Nationwide Bought Company

By	
Rachel Summit, with Annuity FYI


in Insurance Companies, Jefferson National, Nationwide, Variable Annuity 
 

Nationwide Financial is planning to greatly expand their variable annuity business through the purchase of Jefferson National, a strong player in the variable annuity game. Investment News’ Christine Idzelis wrote about the acquisition in the article “Nationwide to buy Jefferson National.” This deal gives Nationwide access to Jefferson National’s 4,000 registered investment advisors and fee-based advisors.
It’s a move that Nationwide sees fitting because of the new fiduciary standards that must be met when selling commission-based annuity products. Instead of meeting government suitability requirements, advisors will now have to meet much stricter best interest guidelines when selling commission-based variable and fixed indexed annuities. Nationwide said that this move will help investors and advisors looking to expand fee-based business after the rule takes effect next year.
With a strong brokerage distribution channel already in place, Nationwide says that the expansion of their RIA channel will benefit both themselves and Jefferson National through a partnership that could lead to massive growth. Jefferson National will now be a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide. RIAs are already overseen by the SEC and their advice is held to best interests standards. They offer low-cost variable annuities that Nationwide is excited to start distributing. Nationwide typically works with the broker-dealer distribution channel, so this purchase will really expand their reach in the industry. Jefferson has been dominant in the RIA channel with their line of variable annuities.
The Monument Advisor is Jefferson National’s popular low-cost investment only variable annuity product. It does not have mortality or expense fees and it’s basic contract makes it one of the lowest cost VAs available. There is no surrender penalty, but the product still boasts a large amount of investment options to choose from. It’s been called a very user friendly variable annuity.
RIAs are a fast growing distribution channel because they are mostly fee-based and the new regulations from the DOL are pushing investment business to fee-based models. The broker-dealers that Nationwide usually works with are typically commission-based, a model that some insurers are trying to shift some of their business away from. Nationwide plans to maintain their presence with broker-dealers while increasing their relationship with RIAs and the fee-based channel. Nationwide is counting on Jefferson National’s Monument Advisor variable annuity to be a big part of their business after purchasing the company.

10 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































10 Little-Known Annuity Tips You Should Know   




Tip #1: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation. 





Get My Annuity Report


2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report. 




Tip #2: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. This does not apply to CD-type annuities. 







Tip #4: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund” the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.







Tip #3:  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. There is no free lunch. 







Tip #7: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees. 




Looking for retirement income? Our free report shops 130+ annuities and highlights the companies with the highest guaranteed returns




Compare 1400+ annuities from the two largest annuity databases. Find the highest guaranteed returns 








Tip #5: Annuities with the shortest terms usually have the lowest commissions. Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up. Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.




Tip #6: Diversify.   You don’t want to have all of your savings with 1 insurance company.  It’s wise to diversify and the more you have to invest the more you should diversify. 







Tip #8:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Make sure to get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% pre-tax and you pay 3-4% in fees, you might be better off in fixed products and avoiding market risk.




Tip #9: Shop around. Don't trust the first person you speak to. Find the very best products on the market and look for proof. 




Tip #10:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income riders we can compare 140+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 







Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Sections 9(b) and  9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") against Inviva, Inc. ("Inviva") and Jefferson National Life Insurance Company ("Jefferson National") (together, "Respondents").
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer of Settlement (the "Offer") which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Order"), as set forth below.  

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offer, the Commission finds that:
Overview
1.	From in or about October 2002 through September 2003, Respondents Inviva, a private New York-based insurance holding company, and Jefferson National, an Inviva subsidiary that issued variable annuities, allowed a group of hedge funds and customers of registered representatives to engage in market timing trading on behalf of Jefferson National variable annuity contract owners. 
2.	In October 2002, Inviva purchased Conseco Variable Life Insurance Company ("CVIC") from Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas ("Conseco Life"), an affiliate of Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco").  Among other products, CVIC issued the Monument Series Individual and Group Fixed and Variable Annuity ("Monument") and Advantage Plus Fixed and Variable Annuity ("Advantage Plus") products.  Purchasers of the Monument and Advantage Plus products could invest in mutual fund portfolios managed by various fund complexes.  The prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus products indicated that CVIC reserved the right to take steps to prevent detrimental market timing.  In fact, as of the time Inviva purchased CVIC, CVIC had permitted select clients to purchase Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities for the express purpose of market timing certain unaffiliated mutual fund portfolios.  By October 2002, these clients had invested approximately $100 million in Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities.  Ultimately, market timers invested approximately $120 million in the Monument and Advantage Plus products.
3.	After Inviva's purchase of CVIC, Conseco Services, LLC ("Conseco Services"), a Conseco affiliate, continued to provide services pursuant to a transition services agreement through the end of April 2003, and continued to allow market timing throughout the transition period.  During the transition period, Inviva was aware that CVIC customers were engaged in market timing, and Inviva earned the fees that the variable annuity business generated.  In May 2003, Inviva renamed CVIC as Jefferson National, and took over day-to-day management of the business.  The market timing conduct continued.
4.	As had been the case with CVIC's prospectuses, Jefferson National's prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus products reserved Jefferson National's right to take steps  to prevent detrimental market timing.  Inviva, however, permitted hedge funds and brokerage customers, and registered representatives who traded on their behalf, to continue to engage in market timing through Jefferson National variable annuities.  Through their frequent trading, these market timers diluted the value of the underlying mutual funds that were timed.
Respondents
5.	Inviva, a Delaware corporation, is a privately-held holding company.  Inviva is headquartered in New York, New York, with substantial operations in Louisville, Kentucky.  Inviva purchased the stock of CVIC from Conseco Life in October 2002.  Inviva operates primarily through two subsidiary insurance companies, one of which is Jefferson National.
6.	Jefferson National, the former CVIC, is a life insurance company incorporated in Texas.  Jefferson National is licensed to sell insurance products in forty-nine states and the District of Columbia.  Jefferson National is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Inviva.  Jefferson National served as the depositor of Jefferson National Life Annuity Account G and Jefferson National Life Annuity Account H, which are registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts and are the issuers of the Monument and Advantage Plus products, respectively.  Inviva administers Jefferson National's life and annuity products pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement.
Background
A.	Market Timing
7.	Market timing includes (a) frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because (a) it can dilute the value of their shares, if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies, (b) it can disrupt the management of the mutual fund's investment portfolio, and (c) it can cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate the market timer's frequent buying and selling of shares.
B.	Variable Annuities
8.	Variable annuities are securities.  Variable annuities are insurance contracts that provide for tax-deferred accumulation during the accumulation period and various payout  options, including a series of payments to be made to a person named as the "annuitant" in the contract.  The payments typically come at the annuitant's retirement.  Hedge funds and others that engage in market timing through variable annuities, however, do not purchase the products in order to obtain the retirement income.  Rather, they purchase variable annuities to be able to market time the underlying mutual fund portfolios.
9.	Assets invested in variable annuities are used to purchase securities, and the size of the payments to the annuitant typically depends on the performance of the underlying securities.  Variable annuity products typically offer access to mutual funds.  Contract owners are able to invest in a variety of mutual funds at several mutual fund complexes through subaccounts of the insurance company that hold shares of the funds.  Funds underlying variable annuity products are offered to insurance company separate accounts and certain tax-qualified retirement plans, but are not sold to the general public.  In some cases, the funds are managed similarly to the corresponding retail funds offered by the fund complex.  The insurance company and mutual fund complexes enter into participation agreements.  In general, the annuity contracts allow the contract owner to place securities orders with the insurance company.  Typically, the variable annuity company combines all buy and sell orders for a particular portfolio, and submits a single net order to the mutual fund complex. 
10.	Insurance companies offer their variable annuity products through prospectuses filed with the Commission.  Among other things, the product prospectuses set out the costs of the annuity, the funds offered, and language concerning executing orders.  The prospectuses may also describe the insurance companies' policies on market timing.  The insurance companies deliver the variable annuity prospectuses to prospective purchasers of variable annuity contracts together with the prospectuses for the various mutual funds available for investment.  The fund prospectuses provide additional information on the particular fund, and may include policies about excessive trading or market timing.
11.	As with market timing of mutual funds, market timing through variable annuities can result in increased expense to, and cause dilution in, the underlying mutual fund portfolios.  Thus, market timing through variable annuities can cause harm not only to other variable annuity purchasers at the insurance company that issued the variable annuities, but also to purchasers at other insurance companies invested in the portfolios being timed.
C.	Inviva Facilitated Market Timing
Inviva acquired CVIC
12.	In October 2002, Inviva purchased the stock of CVIC from Conseco Life.  Inviva then began to make arrangements to take over operation of the variable annuity business.  From October 2002 to April 30, 2003, Conseco Services provided various services to help with the transition of the business pursuant to a services contract.
13.	Throughout the transition period, Inviva offered the Monument and Advantage Plus products under the CVIC name, and received all fees from the sale and maintenance of the variable annuity contracts.  Inviva paid certain administrative fees to Conseco Services for administering the business during that time.  The transition was completed concurrently with Jefferson National's filing with the Commission the May 1, 2003 prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuity products.
14.	At the time Inviva acquired CVIC, market timing assets constituted the vast majority of assets invested through the Monument product.  Market timing assets continued to dominate the Monument product, both through the transition period and after Inviva assumed full control of the variable annuity business, until September 2003. 
15.	Inviva and Jefferson National continued to allow market timing in the Monument and Advantage Plus products until approximately September 2003.  After the New York Attorney General's office filed its complaint against Canary Capital LLC in September 2003, market timing contract owners surrendered their contracts and withdrew funds constituting a majority of the assets in the Monument product.
The Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses
16.	The Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuity products made available approximately sixty mutual fund portfolios offered by nineteen different fund complexes, none of which were affiliated with Jefferson National.  Significantly, the Monument product had no surrender fee, which permitted the annuity contract owner to redeem the variable annuity at any time without having to pay a penalty.  In contrast, Advantage Plus had a surrender fee that decreased over time.
17.	During the transition period, the Inviva-owned CVIC issued the Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities pursuant to prospectuses dated May 1, 2002, which had been prepared before Inviva purchased CVIC.  Under a section entitled "Highlights," the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses stated that the product was "intended to be used to accumulate money for retirement or other long-term tax-deferred investment purposes."
18.	The Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses also contained a section entitled "Transfers," which were defined as movements of money between investment options.  This section provided that contract owners were permitted one free transfer between subaccounts per 30-day period.  Further, the Monument prospectus provided that, for any additional transfers, a transfer fee of the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred may be deducted.  Similarly, under a section entitled "Transfer Fee," the Advantage Plus prospectus indicated contract owners might be charged a transfer fee of $25 per transfer for any additional transfers.  In a different section, the Advantage Plus prospectus indicated that a $25 fee may be deducted for additional transfers.
19.	The May 1, 2002 Monument prospectus further stated as follows:
This product is not designed for professional market timing organizations.
[CVIC] reserves the right to modify (including terminating) the
transfer privileges described above.
The May 1, 2002 Advantage Plus prospectus contained substantially similar language.
20.	Finally, the Monument and Advantage Plus May 1, 2002 prospectuses contained a section entitled "Excessive Trading Limits."  This section contained language indicating that CVIC was monitoring excessive trading with a view toward protecting all contract owners' investments.  Specifically, the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses stated the following:
We reserve the right to limit transfers in any Contract year, or to refuse any transfer request for a Contract owner, or third party advisor acting under a Limited Power of Attorney, if:
we believe, in our sole discretion, that excessive trading by the Contract owner, or a specific transfer request, submitted by a third party advisor, or a group of transfer requests, may have a detrimental effect on the accumulation unit values of any subaccount or the share prices of any portfolio or would be detrimental to other Contract owners; or 
we are informed by one or more portfolios that they intend to restrict the purchase of portfolio shares because of excessive trading or because they believe that a specific transfer or group of transfers would have a detrimental effect on the price of portfolio shares.
We may apply the restrictions in any manner reasonably designed to prevent transfers that we consider disadvantageous to other Contract owners.
21.	Starting on May 1, 2003, Inviva and Jefferson National began to issue the Monument and Advantage Plus products under the Jefferson National name, and filed new prospectuses with the Commission.
22.	The May 1, 2003 Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses again contained language that discouraged market timing.  The prospectuses indicated that the products were "not designed for professional market timing organizations" and that Jefferson National reserved "the right to modify" the transfer privileges.  Specifically, the prospectuses contained the following:
Your right to make transfers is subject to modification if we determine,
in our sole opinion, that the exercise of the right by one or more owners is, or
would be, to the disadvantage of other owners.  Restrictions may be applied in
any manner reasonably designed to prevent any use of the transfer right, which is
considered by us to be to the disadvantage of other owners.  A modification could
be applied to transfers to, or from, one or more of the investment portfolios
and could include, but is not limited to:
a.  the requirement of a minimum time period between each transfer;
b.  not accepting a transfer request from an agent acting under a
power of attorney on behalf of more than one owner; or
c.  limiting the dollar amount that may be transferred between
investment portfolios by an owner at any one time.
We reserve the right, at any time, and without prior notice to any
party, to terminate, suspend or modify the transfer privilege during the
accumulation period.
23.	Further, the Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses reiterated the "Excessive Trading Limits" (set forth above) from the CVIC prospectuses.  In addition, the Jefferson National prospectuses identified an additional basis for limiting transfers.  In particular, Jefferson National reserved the right to limit transfers under the following circumstances:
[Y]our transfer request would result in a redemption of a "substantive" amount from an investment portfolio that had been allocated to that portfolio for less than 30 days; "substantive" means a dollar amount that Jefferson National determines, in its sole discretion, could adversely affect the management of the investment portfolio.
24.	Finally, the Jefferson National Monument prospectus indicated (as CVIC's May 1, 2002 prospectus had done) that contract owners were permitted twelve free transfers per year, and that Jefferson National might impose a fee of $25 or 2%, whichever was less, for additional transfers.  The Advantage Plus prospectus indicated that contract owners could make up to twelve transfers per year without charge, and that a $25 transfer fee might be deducted for additional transfers.
25.	The Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose, however, that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers.  Further, the prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy.  In addition, the prospectuses failed to disclose the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.
Inviva facilitated market timing
26.	During the October 2002-May 2003 transition period, two Conseco Services employees introduced Inviva employees to certain of CVIC's market timing customers and brokers, whom the Conseco Services employees referred to as "big ticket" customers.  The Conseco Services employees informed Inviva employees about how to deal with the "big ticket" traders.  The Conseco Services employees gave Inviva employees information identifying both CVIC's market timing customers and the amount of timing capacity available at unaffiliated fund complexes that had permitted timing in their funds.  Inviva did not disclose the existence of the permitted capacity, or its arrangements with funds that permitted market timing, to its other annuitants.
27.	In January 2003, a registered representative at a broker-dealer who represented market timers requested additional market timing capacity for the representative's customers.  An Inviva employee then spoke with a fund representative, who agreed that Inviva could have an additional $10 million in timing capacity.  The registered representative's customers invested the assets, and Inviva agreed to pay the registered representative an "override," or extra commission, of 35 basis points of the value of assets the customers invested.  According to an Inviva employee, the fund representative that had granted the request for additional timing capacity subsequently requested that Inviva add the fund complex's short term bond fund to the Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus mutual fund offerings and thereafter required big ticket customers to keep their timing assets in the short term bond fund when not being used to time other funds.  Doing this had the effect of increasing the fees that the fund complex earned. 
28.	After the transition period, Inviva and Jefferson National allowed the market timing to continue in accordance with the limits CVIC had received from the unaffiliated mutual funds.  Inviva's Director of Sales and Marketing apparently recognized the advantages of managing market timing assets, and suggested obtaining timing capacity at other mutual fund complexes.  A May 19, 2003 e-mail from the director to another Inviva employee indicated that "we should probably put together a list of funds people want to use that won't let us and go tour the fund [companies] explaining how it is a harmless and cheap way to take in some money."
29.	Although the market timers executed significantly more than the permissible number of free transfers, Jefferson National did not exercise the right to impose the transfer fee set out in the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses.  Further, Jefferson National did not make any independent effort to determine whether market timing was harmful to other Jefferson National variable annuity purchasers.
30.	With respect to funds that had not agreed to provide capacity for timing assets, Inviva did not prevent timers from trading in those funds unless the fund complained.  Instead, Jefferson National simply followed the various unaffiliated mutual fund complexes' instructions, including instructions to block trades, when the fund complexes identified a Jefferson National customer as a market timer.  Moreover, Jefferson National did not inform these fund complexes that certain Monument and Advantage Plus customers were executing a market timing strategy.
31.	On March 12, 2003, a Conseco Services employee sent an e-mail to an Inviva employee concerning timers that the Conseco Services employee had identified as having traded in a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity.  The Conseco Services employee asked the Inviva employee to advise the fund complex that CVIC had identified the timers and that CVIC "do[es] not tolerate timers."  Both the Conseco Services and Inviva employees knew, however, that CVIC not only tolerated market timers, but also solicited market timers.
32.	In late April 2003, a representative of a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity, and indeed had previously closed a Europe fund portfolio to CVIC investors due to market timing, sent an e-mail to the same Inviva employee.  In the e-mail, the fund representative confirmed that the fund would reopen the portfolio to Jefferson National investors "based on your 'zero tolerance policy' and procedures you communicated to me with respect to kicking out timers from the products where [the fund's] portfolios are available."  In fact, Jefferson National did not maintain a zero tolerance policy and did not kick timers out of the Monument and Advantage Plus products.
33.	In early May 2003, one of the funds that had agreed to provide capacity for timing assets informed Inviva that the allowed timing capacity in the fund's emerging markets portfolio needed to be reduced from approximately $50 million to $30 million, i.e., a decrease of $20 million.  The Inviva employee that had received the March 12, 2003 e-mail then divided the $30 million in available capacity among certain favored timing clients.  The timers advised the Inviva employee that they intended to invest the $20 million that was no longer permitted in the emerging markets portfolio in other international funds, which had not agreed to provide timing capacity, until additional capacity became available in the emerging markets portfolio.  Although the Inviva employee warned the timers that the international funds might complain if they traded in and out, the employee did not inform these international funds that timers intended to use their funds.
34.	In a May 16, 2003 e-mail, the same Inviva employee asked another Inviva employee whether there was "any way to verify if big dollars are going to the illegal international funds?"  The other Inviva employee replied that "I know there is (sic) a number of timers playing in and out of [a worldwide growth portfolio that had not agreed to provide timing capacity] with moves of $250k or less.  Just enough to stay below the radar."
35.	In August 2003, the Inviva employee who had divided the $30 million in timing capacity learned that there was no more timing capacity in the emerging markets portfolio.  The Inviva employee sent an e-mail on August 13, 2003 to the employee's supervisor, the Director of Sales and Marketing, indicating that the employee had accommodated some of the market timers by allowing them to trade in other international mutual funds that had not agreed to provide timing capacity.  The message concluded as follows: "Since our Int'l [international] funds are sensitive, it's been a bit of a juggle."
Inviva profited from annuity contract owners' market timing
36.	Inviva and Jefferson National earned fees on the Monument and Advantage Plus products while they were allowing market timing.  Inviva earned approximately $1.9 million in fees during the transition period from October 23, 2002 through April 30, 2003, and approximately $2.5 million during the period from May 1, 2003 through November 7, 2003.
Dilution caused by the market timing activity
37.	As a result of the market timing activity in Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities,  the value of annuitants' investments was diluted.
Violations
38.	As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in that Respondents made untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Specifically, the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations, and gave the misleading impression that Respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades.  Further, Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers, that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy, and the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.
39.	As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act in that they made an untrue statement of material fact in a registration statement, application, report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to the Investment Company Act, or omitted to state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being materially misleading.  Specifically, Respondents filed registration statements with the Commission containing prospectuses that falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations, and gave the misleading impression that Respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades.  Further, Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers, that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy, and the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.

The Distribution Plan developed by the Independent Distribution Consultant shall be binding unless, within 130 days after the date of entry of the Order, Respondents or the staff of the Commission advises, in writing, the Independent Distribution Consultant of any determination or calculation from the Distribution Plan that it considers to be inappropriate and states in writing the reasons for considering such determination or calculation inappropriate.
c.	With respect to any determination or calculation with which Respondents or the staff of the Commission do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 160 days of the date of entry of the Order.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents' Offer.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A.	Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the Exchange Act, and Section 9(f) of the Investment Company Act, Inviva and Jefferson National shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act.
B.	Respondents shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III, paragraphs 41 through 45.
C.	Disgorgement and Civil Money Penalties

1.	Respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement in the total amount of $3,500,000 ("Disgorgement") and Jefferson National shall pay civil money penalties in the amount of $1,500,000 ("Penalties"), for a total payment of $5,000,000.
2.	There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair Fund established for the funds described in Section IV.C.1.  Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that they shall not, in any Related Investor Action, benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor's claim by the amount of any Fair Fund distribution to such investor in this proceeding that is proportionately attributable to the civil penalty paid by Respondents ("Penalty Offset").  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such an offset or reduction, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the offset or reduction, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs.  Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed against Respondents in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as those set forth in the Order.
3.	Pursuant to an escrow agreement not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission, Respondents shall, within 175 days of the entry of this Order, pay the Disgorgement and Penalties into an escrow account.  The escrow agreement shall, among other things: (1) require that all funds in escrow be invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed six months;  (2) name an escrow agent who shall be appropriately bonded; and (3) provide that escrowed funds be disbursed only pursuant to an order of the Commission.  Respondents shall be responsible for all costs associated with the escrow agreement.

D.	Other Obligations and Requirements.  Nothing in this Order shall relieve Respondents of any other applicable legal obligation or requirement, including any rule adopted by the Commission subsequent to this Order.

By the Commission.


Jonathan G. Katz
Secretary
