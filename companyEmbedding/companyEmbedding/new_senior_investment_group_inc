Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care. Visit http://www.merrilledge.com/retirement/rollover-ira or call a Merrill Edge rollover specialist at 888.637.3343 for additional information about your choices.
