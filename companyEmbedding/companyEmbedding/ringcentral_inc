RingCentral CEO Vlad Shmunis founded the company in 1999.[12][13] RingCentral investors included Doug Leone, Sequoia Capital, David Weiden, Khosla Ventures, Rob Theis, Scale Venture Partners, Bobby Yerramilli-Rao, Hermes Growth Partners and DAG Ventures.[9][14][15] It completed its IPO in 2013.[16][17]

History[edit]
RingCentral was bootstrapped until it received its first round of venture capital investment in 2006.[11] In 2011, RingCentral added Cisco and Silicon Valley Bank as investors and had, to date, secured a total of $45 million in capital investment.[18]
On September 27, 2013, RingCentral completed its IPO.[16][17] The company completed a follow-on offering in March 2014 worth 7.5 million.[19]
Products[edit]
RingCentral's flagship product is RingCentral Office. The company also offers RingCentral Professional, and RingCentral Fax.[20][21]
RingCentral provides a cloud-based business phone system. It offers PBX features such as multiple extensions; call control; Outlook, Salesforce, Google Docs, DropBox and Box integration; SMS; video conferencing and web conferencing; fax; auto-receptionist; call logs; and rule-based call routing and answering.[5][21][22] Customers do not require capital investment or maintenance contracts, which lowers customer costs and – as with most cloud-based technologies -- "potentially disrupts" traditional on-premises PBX providers.[23]
RingCentral Office[edit]
RingCentral Office is a cloud-based PBX system for businesses.[22] RingCentral Office features include call auto-attendant, company directory, call forwarding and handling, multiple extensions, a mobile app for iPhone and Android, Business SMS, video conferencing and screen-sharing, and fax.[22]
RingCentral Professional[edit]
RingCentral Professional is a suite that provides a universal telephone number, voice mail, dial-by-name directory, call-forwarding, and other features through a smartphone app on iPhone and Android devices.[15][24]
RingCentral Fax[edit]
RingCentral Fax allows users to send and receive faxes through the Internet without a fax machine.[25][26] The service integrates with Dropbox, Box, and Google Docs.[25]
RingCentral Contact Center[edit]
RingCentral Contact Center is a full-featured contact center product, formed via a partnership with inContact.[27] It offers real-time reporting and dashboards, historical reporting, multichannel capabilities, supervisory capabilities, an IVR, and numerous other functions necessary to the operation of a contact center.
Glip[edit]
In June 2015, RingCentral acquired Glip.[28] Glip is a persistent collaboration platform which adds instant messaging, document sharing, task and event management, and other collaboration functionality to the RingCentral platform. Glip was acquired by RingCentral for an undisclosed amount.[29]
Awards[edit]
RingCentral was identified as one of Forbes’ 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for 2016 and 2017. [30] [31] In 2016, RingCentral was selected to Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™ for the third consecutive year. [32] The Deloitte Technology Fast 500 is a ranking of the 500 fastest-growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies in North America. [33]
For its strong overall performance, RingCentral earned Frost & Sullivan’s 2016 Company of the Year Award. [34] The company is recognized as a 2017 PC Magazine Editor’s Choice.[35] According to PC Magazine, RingCentral is extremely versatile and can be configured to fit practically any kind of business.[36]

History[edit]
RingCentral was bootstrapped until it received its first round of venture capital investment in 2006.[11] In 2011, RingCentral added Cisco and Silicon Valley Bank as investors and had, to date, secured a total of $45 million in capital investment.[18]
On September 27, 2013, RingCentral completed its IPO.[16][17] The company completed a follow-on offering in March 2014 worth 7.5 million.[19]
Products[edit]
RingCentral's flagship product is RingCentral Office. The company also offers RingCentral Professional, and RingCentral Fax.[20][21]
RingCentral provides a cloud-based business phone system. It offers PBX features such as multiple extensions; call control; Outlook, Salesforce, Google Docs, DropBox and Box integration; SMS; video conferencing and web conferencing; fax; auto-receptionist; call logs; and rule-based call routing and answering.[5][21][22] Customers do not require capital investment or maintenance contracts, which lowers customer costs and – as with most cloud-based technologies -- "potentially disrupts" traditional on-premises PBX providers.[23]
RingCentral Office[edit]
RingCentral Office is a cloud-based PBX system for businesses.[22] RingCentral Office features include call auto-attendant, company directory, call forwarding and handling, multiple extensions, a mobile app for iPhone and Android, Business SMS, video conferencing and screen-sharing, and fax.[22]
RingCentral Professional[edit]
RingCentral Professional is a suite that provides a universal telephone number, voice mail, dial-by-name directory, call-forwarding, and other features through a smartphone app on iPhone and Android devices.[15][24]
RingCentral Fax[edit]
RingCentral Fax allows users to send and receive faxes through the Internet without a fax machine.[25][26] The service integrates with Dropbox, Box, and Google Docs.[25]
RingCentral Contact Center[edit]
RingCentral Contact Center is a full-featured contact center product, formed via a partnership with inContact.[27] It offers real-time reporting and dashboards, historical reporting, multichannel capabilities, supervisory capabilities, an IVR, and numerous other functions necessary to the operation of a contact center.
Glip[edit]
In June 2015, RingCentral acquired Glip.[28] Glip is a persistent collaboration platform which adds instant messaging, document sharing, task and event management, and other collaboration functionality to the RingCentral platform. Glip was acquired by RingCentral for an undisclosed amount.[29]
Awards[edit]
RingCentral was identified as one of Forbes’ 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for 2016 and 2017. [30] [31] In 2016, RingCentral was selected to Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™ for the third consecutive year. [32] The Deloitte Technology Fast 500 is a ranking of the 500 fastest-growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies in North America. [33]
For its strong overall performance, RingCentral earned Frost & Sullivan’s 2016 Company of the Year Award. [34] The company is recognized as a 2017 PC Magazine Editor’s Choice.[35] According to PC Magazine, RingCentral is extremely versatile and can be configured to fit practically any kind of business.[36]
RingCentral earned TMC’s 2017 WebRTC Product of the Year Award[37]. This award honors solutions that support browser-to-browser applications for voice calling, video chat, and P2P file sharing without the need of either internal or external plug-ins. It has also been recognized in TMC’s 2017 Unified Communications Product of the Year Award that honors the best, most innovative unified communications products and solutions released in the last twelve months. [38]
In 2017, RingCentral was named to the Constellation Research’s Enterprise Group Messaging: Standalone[39] and Enterprise Group Messaging: Unified Communication[40] shortlists. Other 2017 awards include the TMC's 2016 Unified Communications Excellence Award [41] and the Silver Stevie® Award for Customer Service Department of the Year [42]
Industry Accolades[edit]
Gartner positioned RingCentral as a leader in its "2016 Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), Worldwide" as a result of its ability to execute and the completeness of vision. [43] IHS Markit has identified RingCentral as a leader in its 2017 UCaaS Scorecard [44] Also in 2017, Aragon Research recognized the company as a leader in Unified Communications and Collaboration [45]

History[edit]
RingCentral was bootstrapped until it received its first round of venture capital investment in 2006.[11] In 2011, RingCentral added Cisco and Silicon Valley Bank as investors and had, to date, secured a total of $45 million in capital investment.[18]
On September 27, 2013, RingCentral completed its IPO.[16][17] The company completed a follow-on offering in March 2014 worth 7.5 million.[19]
Products[edit]
RingCentral's flagship product is RingCentral Office. The company also offers RingCentral Professional, and RingCentral Fax.[20][21]
RingCentral provides a cloud-based business phone system. It offers PBX features such as multiple extensions; call control; Outlook, Salesforce, Google Docs, DropBox and Box integration; SMS; video conferencing and web conferencing; fax; auto-receptionist; call logs; and rule-based call routing and answering.[5][21][22] Customers do not require capital investment or maintenance contracts, which lowers customer costs and – as with most cloud-based technologies -- "potentially disrupts" traditional on-premises PBX providers.[23]

In addition, prices exclude any copyright levies, waste and environment fees and similar charges that RingCentral by law or statute may charge or collect upon in accordance with such laws or statutes.
Customer will be responsible for any sales, uses, excise, value added, services, consumption, and other taxes and duties payable by Customer on any Products purchased by Customer where the tax is imposed on Customer’s acquisition or use of such Products and the amount of tax is measured by Customer’s costs in acquiring such goods or services.  Customer shall make all payments of any such taxes to RingCentral without reduction for any withholding taxes, which shall be Customer’s sole responsibility.  All taxes shall be paid by Customer to RingCentral unless Customer provides RingCentral with a valid certificate of exemption acceptable to the appropriate taxing authority.

6. Invoicing and Payment.

Customer shall pay the purchase price, without any deduction or set-off, within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice which shall be issued to Customer on the date that Products are shipped.  Invoices shall be issued by RingCentral to Customer upon delivery of the  Products in accordance with Section 7.
Customer shall make payment to RingCentral in the currency indicated on the invoice.
All express deliveries may be subject to additional shipping charges regardless of invoice value.
If: (i) Customer fails to make any payment under any Contract when due; (ii) Customer is a body corporate and any resolution or petition to wind up Customer’s business (other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction) is passed or presented; or (iii) Customer is an individual or a partnership, and any grounds arise for the application for a bankruptcy order made under applicable bankruptcy and/or insolvency laws (an “Act of Bankruptcy”), then, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to RingCentral, the full price of all Products delivered to Customer under any Contract, but not paid, shall become immediately due (notwithstanding any previously agreed credit terms) and RingCentral may take any or all of the following courses of action:
by notice, suspend or terminate any Contract or any part thereof, without liability, stop any Products in transit and, at its discretion, subject to Section 8, enter Customer’s premises to recover Products for which payment has not been made in full;
charge Customer interest, both pre- and post judgment, on any unpaid amount past due, at the rate of 2.5% per month, or the maximum rate allowed by law, until full payment is made.  For clarity, a part of a month shall be treated as a full month for the purpose of calculating interest;
set-off any amounts due against any credit note, balance or other liability issued by RingCentral to Customer;
appropriate any payment made by Customer for such Products  as RingCentral may deem fit (notwithstanding any purported appropriation by Customer); and/or
alter Customer’s payment terms, which may include withdrawing or altering any credit limit previously granted, requiring prepayment, and demanding adequate assurance of due performance by Customer through the provision of a bank guarantee.



7. Delivery, Risk of Loss, and Title
Customer agrees that all deliveries of Products (including deliveries after repair or replacement) will be made as follows:

Delivery. Unless RingCentral provides Customer with express written confirmation of a different delivery term, all deliveries of Products will be made FCA (INCOTERMS 2010) at the delivery point specified by RingCentral. Notwithstanding the agreed delivery term, RingCentral may charge Customer for shipping and handling charges, which may be reflected as a separate line item on RingCentral's invoice.
Title and Risk of Loss. Title and Risk of Loss to all Products will pass to Customer when the Products are transferred to a carrier at RingCentral´s designated shipping location. Title to Software provided under this Agreement will remain solely with RingCentral and its licensors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Customer fail to pay RingCentral for Products within thirty (30) days of shipment, Title may, in RingCentral’s sole discretion revert back to RingCentral upon written notice to Customer.
Any dates quoted for delivery of the Products are approximate only and RingCentral shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of the Products however caused.  Any Products may be delivered by RingCentral in advance of the quoted delivery date upon giving reasonable notice to Customer.
If the destination of the Products is not in the same country as RingCentral’s designated shipping location, RingCentral may arrange on behalf of the Customer, for its shipping vendor to deliver the Products in the destination country. The foregoing in the understanding that: i) the shipment of the Products to the destination country is permitted by RingCentral, its Supplier, OEMs, and applicable regulations; ii) the delivery term will remain FCA (Incoterm 2010) RingCentral’s  designated shipping point; iii) Customer remains responsible for all charges as described in Section  5(a); iv)  RingCentral shipping agent accepts to manage the exportation and importation of the Products for the Customer; and, v) Customer will remain responsible for import and export regulations and compliance with applicable laws, including without limitation Section 15 Compliance with Laws of these terms
Claims for non-delivery of Products must be made in writing to RingCentral within five (5) working days from: (i) the date of invoice; or (ii) receipt of partial delivered of the Products, if any.  Customer agrees to notify RingCentral promptly in the event Customer receives the invoice prior to receipt of the Products.
Customer agrees to accept partial delivery of Products ordered unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing.  Where the parties agree in writing that a shipment must be sent complete, Customer agrees to accept allocations of Product in the event of shortage by Supplier.  Where the Products are delivered in installments, each delivery shall constitute a separate Contract.  Failure by RingCentral to deliver any one or more of the installments in accordance with these Conditions or any claim by Customer in respect of any one or more instalments shall not entitle Customer to treat a Contract as repudiated or to cancel any other instalment.
If Customer fails to take delivery of the Products within 48 hours after the scheduled date of shipment, or fails to give RingCentral adequate delivery instructions in its Purchase Order, then, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available, RingCentral may: (i) store the Products until actual delivery and charge Customer for the reasonable costs thereof, including insurance costs; (ii) terminate the Contract forthwith and sell the Products; or iii)  ship the Products by a freight forwarder to Customer´s business location business location indicated in the correspondent purchase order with Customer remaining responsible for all reasonable freight and insurance costs.  Title and Risk of Loss will pass when the Products are transferred to the freight forwarder at RingCentral´s, or its Supplier’s, designated shipping location.
Customer shall bear any and all costs (including original and return carriage costs) associated with any unjustified refusal of delivery of Products ordered pursuant to a Contract.
Customer’s right to possess any Products, for which payment has not made shall immediately cease: (i) after the appointment of a receiver to its property; (ii) after it has been placed in liquidation or administration; (iii) when and if Customer makes an arrangement for the benefit of creditors generally, suffers or permits the appointment of an administrator, administrative receiver or receiver for its business or assets, or avails itself or becomes subject to any proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy laws; (iv) if Customer is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws; (v) if Customer, not being a company, has become bankrupt; or (vi) if Customer otherwise ceases to trade or threatens to cease to trade.

8. Publications & Specifications.

Any and all specifications, descriptions, photographs, measurements, capacities or illustrations contained in any catalogues, price lists, brochures, leaflets, proposals, advertising matter, publications of RingCentral or a Supplier are intended to be illustrative and approximate only and shall not form part of a Contract or constitute a representation, warranty or condition regarding any Products unless specifically agreed by written agreement between the Customer and RingCentral.  No employee or agent of RingCentral (or any entity acting on RingCentral’s behalf) has any authority to make any representation regarding the Products.  Customer acknowledges that it has not been induced to accept these Conditions by any representations or statement, oral or written, not expressly contained herein.

9. Warranty.

Customer understands that RingCentral is not the Supplier of the Products.  Accordingly, all Products are sold subject to the express warranty terms, if any, specified by the original Supplier of the Products.  Any software supplied to Customer pursuant to a Contract is supplied subject to the provisions of the Supplier’s licensing terms. RingCentral will pass through to Customer all warranties that RingCentral is expressly authorized by the original Supplier to pass through to Customer.
RingCentral represents and warrants that title to all Products shall be free from all security interests, liens, and encumbrances at the time of delivery to Customer.  The foregoing shall not be construed, and RingCentral does not provide, any warranty against infringement of a third-party intellectual property right.  Any warranties, conditions or other terms implied by common law or statute or otherwise in connection with these Conditions (except to title, in the case of Products) are hereby expressly excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law, save for fraudulent misrepresentation.

10. Warranty Assistance.

For all Returned Products (whether pursuant to a Warranty Claim or otherwise) RingCentral will, on the Customer’s behalf, initiate an RMA request with Supplier.  Following an RMA request, RingCentral shall issue an RMA number and issue a shipping label to Customer via electronic exchange (an “RMA”).
Customer shall immediately notify RingCentral if any Products supplied to Customer prove to be defective in quality or condition within the Supplier’s warranty period (the “Claim”).  Upon receipt of notification of such Claim, RingCentral shall notify Customer whether, as a matter of Supplier policy, the Claim must be handled directly with the Supplier or indirectly through RingCentral.  In the event the Claim must be handled directly between Customer and Supplier, RingCentral shall provide contact information to enable Customer to contact Supplier.  In the event the Claim will be handled by RingCentral, then RingCentral shall provide Customer with a return material authorization (“RMA”) for Customer to return the Products to RingCentral, and Customer shall return such Products to RingCentral in accordance with these Conditions and RingCentral’s then current RMA policy (which shall be made available to Customer upon request).
No Products may be returned to RingCentral without a valid RMA number displayed on the Products packaging.   Any Products returned without a valid RMA number displayed on the Products packaging will be refused or returned.  RingCentral shall not be obligated to ship replacement Products to Customer until RingCentral is in receipt of the original Products being returned.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon receipt of notification of any warranty claim within the first ninety (90) days after receipt of the Product by Customer, RingCentral shall process such warranty claim per Supplier procedures and ensure the shipment of a replacement Product to Customer.  Replacement Product may be new or used.  After the first ninety (90) days from receipt of the Product by Customer, and unless otherwise directed by RingCentral, the Customer must contact the Supplier directly for any warranty repair or replacement services.
During the first ninety (90) days after Customer’s receipt of the Product, RingCentral is responsible for all shipping fees associated with a warranty claim (including, without limitation, both return of the defective Product and shipment of the replacement Product).  Customer shall be responsible for any such shipping costs for warranty claims made after such initial ninety (90) day period.
Customer agrees that RingCentral’s sole liability to Customer regarding any Product defect claims is limited to the administration of such claims with the Supplier, and as set forth herein.  After the first ninety (90) days from Customer’s receipt of Product, RingCentral’s liability to Customer regarding any Product defect claims is limited to and is expressly contingent upon RingCentral’s ability to obtain a refund, credit or replacement Products from the Supplier.  RingCentral has no obligation to accept a return of Products where the Customer fails to comply with Supplier’s policy on Product returns.
RingCentral shall not be liable or responsible for administering any defect or other claim which arises from normal wear and tear, misuse, negligence, accident, abuse, use not in accordance with Supplier’s Product documentation, modification or alteration not authorised by Supplier, or use in conjunction with a third party product.  RingCentral reserves the right to determine whether any Products are defective.

11. Warranty Returns.

Any Products returned pursuant to an RMA issued by RingCentral must be shipped to RingCentral within seven (7) working days of the date of such RMA.  Following an RMA request, RingCentral shall issue an RMA number and issue a shipping label to Customer via electronic exchange.
Customer irrevocably authorizes RingCentral to carry out any necessary tasks related to the repair or replacement of Products on behalf of Customer under these Conditions.
Unless RingCentral collects Products using its own carrier, Customer agrees that RingCentral shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Products returned to RingCentral.

12. Limitation of Liability.

RINGCENTRAL’S LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT THESE CONDITIONS AND ANY CONTRACT FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS HEREUNDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO, AND SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE PRODUCTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (EXCLUDING APPLICABLE TAXES). RINGCENTRAL SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OR ANY CONTRACT IF RINGCENTRAL HAS NOT RECEIVED PAYMENT OF THE TOTAL INVOICE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE CONDITIONS, RINGCENTRAL AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY FINANCIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED TO CUSTOMER BY REASON OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED), CONDITION OR OTHER TERM, OR ANY DUTY AT COMMON LAW; OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, RECORDS OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR GOODWILL, OR ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL) OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION HOWEVER CAUSED (WHETHER CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF RINGCENTRAL, ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR OTHERWISE) WHICH ARISE OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE CONDITIONS OR A CONTRACT HEREUNDER, EVEN IF RINGCENTRAL OR ITS SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, LIABILITY OR DAMAGES.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as excluding or limiting RingCentral’s liability for death or personal injury caused by RingCentral’s negligence, or wilful misconduct.

13. Intellectual Property Rights.

Customer acknowledges that the Products are the intellectual property of the Suppliers and, to the extent any logos, copyrights, trademarks, or similar intellectual property of RingCentral or its partners are affixed to Products, RingCentral or its partners, as applicable.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to grant any right or title to such intellectual property to Customer.  Customer further agrees not to translate, reverse compile or disassemble any software.  Customer will not remove, alter or destroy any form of copyright notice, proprietary markings, serial numbers, or confidential legends placed upon or contained within any Products.
Customer understands and agrees that RingCentral will not and has no duty to indemnify, defend or hold Customer or a third party harmless from or against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, judgments or settlement amounts arising out of or in connection with the actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights, except and only to the extent that a Supplier has expressly agreed to offer such indemnification and defense to Customer on a pass through basis.  In addition, RingCentral will pass through to Customer all indemnities made available by Supplier that Supplier has expressly authorized RingCentral to pass through to Customer.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as authorizing or granting to Customer any right or license to use any logo, trademark or trade name of RingCentral, or any Supplier, any license of which shall be subject to separate agreement including any then current policies of RingCentral, or its Suppliers, as appropriate.

14. Force Majeure.

Neither party shall be liable to the other party or be deemed in breach of these Conditions or any Contract by reason of delay or failure to perform if such delay or failure to perform was caused by Force Majeure.
In the event of a Force Majeure event: (i) the party claiming Force Majeure shall, as soon as commercially practicable, notify the other party of such Force Majeure event provided the notifying party shall incur no liability for its failure to give such notice; (ii) the notifying party’s duty to perform shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure event; and (iii) the time of performance for the party impacted by the Force Majeure event shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of said Force Majeure event.
In the event a Force Majeure event should continue for more than ninety (90) days, either party may, by written notice to the other, cancel a Contract insofar as Products remain undelivered under said Contract.  Upon such cancellation, RingCental shall have no obligation to deliver and Customer will have no obligation to accept delivery of or pay for the undelivered Products, but the Contract shall remain in full force and effect regarding all Products delivered prior to the date of cancellation.

15. Compliance with Laws; Export.

Customer acknowledges that the Products and any technical data related thereto is licensed or sold subject to and controlled by the export laws of: (i) the United States (“US”) including its Export Administration Regulations; (ii) the European Union (“EU”) and countries within the European Free Trade Area (“EFTA”); and (iii) any other government with jurisdiction (collectively the “Export Control Laws”) and Customer hereby agrees not to export, re-export or otherwise distribute Products, or direct products thereof, in violation of any Export Control Laws.  Customer acknowledges that the US government and/or the member states of the EU and EFTA, or another country’s government, may require licensing or other authorisation prior to export.
Customer warrants that it will not export or re-export any Products with knowledge that they will be used in the design, development, production, or use of chemical, biological, nuclear, or ballistic weapons, or in a facility engaged in such activities, unless Customer has obtained prior written approval from the appropriate department of the US Government or any other government with jurisdiction.  Customer further warrants that it will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, any Products to embargoed countries or sell Products to prohibited companies or individuals, as defined by applicable Export Control Laws.
