Goes Public Through Reverse Merger With Wiless Controls Inc.MarketwiredMay 19, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareMONTREAL, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - May 19, 2014) -  Wiless Controls Inc. (WILS) is pleased to announce that it has concluded a reverse merger agreement with Crio Inc.(http://www.criobru.com/) of Lindon, UT. Under the terms of the agreement, Crio Inc. will acquire 75% of the Company's outstanding equity through a share exchange, as well as gain operational control of the Company. Wiless will spin-off its past operations in order for Crio to be able to concentrate on its business plan."Access to the public market will completely change the dynamic of our company," said Nick Hanson, Crio Chairman and Co-CEO. "Although Crio has grown exponentially since its inception just a few of years ago, it has done so strictly with internal funds and its own cash flow. Easier access to capital should push our growth to new heights, enabling us to fill the existing demand and accelerate our marketing push.""This change of control will give our shareholders access to the reward that we no longer could foresee with our former business plan," said Michel St-Pierre, CEO of Wiless. "Crio's acclaimed product, its past record of growth and the quality of its management all but assures us that."About Crio Inc.Crio Inc. was built around a revolutionary new product created by Dr. Eric Durtschi - brewed cocoa - globally recognized as a healthy alternative to coffee. Crio is the first company to introduce brewed cocoa to traditional retail channels - grocery stores, coffee shops, online stores - and has established wholesale and distributor relationships worldwide. Crio looks to capitalize on the untapped market of brewed cocoa and its other products, as the first alternative to coffee and tea in the $62 Billion U.S. market.Mission Statement Crio Inc., a Utah corporation incorporated on October 12, 2010, was formed to exploit innovations to the cocoa brewing process developed by its founders and to create and develop a market for a healthy alternative beverage to coffee and tea.FORWARD-LOOKING-STATEMENT: Except for factual statements made herein, the information contained in this press release consists of forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including the effect of changing economic conditions, competition within the credit and security industry, customer acceptance of products and other risks and uncertainties.

Crio Inc.


        Crio Bru is 100% cocoa that brews like coffee.  It is the first product of its kind to market, developed by Eric Durtschi, a founder and officer of Crio Inc.  Crio Beans are organic cocoa beans that have been hand-washed, roasted and covered in a fine dark chocolate.  Crio is only one of two companies in the United States to produce a similar product. Crio plans to launch additional product lines this year-Crio Cocoa Shell Tea, Crio Espresso, Crio Gourmet Hot Coca Mix, etc.
    

From the 42nd Winter Fancy Food Show 2017
                 (booth 700)

Crio Bru Brewed Cocoa


                Tags:
                
                Beverages :: Hot Beverages

Crio Bru is made from a single ingredient—roasted and ground cocoa beans.  Our proprietary harvesting techniques and perfected roasting levels preserve the innate nutritional profile of our beans while unlocking intense and complex flavors.  Crio Bru is brewed like coffee resulting in a healthy, rich, dark chocolate drink that naturally has 0 fat, 0 sugars, just 10 calories, and up to 4x the antioxidants of coffee per 8-oz. serving. Oh, and it’s delicious!

ABOUT THE PRODUCER

                            702-808-4845


Crio Bru is 100% cocoa that brews like coffee.  It is the first product of its kind to market, developed by Eric Durtschi, a founder and officer of Crio Inc.

HONEST ENERGY™
Try it, and you’ll be a believer!











What is Honest Energy™
The natural energy boost you get with a cup of Crio Bru comes honestly, without the discomfort or even harmful effects you may experience with caffeine. Our superior coffee alternative is made with 100% Fair Trade cacao beans, roasted and ground using a proprietary process that preserves many of its plentiful health benefits.
Contrary to what some people believe, cocoa contains little to no caffeine; instead it has theobromine, a natural and gentle stimulant relative to caffeine. Unlike caffeine – which is harsh with a spike and following crash – theobromine works with your body, not against it, giving you a mild, long-lasting lift without making you feel nervous or jittery.


As part of a healthy diet, Crio Bru gives you healthy Honest Energy™ that keeps you feeling great all day.

Try it Today!



But that’s not all. Cacao is 100% gluten free, dairy free, cholesterol free, soy free, sodium free and sugar free. It’s one of nature’s most amazing superfoods, providing not only natural energy, but high antioxidant value, mineral benefits and more*.


Boosts your immune system
Cacao contains the highest concentration of antioxidants of any food in the world; by weight it has more antioxidants than red wine, blueberries, açai, pomegranates, and goji berries combined!
Promotes weight loss
Low in calories, fat and carbs – and with theobromine as a natural appetite suppressant – cacao is the superfood that helps curb your appetite while promoting weight loss and healthy living.
Rich in Magnesium and other minerals
Cacao has high levels of magnesium, zinc, and other minerals supporting the heart, aiding digestion, building strong bones and healthy blood.
Supports brain and body chemistry
Cacao is abundant in chemicals produced by the body but rarely found in most foods:

Anadamide, an endorphin or “bliss chemical” produced after exercise
Phenylethylamine for increased focus and alertness
Serotonin, a primary neurotransmitter that helps build a “stress defense shield”
Tryptophan, an amino acid that enhances relaxation and promotes better sleep

Goes Public Through Reverse Merger With Wiless Controls Inc.MarketwiredMay 19, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareMONTREAL, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - May 19, 2014) -  Wiless Controls Inc. (WILS) is pleased to announce that it has concluded a reverse merger agreement with Crio Inc.(http://www.criobru.com/) of Lindon, UT. Under the terms of the agreement, Crio Inc. will acquire 75% of the Company's outstanding equity through a share exchange, as well as gain operational control of the Company. Wiless will spin-off its past operations in order for Crio to be able to concentrate on its business plan."Access to the public market will completely change the dynamic of our company," said Nick Hanson, Crio Chairman and Co-CEO. "Although Crio has grown exponentially since its inception just a few of years ago, it has done so strictly with internal funds and its own cash flow. Easier access to capital should push our growth to new heights, enabling us to fill the existing demand and accelerate our marketing push.""This change of control will give our shareholders access to the reward that we no longer could foresee with our former business plan," said Michel St-Pierre, CEO of Wiless. "Crio's acclaimed product, its past record of growth and the quality of its management all but assures us that."About Crio Inc.Crio Inc. was built around a revolutionary new product created by Dr. Eric Durtschi - brewed cocoa - globally recognized as a healthy alternative to coffee.

Crio looks to capitalize on the untapped market of brewed cocoa and its other products, as the first alternative to coffee and tea in the $62 Billion U.S. market.Mission Statement Crio Inc., a Utah corporation incorporated on October 12, 2010, was formed to exploit innovations to the cocoa brewing process developed by its founders and to create and develop a market for a healthy alternative beverage to coffee and tea.FORWARD-LOOKING-STATEMENT: Except for factual statements made herein, the information contained in this press release consists of forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including the effect of changing economic conditions, competition within the credit and security industry, customer acceptance of products and other risks and uncertainties.

About Us
CREATIVE, COMMITTED, HONEST!









Crio, Inc. was founded in 2010 by Dr. Eric Durtschi, an insightful entrepreneur who wanted to share his discovery of brewed cocoa beans as a healthy and delicious alternative to coffee.
Named after the famed criollo cocoa beans, Crio’s flagship product is Crio Bru, 100% roasted and ground cocoa beans that are brewed like coffee. The inspiration for this drink originated thousands of years ago by the indigenous peoples of Central and South America. It was served to kings and prized for its energizing and restorative properties. In more recent times it has been supplanted by coffee but as we realize the many negatives of caffeine, the search for a new, healthier drink began. Crio Bru is the original hot drink of kings and is now available for everyone.
Dr. Durtschi travels the world to locate the finest cacao plantations producing the smoothest, most flavorful beans. He is also the inventor of a new roaster and grinder design that optimizes the brewing process to produce a consistently great cup of Crio. Now that’s commitment you can believe in!

FAQs
Learn More about Crio Bru












WHAT IS CRIO BRU?
Crio Bru is the 100% natural, 100% pure, 100% incredible drink made from 100% cacao beans, roasted and ground to perfection and brewed just like coffee. Named after the Criollo – the most prized of cacao beans – Crio Bru will delight you with its complex chocolatey flavors, subtle aromas and balanced, antioxidant-rich health benefits!
Both new and ancient, Ka’kao was an everyday drink of the indigenous peoples of Central and South America for centuries – the great Incas, Mayans, Olmecs and Aztecs. And now its incredible health properties have been rediscovered for life today.


FAQ
How do I brew it?
Crio Bru is made any way that traditional coffee is brewed. You can make it in a standard auto-drip machine with a permanent gold filter (not paper), or in a French Press. To brew a strong cup of Crio, think hotter and longer. Set your auto-drip to brew slowly or brew it 10-12 minutes in a French Press with boiling water. Drink it “black” with nothing added or experiment with your favorite creamer and sweetener. Feeling adventurous? Try a dash of cinnamon, or even mix it with ground coffee to make an incredible Crio Mocha.


What are the health benefits of Crio Bru?
Enabling you to lead a healthier and happier life, Crio Bru is the ultimate superfood. It is low in calories and contains no sugar, no fat, no dairy, no sodium, no gluten, no soy, no cholesterol and practically no caffeine, while being extremely high in antioxidants, theobromine, magnesium and a host of other vitamins, amino acids and minerals. Doctors and dieticians have told us about the benefits of dark chocolate for years, and now Crio Bru has emerged as an exciting, healthy new way to enjoy them every day.
The natural, non-addictive energy boost you get from drinking Crio is a product not of caffeine (a common misconception), but from theobromine, an amazing compound that provides focused, mild, long-lasting energy, as well as acting as a natural appetite suppressant and fat blocker for those trying to lose weight. After a cup of Crio in the morning, you’ll feel great all day, without caffeine’s “jitters and crash” effects.

How else can I enjoy Crio Bru?

Drink it as a low calorie snack to curb your appetite
Blend with your favorite coffee to reduce acidity and caffeine
Try it over ice for a cool summer drink
Add it to desserts and recipes
Relax with a hot cup of crio at night without fear of sleeplessness


Can I reuse the grounds?
Yes, similar to coffee grounds, Crio Bru grounds make great compost; they contain iron and magnesium that make a good additive to your soil. However, please ensure that pets don’t get into the soil, as it could be very harmful or even fatal.  Crio Bru is chocolate, which contains theobromine & is toxic to dogs.
Crio Bru grounds also make an excellent skin exfoliant. Or add them to shakes or your favorite recipes for added nutrition and fiber!
