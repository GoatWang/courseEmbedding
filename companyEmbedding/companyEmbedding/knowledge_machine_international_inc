(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. 
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. 

The figures above represent only estimated costs. 

Our offering expenses of approximately $7,000 are comprised primarily of legal
and accounting expenses, publishing/Edgarization fees, SEC filing fees and
transfer agent fees. Our officers and directors will not receive any
compensation for their efforts in selling our shares.
 
If we are able to sell only 1,500,000, shares (75% of this offering) we can
maintain our reporting requirements with the SEC and complete the development of
our business to distribute High End Cutlery Sets, with the exception that we
will have insufficient funds to hire a sales person. If we are not able to sell
a minimum of 500,000 shares (25% of this offering), we will not implement our
business plan at all, except maintaining our reporting with the SEC and remain
in good standing with the state of Nevada. If we do not sell at least 500,000
shares (25% of this offering) we will not be able to maintain our reporting
status with the SEC, remain in good standing with the state of Nevada and
complete most of our website development. If we are unable to complete the
Maximum Offering of 2,000,000 shares, we will attempt to raised the funds needed
to complete our Plan of Operation through equity financing, debt financing, or
other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website
www.songbirddevelopment.com are greater than we have budgeted. Our website is
currently in the process of development. We will also require additional
financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning
revenues.
 
We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following
this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing
when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further
financing, the successful development of our High End Cutlery Sets products
business, a successful marketing and promotion program, and achieving a
profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by
us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be
available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are
no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our
continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be
available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated
sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional
financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.

If we are successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares of common stock under this
Offering, the net proceeds will be used for our business plan and general
working capital, during the twelve months following the successful completion of
this Offering. In all instances, after the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will require some amount of
working capital to maintain our basic operations and comply with our public
reporting obligations. In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of
the amount of proceeds received, we may change the use of proceeds because of
changes in our business plan. Investors should understand that we have wide
discretion over the use of proceeds.


There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales
companies selling High End Cutlery Sets products. We expect to face medium to
high level of resistance when we enter the market, where it will be up to our
marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Most of our
competitors have greater financial resources and may be able to withstand sales
or price decreases well than we can. We also expect to continue to face
competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete
effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
High End Cutlery Sets are distributed by many companies as well as numerous
stores and websites in Europe and North America. To compete with other
companies, we plan is to use helpful customer service and offer a wide
assortment of High End Cutlery Sets at competitive prices. We will take
significant efforts to promote our product using marketing and internet tools.


Company Description
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 27, 2012 to 
engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the 
distribution of high end cutlery sets produced in China. 
---

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute high end cutlery
sets of


 different types: stainless steel cutlery, ceramic cutlery, etc. made in
China. We entered into the Agreements with Chinese manufacturers ADA KITCHENWARE
INDUSTRIAL & TRADING CO., LTD and also with KITCHENSMITH CO., LTD., who will 
supply the high end cutlery sets products to our company. We currently have 
$45,830 in revenues, a limited operating history, and have limited orders to 
purchase the high end cutlery sets. Our plan of operations over the 12 month 
period following successful completion of our offering is to develop and 
establish our high end cutlery sets distribution business and hire one 
salesperson. We currently have high end cutlery sets available, but do not 
expect to be actively selling the products in an amount to sustain or business 
operations at a level we want until the completion of this offering. 

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, entering
into Agreements with our suppliers, purchasing first samples and commercial sets
available for sale, finding a website developer who is currently in the process
of developing our company`s website and the initial equity funding by our sole
officer and director. We have generated $45,830 in revenues to date and our
principal business activities to date consist of creating a business plan and
entering into a Supply Agreements, dated July 3, 2013, with ADA KITCHENWARE Imp
& Exp Co., Ltd., and dated June 30, 2013 with KITCHENSMITH Co. LTD, Chinese
companies (“ADA KITCHENWARE” and “KITCHENSMITH”), which are established
distributors of high end cutlery products. Both ADA KITCHENWARE and KITCHENSMITH
are large and well-established manufacturers and distributors of high end
cutlery sets in China. The terms and conditions of the Supply Agreements provide
that we have the right to purchase products at the item`s market prices as
identified in the Supply Agreements.
---

Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Dnipropetrovska Doroha, Apt. 
110, Odesa, Ukraine 65000. Our phone number is (415) 735-6610. In October 2013 
we signed a one year lease for office space located at 5803 SE Gladstone Street,
Portland, OR 97206. This site will serve as our U.S. shipping site and after we 
obtain funding we will obtain the necessary office equipment to set up the 
office for further operations. In January 2014 we purchased an office in Odesa, 
Ukraine to address the growing interest in our products in the European market. 
We also purchase a delivery truck which will allow us to deliver product which 
may be ordered in Europe. We are a development stage company, we only just 
completed our first fiscal year end on July 31, 2013 and we have no 
subsidiaries. Our website: www.songbirddevelopment.com.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of income. This section should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015, and our interim financial statements and accompanying notes to these financial statements. All amounts are in U.S. dollars.  Forward-Looking Statement Notice  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, our product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. In addition, from time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan," "may," "should" or "anticipate" or their negatives or other variations of these words or other comparable words or by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, various filings made by us with the SEC, press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. Forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our most recent annual report referenced below.  This report identifies important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, particularly those set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2015.  All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf speak only as of the date of this report and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. We undertake no obligations to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider these risks and uncertainties.  Overview  Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 27, 2012, to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of high end cutlery sets produced in China. We conducted this business through October 22, 2014. On October 22, 2014, we acquired an operating subsidiary, Knowledge Machine, Inc., a Nevada corporation, ("Knowledge Machine") and subsequently sold off our cutlery business. Knowledge Machine is a newly-formed technology company focused on targeting new technologies, acquiring licensing rights to those technologies, and marketing our licensed technologies. Knowledge Machine is our only subsidiary.  On October 22, 2014, we entered into a contract with and completed the acquisition of Knowledge Machine in a stock-for-stock exchange in which we issued 37,625,000 shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of Knowledge Machine in return of all of the outstanding shares of Knowledge Machine (the "Reorganization Agreement"). Knowledge Machine also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") with Igor Kaspruk, the sole officer, director and principal shareholder of the Company at the time, to acquire 2,464,716 shares of restricted stock held by him for $35,800. Following the closing of the Reorganization Agreement and the SPA, we sold the assets relating to the prior business of the Company to Mr. Kaspruk in return of 1,535,284 shares owned by him pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement between the Company and Mr. Kaspruk (the "APA"). In addition, Knowledge Machine loaned $14,200 to the Company to repay outstanding prior cash advances made by Mr. Kaspruk to the Company.  At the closing of the Reorganization Agreement, Mr. Kaspruk appointed Vivek R. Dave and Taylor Caswell to serve as directors of the Company and subsequently resigned as an officer and director of the Company. Thereafter, in connection with the closing of the SPA and the APA, the 4,000,000 restricted shares of common stock purchased by Knowledge Machine and the Company from Mr. Kaspruk in the above transactions were cancelled and returned to the authorized but unissued common stock of the Company.  As a result of the above transactions a change of control of the Company occurred from Mr. Kaspruk to Messrs. Dave and Caswell who assumed management control of the Company.  In connection with the closing of the Reorganization Agreement, the board of directors approved a one-for-ten forward stock split of the pre-closing outstanding shares and a change of the Company's name to "Knowledge Machine International, Inc." The forward stock split and name change were approved by written consent of Mr. Kaspruk as a majority shareholder immediately prior to the closing of the Reorganization Agreement. The name change and forward stock split were effective as of November 10, 2014. Articles of amendment with the State of Nevada were filed to reflect the forward stock split and name change effective as of November 10, 2014.  Upon completion of the above transactions, giving effect to the forward split of the pre-closing shares and cancellation of Mr. Kaspruk's shares, we have 47,625,000 shares of our common stock outstanding. Of these shares Messrs. Dave and Caswell own 6,500,000 shares or approximately 13.7% of our Company's outstanding stock. Former shareholders of Knowledge Machine, including Messrs. Dave and Caswell, own 37,625,000 shares of the Company, representing approximately 80% of the outstanding shares. The securities issued in the closing of the Reorganization Agreement were not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  In connection with the closing of the above transactions, we ceased our prior principal business operations (which were sold and transferred to Mr. Kaspruk pursuant to the APA). Upon completion of these transactions, we acquired Knowledge Machine (which is now our wholly-owned subsidiary) and became a technology company focused on targeting new technologies, acquiring licensing rights to those technologies, and marketing licensed technologies. Knowledge Machine was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 12, 2013, and commenced its operations in 2013. All references to business of the Company after the closing of the Reorganization Agreement refer to Knowledge Machine International, Inc. and Knowledge Machine, Inc., collectively.  Plan of Operations  Since its founding, Knowledge Machine has been involved in several activities both on an organizational front as well as the business development front. Organizationally, Knowledge Machine has created a Science Advisory Board that combines international business experience with high level science and technology expertise. Additionally, Knowledge Machine has been in close contact with regional development authorities in various states to see if there are potential teaming opportunities that take advantage of regional development funding or incentives. On the business development front, Knowledge Machine together with its Science Advisory Board has reviewed dozens of potential technologies for future licensing or joint venture activities upon future funding. Examples of these technologies include, but are not limited to:  � A new brain-wave based MMI - Man Machine Interface - that could be used for a wide range of applications;  � A weather prediction model and system that significantly outperforms current models in the critical time period from 14 days to a year in advance;  � New superenergetic materials for various defense applications;  � A 2.5D printing process, i.e. 2-D plus relief, that has applications to fine art printing;  � A spectrometric diagnostic method for analyzing blood samples for evidence of traumatic brain injury, or TBI;  � A new super-elastic materials technology; and  � An advanced explosives technology for mining.  These various discussions and a multitude of additional discussions not specifically referenced herein did not result in any material or definitive business agreements.  We are presently reviewing several possible transactions which could result in the merging of the Company with other business entities. As of the date of this filing there are no definitive business agreements that have resulted from these discussions and possible letters of intent. Depending on the specifics of each possible transaction, it is anticipated that additional funds will be needed and will be raised through sale of the Company's equity. At this time management does not have a specific target number as to the funds that will be raised as this number depends greatly on which potential transaction will be finalized and will lead to a definitive business agreement.  Results of Operations -Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  Gross Revenue. Gross revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0. Accordingly, there were no costs of goods sold. The Company was previously operating in the cutlery sales market but that business was sold and a new operating subsidiary was acquired which is operating in the technology market. This new line of business is in the development stage and has not yet recognized any revenue.  General and Administrative Expenses.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 totaled $46,200, a 49% decrease compared to general and administrative expenses of $90,165 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Management believes that general and administrative expenses will increase significantly with the Company's new business venture, particularly for professional, legal, and accounting fees going forward.  Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $46,200, compared to net loss of $90,142 during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Management anticipates that the Company will experience significant losses from operations during the startup phase of its new business venture.  Results of Operations -Nine Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2015  Gross Revenue. Gross revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0. Accordingly, there were no costs of goods sold. The Company was previously operating in the cutlery sales market but that business was sold and a new operating subsidiary was acquired which is operating in the technology market. This new line of business is in the development stage and has not yet recognized any revenue.  General and Administrative Expenses.General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 totaled $167,075, a 33% decrease compared to general and administrative expenses of $248,806 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015. Management believes that general and administrative expenses will increase significantly with the Company's new business venture, particularly for professional, legal, and accounting fees going forward.  Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, our net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 was $167,071, compared to net loss of $248,906 during the nine months ended March 31, 2015. Management anticipates that the Company will experience significant losses from operations during the startup phase of its new business venture.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2016, we had cash of $134 and prepaid expenses of $9,502, which is comprised of prepaid insurance and unvested stock issued to directors and Science Advisory Board members as prepayment for future services. We had current liabilities of $182,118 consisting of accounts payable and accounts payable-related parties. We had a working capital deficit of $172,482.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared contemplating a continuation of the Company as a going concern. We had ongoing operations during the period from December 12, 2013 (date of inception) to March 31, 2016 with an accumulated deficit of $732,232.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking
	statements,” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as
	“anticipates,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans” and “believes,”
	among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our management's expectations
	and assumptions about future events as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are inherently subject to uncertainties,
	risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations,
	beliefs or intentions regarding our product offerings, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects.
	You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters.
	Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they
	are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject
	to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied
	by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities
	and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views
	as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. We undertake no obligation to update, and
	we do not have a policy of updating or revising, these forward-looking statements.

	ITEM 1. BUSINESS.



	 



	Historical Background



	 


	On September 21,
	2016, the Company acquired a new operating subsidiary, EveryStory, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“


	EveryStory


	”).
	EveryStory offers a subscription-based service that captures, shares, and stores photos and audio in cloud. It offers the EveryStory
	platform, which enables users to preserve and share memories, and will initially target a Quality of Life benefit in certain patient
	populations, principally patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. As of the date of this Report, EveryStory
	was our only subsidiary. Additional information relating to the business and operations of EveryStory, which will become our business
	and operations, is given below. Prior to the closing of the EveryStory transaction, the Company was incorporated in the State
	of Nevada on December 27, 2012, to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of high end
	edged tools produced outside the US. We conducted this business through October 22, 2014. On October 22, 2014, we acquired an
	operating subsidiary, Knowledge Machine, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“


	Knowledge Machine


	”), which focused
	on new technologies, acquiring licensing rights to those technologies, and marketing the licensed technologies, and we sold off
	our edged tools business. In connection with the EveryStory transaction, we dissolved Knowledge Machine, and terminated the technology
	licensing and marketing operations.


	 


	Our principal offices
	are located at 9921 Carmel Mountain Road, Suite 118, San Diego, CA 92129.


	 


	The Company qualifies
	as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the “


	JOBS Act


	”).


	 



	Acquisition of EveryStory and Change of
	Management



	 




	Entry into Amended
	and Restated Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement; Completion of Acquisition of Assets




	 


	On September 21, 2016, we entered into an Amended
	and Restated Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement (the “


	A&R Agreement


	”) with EveryStory and each
	of its shareholder (the “


	Shareholders


	”), and closed the acquisition (the “


	Acquisition


	”)
	of the ownership of EveryStory (the “


	Closing


	”). We had previously announced our entry into the original
	version of the A&R Agreement, and noted that the closing of the transaction was contingent on the completion of certain closing
	conditions.


	 


	Pursuant to the A&R Agreement, we acquired
	all of the outstanding shares of EveryStory, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 77,377,712 shares of our common stock to the EveryStory
	holders, with the understanding that an additional 45,247,288 shares were to be reserved for issuance to holders of EveryStory
	derivative securities which are convertible or exercisable into shares of EveryStory common stock (collectively, the “


	Exchange
	Shares


	”). Additionally, prior to Closing, the parties agreed that certain shares of our common stock were to be returned
	to us for cancellation, resulting in our current shareholders owning an aggregate of 40,875,000 shares of our common stock immediately
	prior to the Closing.


	 


	Pursuant to the A&R Agreement, the 122,625,000
	Exchange Shares issued or to be issued to the EveryStory constituted 75% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common
	stock, and our legacy shareholders (who were the owners of our common stock immediately prior to the Closing) owned an aggregate
	of 40,875,000 shares, which constituted 25% of the total outstanding our common stock.


	 


	Management of both parties agreed, and the
	A&R Agreement provides, that following the Closing, we would conduct a reverse stock split (discussed in more detail below),
	following which the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock would convert into a total of 8,000,000 shares of post-reverse-split
	common stock. Following such conversion, the EveryStory owners will own or have the right to receive shares of our common stock
	equal to 60% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, and our legacy shareholders will own shares of our common stock
	equal to 40% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock, consisting of 8,000,000 shares of our common stock issued on conversion
	of our Series A Preferred Stock (20%) and 8,000,000 shares of our common stock owned by the our other legacy shareholders (20%).


	 


	 






	 



	1



	 







	 




	 


	As a result of the Closing of the A&R Agreement,
	EveryStory became our wholly owned subsidiary. Additionally (as discussed more fully below), our directors and officers immediately
	prior to the Closing appointed the EveryStory management to become our new officers and directors, and then resigned from their
	positions with us. In addition, we terminated our pre-Closing business operations and agreed to dissolve our other wholly owned
	subsidiary, Knowledge Machine.


	 


	There was no relationship between us and EveryStory
	or their principals or affiliates prior to the negotiation of the original agreement and the A&R Agreement.


	 




	Share Ownership Following
	Closing




	 


	Prior to Closing, we had 40,875,000 shares
	of our common stock outstanding. Upon Closing, we issued an aggregate of 77,377,712 shares of our common stock to the then current
	shareholders of EveryStory. Additionally, at Closing, EveryStory had options to issue a total of 600,000 shares of its common stock,
	and convertible debt securities that would be convertible into 672,533 shares of EveryStory’s common stock. In connection
	with the Closing, we agreed to reserve an aggregate of 45,247,288 shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the
	future exchange of shares of EveryStory common stock issued upon exercise of EveryStory options or conversion of EveryStory convertible
	debt securities.


	 




	Changes in Management




	 


	In connection with the Closing, Edward Cox,
	David Keene, and Larry Morgan were appointed as new members of our Board of Directors by the then-existing members of our Board
	of Directors, and Edward Cox was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. Immediately following the appointment of Messrs. Cox,
	Keene, and Morgan to the Board and Mr. Cox as the Chief Executive Officer, Vivek R. Dave and Taylor Caswell resigned all positions
	as members of our Board of Directors and as officers.


	 


	The resignations were agreed to by the former
	directors in connection with the execution of the A&R Agreement and the closing of the Acquisition. There were no disagreements
	between us and any of the former directors.


	 



	Business Overview



	 


	As noted above, in connection with the closing
	of the share exchange with EveryStory, we terminated our prior business, and intend to focus on implementing and developing the
	business of EveryStory as our primary business and operations.


	 




	Organization and
	Structure




	 


	By way of background, EveryStory, Inc., a Delaware
	corporation (“


	EveryStory


	” or the “


	Company


	”, or “we”, “our”,
	or “us”), was founded on September 5, 2013. From inception until EveryStory formally launched operations in September
	2015, EveryStory was a development stage company.


	 




	Overview –
	The Platform




	 


	EveryStory began as a new digital image story-sharing
	platform (the “


	Platform


	”) that allows users to collaboratively create, preserve and share personal stories
	in one place. Accessible via mobile devices on both iOS and Android systems, including mobile phones and tablets, as well as, desktops,
	EveryStory lets users store audio and image files to a private, secure cloud-based system with the option of sharing photos and
	stories with other EveryStory individual users and groups. Each user selects the members of his/her group, thereby creating private,
	secure micro social networks.


	 


	EveryStory is also actively exploring applications
	of its technology within the digital healthcare markets, as discussed in more detail below.


	 


	David Keene is the Chief Technical Officer
	and Founder of EveryStory. In his words: “I created EveryStory after being diagnosed with colon cancer and realizing my son
	might never remember my voice or hear my stories. I am passionate about providing people with an innovative way to preserve and
	share memories forever in the most interactive way possible.” Mr. Keene was successfully treated in 2012, and is now healthy
	and cancer-free.

	Through the EveryStory Platform, users can
	import photos from a computer or mobile device, photo album, or scan physical photos directly into the app using a device camera.
	EveryStory integrates a social network component by having activity-view functionality and by encouraging users to tag photos with
	people, locations, subjects or dates. EveryStory allows multiple users to record audio messages of any length on the same photos
	in a shared album or within a group, to create an interactive photo-album. Users can tap a tagged person’s name to hear the
	story that is connected to a specific photo or album.


	 


	Key components of EveryStory include:


	 



	Cloud-based Data Storage:

	Photos and
	audio stories are sent to the cloud immediately after being uploaded to the EveryStory Platform. Thus, both the photo stories and
	audio stories, while immediately accessible to users, are also safely stored on the cloud indefinitely.


	 



	Audio Recording:

	Users are able to record
	audio narrative and stories ranging from minutes to hours to accompany the photos naturally and organically – as if the stories
	were being told to a gathering of family or friends with whom the photos were being shared. Multiple users can record over one
	photo or a series of photos to tell the stories exactly as they as they happened and exactly how the user wants them to be heard.


	 



	Photo Importing:

	The EveryStory Platform
	allows users to import photos directly from a computer, an iOS photo album or an Android photo album. In addition, actual physical
	photographs can be scanned directly into the application using a device camera.


	 



	Playback Capabilities:

	EveryStory app
	users can listen to stories from the beginning, the middle or work backwards from the end. EveryStory’s proprietary playback
	technology allows users to enjoy photos and the stories that accompany them in virtually any way that they desire.


	 



	Collaborative Sharing:

	The EveryStory
	app allows users to create groups, large or small, family or friends or both, to enhance the users’ memories and experiences
	through contributed photos and stories in a private, secure sharing environment.


	 



	Designed for Mobile:

	Because the EveryStory
	app was designed for mobile platforms, it enables users to record and store life’s memorable moments as they happen and wherever
	the user is. The EveryStory app is available on iOS and Android.


	 



	Application of the Platform – Digital
	Therapeutics and Reminiscence Therapy



	 



	Digital Therapeutics



	 


	EveryStory’s technology Platform streamlines
	the creation of personalized digital stories, and our management is focused on the goal of becoming the first clinically-proven
	Digital Therapeutic technology targeting patients with Alzheimer's disease and Dementia.

	EveryStory
	already has received a US patent (issued in 2010) that broadly covers the use of EveryStory’s technology in Senior Living
	facilities.

	EveryStory is in the final stages of preparation to run a clinical trial with the University of California at
	San Diego (“


	UCSD


	”) showing that EveryStory is an effective anxiety reduction and quality of life therapy
	for those with Alzheimer’s disease or Dementia (“


	ADOD


	”).


	 


	In connection with this application of the
	Platform, EveryStory is focusing on the developing fields of Reminiscence Therapy and Digital Therapeutics.


	 



	Reminiscence Therapy (RT)



	 






	-


	Reminiscence Therapy involves either discussing or reviewing recognizable memories from the past
	and helps both calm and ground dementia patients when suffering from heightened anxiety




	 


	Reminiscence Therapy (RT) involves the discussion
	of past activities, events and experiences with another person or group of people, usually with the aid of tangible prompts such
	as photographs, household and other familiar items from the past, music and archive sound recordings. Reminiscence Therapy groups
	may involve group meetings in which participants are encouraged to talk about past events at least once a week. RT may also involve
	individual sessions, in which the person is guided chronologically through life experiences, encouraged to evaluate them, and may
	produce a life story book. Family care-givers are increasingly involved in reminiscence therapy. Reminiscence therapy is one of
	the most popular psychosocial interventions in dementia care, and is highly rated by staff and participants. There is evidence
	to suggest that RT is also effective in improving mood in older people without dementia. Its effects on mood, cognition and well-being
	in dementia are less well understood.


	 


	 






	 



	3



	 







	 




	 






	-


	EveryStory believes that one highly effective way to deliver RT to patients is through photos that
	bring back memories, and include voices that are familiar to them.








	-


	RT is a highly effective therapy for Alzheimer’s and Dementia patients. However, because
	it is very labor intensive, it is hard to scale to a large number of patients.




	 



	Digital Therapeutics



	 


	The term “digital therapeutics”
	refers to using a digital system to treat a medical condition, much as one might use a drug, a human counselor, or surgery. Digital
	therapeutics are used both stand-alone and in combination with conventional therapies.


	 






	-



	The goal of Digital Therapeutics is to mirror an effective treatment
	already in use but use technology to scale it to a large patien

	t population








	-


	A prime example of a successful Digital Therapeutic company is OmadaHealth, which is targeting
	diabetes by having people participate in a digital guided program that can delay the onset of early stage diabetes




	 



	Scale of the Markets (US)



	 






	-


	The 70+ population in the US is expected to grow faster than any other age group—from 28
	million in 2010 to 53 million by 2030








	-


	Alzheimer's and other dementias (ADOD)








	o


	For 2016, total payments for health care, long-term care and hospice are estimated to be $236 billion.









	-




	Senior Living and Long Term Care









	o


	The National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry (“


	NIC


	”)
	estimates expenditures for “long-term care services” between $210 and $306 billion




	 



	Annual Costs of Senior Living
	Care (US)



	 


	Costs required for the
	care ADOD patients are as much five times (average $77,381 per year) vs. someone of the same age without dementia ($15,550 per
	year)

	Business Model



	 



	Prior to the Closing
	of the Acquisition transaction with KMI, EveryStory had been in negotiations with the University of California at San Diego (“


	UCSD


	”)
	to conduct a clinical trial t

	o determine whether EveryStory and its Reminscence Therapy and Digital Therapeutics technology
	and implementation techniques are an effective in reducing anxiety and as part of quality of life improvement therapy for those
	with Alzheimer’s Disease or Dementia (“


	ADOD


	”).


	 



	Assuming that the
	results of the clinical trial match the anecdotal evidence that EveryStory has observed and experienced, once th

	e clinical
	trial has been completed and the data published, EveryStory intends to offer the Digital Therapeutics technology directly to the
	families of ADOD patients as a clinical supported therapy. Additionally, EveryStory intends to partner directly with Senior Living
	management firms, and to offer a revenue sharing arrangement for the patients and families of the Senior Living firms that chooses
	to implement the Therapy for their loved ones.


	 


	In both the direct-to-Patient and the Senior
	Living-management models, management anticipates that the product, which will include a digital tablet in the patient’s room,
	will cost approximately $20 per month, or $200 per year, per patient.


	 


	Additionally, EveryStory intends to find a
	partner in China to help make introductions to the Senior Living-type markets and other implementation techniques.


	 



	Intellectual Property



	 



	As noted above,
	EveryStory has acquired an issued patent from Seniors in Touch, Patent Number US 7721946 B2 (the “


	ES Patent


	”)
	on its technology. The title of the ES Patent is “EveryStory Senior Living Patent,” and is summarized as follows: “

	A
	system and method is disclosed whereby a patient at a senior care facility can send and receive messages via the inter-net. Tools
	are provided to manage the patients, the patient's relative contact, mail and photo collection. Relatives can be designated to
	suggest changes to the contacts and edit the contents of the patient's contacts files. The messages may be audio, video or text
	and the user friendly system helps the patients navigate through the process. Notification is provided so that the relatives and
	patients know when a message had been received. Further notification is provided if a prolonged period lapses after receipt of
	a message to a patient and the message has not been read.

	” The ES Patent was filed on February
	21, 2007, and the publication date was May 25, 2010.



	 


	In addition EveryStory has
	filed additional patents:


	 






	1.


	EveryStory server platform: -a RESTful cloud based API for storing and organizing audio, text and
	video stories








	2.


	EveryStory client applications: -native iOS and android applications for capturing and creating
	stories

	Operations



	 


	Substantially all of EveryStory’s communications,
	network and the computer hardware used to operate our websites are co-located in a third-party facility. In addition, we use a
	combination of third-party, Internet-based or cloud computing services and off-site backup services in connection with our business
	operations and our disaster recovery systems. We have designed our websites to be highly available, secure and cost-effective using
	a variety of proprietary software, third-party services and freely available and commercially supported tools. We can scale to
	accommodate increasing numbers of registered users by adding relatively inexpensive industry-standard software. We use encryption
	technologies and certificates for secure transmission of personal information between users and our websites.


	 



	Competition



	 


	EveryStory’s prior operations, relating
	principally to social-media-type applications of the Platform faced indirect competition from companies in the photo archiving,
	photo/audio interconnectivity, social networking and cloud storage sectors. Many of these companies are considerably larger, have
	greater resources and a longer operating history than does EveryStory. Management believes, however, that this is indirect competition
	because, to the best of management’s knowledge, there is not a competitor product that has the storytelling capability of
	the EveryStory platform. Management expects that competition in the sector will grow and become more intense through industry consolidation
	as well as the emergence of new participants in EveryStory’s market. EveryStory intends to compete on the basis of ease of
	use, technology, brand recognition, quality of products and service and support. Our competitive strategy may be significantly
	affected in the future by many external factors. Among them are marketing costs, technology and our current and future competitors’
	pricing and marketing strategies.


	 


	As we build and develop the digital therapeutics
	applications of the Platform, we will continue to review and disclose information relating to competition in the digital therapeutic
	markets.


	 



	Near-Term Changes Anticipated – Reverse
	Stock Split, Name Change



	 


	As noted in a Current Report filed on October
	6, 2016, prior to the closing of the EveryStory transaction, we sought and obtained shareholder approval to amend the Company’s
	Articles of Incorporation (as amended to date) to effectuate a reverse stock split of our common stock (the “


	Reverse
	Split


	”). The Company’s new management team has taken steps to effectuate the reverse stock split, including
	filing a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles with the Nevada Secretary of State’s office, and filing an Issuer Company
	Related Action Notification with FINRA to effectuate the Reverse Split.


	 


	The Certificate of Amendment also changes the
	Company’s name from Knowledge Machine International, Inc., to Dthera Sciences. Management believes that the new name will
	better reflect the focus of the Company on the digital therapeutic and reminiscence therapy markets which will be the Company’s
	new primary focus.


	 


	Assuming that we can complete all regulatory
	filings and provide the required information, the Reverse Split and the name change should take effect on October 14, 2016. We
	will provide additional information relating to the effectiveness of these transactions in our public filings.


	 



	Employees



	 


	As of the date of the Report, the Company had
	one full-time employee, our Chief Executive Officer, and no part-time employees. Other than the CEO, all others working with the
	Company are consultants, working with the Company under consulting agreements. Management believes that our relationship with these
	consultants is good.



	 





	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.



	 


	An investment in our Company involves significant
	risks, including the risks described below. You should consult with your own financial and legal advisors and carefully consider
	the material risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the
	following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and the trading price
	of our common stock could decline.


	 



	Risks Related to Our Company and Its Business



	 




	We have a limited operating history and
	limited historical financial information upon which you may evaluate our performance.




	 


	You should consider, among other factors, our
	prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that, like us, are in their early stages
	of development. We may not successfully address the usual and ordinary risks and uncertainties associated with being an early stage
	company or successfully implement our existing and new products and services. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our
	business. Even if we accomplish these objectives, we may not generate the positive cash flows or profits we anticipate in the future.
	Unanticipated problems, expenses and delays are frequently encountered in establishing a new business and developing new products
	and services. These include, but are not limited to, inadequate funding, lack of consumer acceptance, competition, product development,
	and inadequate sales and marketing. Our failure to meet any of these conditions would have a material adverse effect upon us and
	may force us to reduce or curtail our operations. No assurance can be given that we will operate profitably. Even though we are
	being managed by individuals with significant industry experience, our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict
	the long-term success of our business model.


	 


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 




	We depend on key personnel.




	 


	For the foreseeable future, our success will
	depend largely on management’s industry knowledge, marketing skills and relationships with key investors, customer bases,
	and industry leaders. We have one full-time employee, our Chief Executive Officer. All others working with the Company are outside
	consultants providing services to the Company in their areas of expertise. Should any of these individuals leave EveryStory or
	cease to provide consulting services, such departures may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.


	 




	We will indemnify Management and the
	members of the Board of Directors.




	 


	These key decision-makers will be entitled
	to indemnification from EveryStory except in certain circumstances, as more fully set forth in our Articles of Incorporation and
	Bylaws, each as amended or amended and restated.


	 




	If we fail to effectively manage growth,
	our business, brand and reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.




	 


	We may experience a rapid growth in operations,
	which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to
	grow, we must effectively identify, integrate, develop and motivate new employees, and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate
	culture. To attract top talent, we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages. The risks of over-hiring or
	over-compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability. Additionally, if
	we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, brand
	and reputation, results of operations and financial condition. If operational, technology and infrastructure improvements are not
	implemented successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures
	to address these issues. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management
	controls and our reporting systems and procedures. This will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain
	effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate
	with each other and our growing base of customers. These system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental
	and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements
	and maintenance programs effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that
	are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses.


	 




	If our efforts
	to retain and attract subscribers are not successful, our revenues may be materially affected.




	 


	We intend to generate
	substantially all of our revenues from subscriptions to our services. We must continue to retain existing and attract new subscribers,
	which we seek to do in part by investing in our product platform and new services and technologies. If our efforts to satisfy our
	existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them, and, as a result, our revenues would be adversely affected.
	For example, if consumers do not perceive our services to be reliable, valuable and of high quality, if we fail to regularly introduce
	new and improved services and more content, or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by the market, we may
	not be able to retain existing or attract new subscribers. We rely on our marketing and advertising efforts to attract new subscribers.
	If we are unable to effectively retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers, our business, financial condition and
	results of operations would be materially adversely affected.


	 




	If we experience
	excessive rates of subscriber cancellation, our revenues and business may be harmed.




	 


	We must continually
	add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who choose to cancel their subscriptions and to grow our business beyond our current
	subscriber base. Subscribers may choose to cancel their subscriptions for many reasons, including a desire to reduce discretionary
	spending, a perception that they do not have sufficient time to use the service or otherwise do not use the service sufficiently,
	the service is a poor value, competitive services provide a better value or experience or subscriber service issues are not satisfactorily
	resolved. Subscribers may choose to cancel their subscriptions at any time prior to the renewal date. We may also experience fluctuations
	in cancellations as we pursue new subscribers through new marketing channels or if we have a large number of subscriptions come
	up for renewal in the same period.


	 


	 






	 



	7



	 







	 




	 


	If our subscriber
	cancellations increase, we would be required to increase the rate at which we add new subscribers in order to maintain and grow
	our revenues. If excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing
	and advertising expenses than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers. If we are unable to attract
	new subscribers in numbers greater than the impact of our cancellations, our subscriber base will decrease and our business, financial
	condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.


	 




	Our business depends substantially on
	customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our services. Any decline in our customer renewals or
	failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our services would harm our future operating results.






	 




	In order for us to maintain or improve our
	operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires.
	Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration, and we cannot assure you that customers will renew
	subscriptions at the same or higher level of service, if at all.


	 


	Our retention rate may
	decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our
	services, the effectiveness of our customer support services, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, the effects
	of global economic conditions or reductions in our customers’ spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions
	or renew on less favorable terms, our revenue may decline, and we may not realize improved operating results from our customer
	base.




	 






	A change in
	our mix of subscription durations could have a significant impact on our revenues, net subscribers and revenue visibility.




	 


	We intend periodically
	to evaluate and test the types of subscriptions that we offer. Based on the results of any product or price testing conducted,
	we may change the types of subscriptions we offer or we may price and market different types of subscriptions. If a higher percentage
	of our subscribers choose a shorter subscription duration, we would likely experience higher cancellation volumes, which may result
	in decreased immediate and long-term revenues. In the future, we may continue to perform product and price tests involving our
	prospective users, the results of which could affect our number or mix of subscribers and may have a material adverse impact on
	our results of operations, and key operating metrics.


	 




	We cannot accurately predict new subscription
	rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.






	 




	In order for us to improve our operating results
	and continue to grow our business, it is important that we continue to attract new customers. To the extent we are successful in
	increasing our customer base, we could incur increased losses because costs associated with new customers are generally incurred
	up front, while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of our subscription services. Alternatively, to the extent we are unsuccessful
	in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products
	intended to attract new customers would not be offset by incremental revenue and cash flow. All of these factors can negatively
	impact our future revenue and operating results.


	 




	If our marketing
	and advertising efforts fail to generate additional revenues on a cost-effective basis, or if we are unable to manage our marketing
	and advertising expenses, it could materially harm our results of operations and growth.




	 


	Our future growth
	and profitability, as well as the maintenance and enhancement of our brands, will depend in large part on the effectiveness and
	efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures. We intend to use a diverse mix of marketing and advertising programs
	to promote our products and services, and we plan periodically to adjust our mix of these programs. Significant increases in the
	pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expense or cause
	us to choose less effective marketing and advertising channels. Further, we may over time become disproportionately reliant on
	one channel or partner, which could increase our operating expenses. Because we recognize revenues ratably over the subscription
	period, we have incurred and may in the future incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we
	anticipate recognizing revenues associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising

	expenditures
	may not continue to result in increased revenues or generate sufficient levels of brand awareness. If we are unable to maintain
	our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly
	effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our subscriber levels could be affected
	adversely, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In addition, our expanded marketing efforts
	may increase our subscriber acquisition cost, as additional expenses may not result in sufficient customer growth to offset cost,
	which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	Any significant
	disruption in service on our Web site or in our computer systems, which are currently hosted primarily by a single third-party,
	could damage our reputation and result in a loss of subscribers, which would harm our business and operating results.




	 


	Subscribers access
	our service through our Web site and through mobile device apps. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve
	our subscribers depend upon the reliable performance of our Web site, network infrastructure, content delivery processes and payment
	systems. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins,
	could affect the security or availability of our Web site and prevent our subscribers from accessing our data and using our products
	and services. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems may harm our reputation and require disclosure to our lenders,
	and the cost of remedying these problems could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	Substantially all
	of our communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our Web site are located in facilities owned and operated
	by a third party. We do not own or control the operation of these facilities. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage
	or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical
	break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could result in damage
	to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient
	to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our systems are not completely redundant, so a failure of our system at our primary
	site could result in reduced functionality for our customers, and a total failure of our systems at both sites could cause our
	Web site to be inaccessible by our customers. Problems faced by our third-party Web hosting provider, with the telecommunications
	network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers, including us,
	could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers. Our third-party Web hosting provider could decide to close its facilities
	without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy reorganization, faced by our third-party Web
	hosting provider or any of the service providers with whom it contracts may have negative effects on our business, the nature and
	extent of which are difficult to predict. Additionally, if our third-party Web hosting provider is unable to keep up with our growing
	needs for capacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance
	problems with our services could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
	of operations.


	 




	Our possession
	and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or use of such
	data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to significant liability and damage our reputation.




	 


	Maintaining the security
	of our information technology and network systems infrastructure is of critical importance because we handle confidential subscriber,
	registered user, employee and other sensitive data, such as names, addresses, credit card numbers and other personal information.
	In addition, our online systems include the content that our registered users upload onto our Web sites, such as family records
	and photos. This content is often personally meaningful, and our registered users may rely on our online system to store digital
	copies of such content. If we were to lose such content, if our users’ private content were to become publicly available
	or if third parties were able to gain unauthorized access to such content, we may face liability and harm to our brand and reputation.


	 


	We anticipate that
	most of our subscribers will use credit and debit cards to purchase our products and services. If we or our processing vendors
	were to have problems with our billing software, it could have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and could cause
	one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services. In addition, if our billing
	software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our subscribers’ credit cards on a timely basis or at
	all, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected.


	 


	We and our vendors
	use commercially available encryption technology to transmit personal information when taking orders. We use security and business
	controls to limit access and use of personal information, including registered users’ uploaded content. However, third parties
	may be able to circumvent these security and business measures including by developing and deploying viruses, worms and other malicious
	software programs that are designed to attack or attempt to infiltrate our systems and networks. In addition, employee error, malfeasance
	or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of registered user or employee
	privacy.


	 


	Additionally, we may
	not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data. If we experience a security breach or other lapse
	in the handling of confidential information of this kind, the incident could give rise to risks including data loss, litigation
	and liability, and could harm our reputation or disrupt our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.
	In addition, various states and countries have differing laws regarding protection of customer privacy and confidential information,
	including notification requirements in the event of certain breaches or losses of information. Efforts to comply with these laws
	and regulations increase our costs of doing business and failure to achieve compliance could result in substantial liability to
	our business and harm our reputation. In the event of a security breach or loss of confidential information, we could be subject
	to fines, penalties, damages and other remedies under applicable laws, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our
	reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.

	If third parties
	improperly obtain and use the personal information of our registered users or employees, we may be required to expend significant
	resources in efforts to address these problems. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative
	consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our products and services,
	an unwillingness of subscribers to provide us with their credit card or payment information, an unwillingness of registered users
	to upload family records or photos onto our Web sites, harm to our reputation and brand and loss of our ability to accept and
	process subscriber credit card orders. Similarly, if a well-publicized breach of data security at any other major consumer Web
	site were to occur, there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the Internet for commercial transactions.
	Any of these events could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
	we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses.


	 




	We do not expect to be profitable for
	the foreseeable future.






	 




	We will have losses and
	accumulated deficit as a result of the substantial investments we will make to acquire new customers and develop our services.
	We intend to continue scaling our business to increase our number of users and to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers.
	We expect to invest and to continue to invest, in our sales and marketing organizations to sell our services around the world and
	in our development organization to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers’
	evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make significant investments in our datacenter infrastructure and in our professional
	service organization as we focus on customer success. As a result of our continuing investments to scale our business in each of
	these areas, we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing
	our customer base, we will also incur increased losses due to upfront costs associated with acquiring new customers, particularly
	as a result of the limited free trial version of our service, and the nature of subscription revenue which is generally recognized
	ratably over the term of the subscription period. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that,
	if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.


	 




	The market in which we participate is
	intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.






	 




	The market for our cloud-based
	interactive photo and audio storytelling platform services is fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively
	low barriers to entry for certain applications and services. Many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have
	greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we
	do. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, large social media companies with a focus on family history; cloud storage
	companies that enable users to store photos, videos and photos that record sound to cloud-based private accounts; individualized
	media platforms that allow users to post compilations of images and videos; and file hosting services that offer users cloud-based
	file storage that can be accessed by any of the user’s computers or devices. With the introduction of new technologies and
	market entrants, we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our business
	will be harmed. Some of our principal competitors may offer their products or services at a lower price, which will result in pricing
	pressures on our business. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our operating results would be negatively impacted.
	In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, lower margins, losses or the
	failure of our services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.


	 


	Many of our competitors
	are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services. As a result, our competitors
	may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.
	For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.


	 




	If the cloud-based collaboration-ready
	interactive micro-social network market develops more slowly than we expect or if it declines, our business could be materially
	adversely affected. If the EveryStory Legacy Program is not successful or develops more slowly than we expect, our business could
	be materially adversely affected.






	 




	The cloud-based collaboration-ready
	interactive micro-social network (“


	CRIMSN


	”) market, for which EveryStory’s software platform was
	designed, is a relatively new market and not firmly established. Accordingly, it is uncertain whether a cloud-based service like
	EveryStory’s will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Because we derive, and expect
	to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from sales of our cloud-based CRIMSN solution, our success
	will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of cloud-based content collaboration
	services in particular. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate
	and size of the cloud computing market or the entry of competitive services. The expansion of a cloud-based CRIMSN market depends
	on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud computing, as well as the ability
	of companies that provide cloud-based services to address security and privacy concerns. If we or other providers of cloud-based
	services experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud-based
	services as a whole, including our services, may be negatively affected. If cloud-based services do not achieve widespread adoption,
	or there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based services caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening
	economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise,
	it could result in decreased revenue, harm our growth rates, and adversely affect our business and operating results.] EveryStory
	is currently making arrangements to conduct pilot programs with some of the nation’s largest wealth management firms to offer
	a white-labeled version of the EveryStory platform as a tool to assist the firms to improve rates of intergenerational client retention
	(“


	Legacy Program


	”). If the EveryStory Legacy Program is not successful or develops more slowly than EveryStory
	expects, EveryStory’s business could be materially adversely affected.

	If we are not able to provide successful
	enhancements, new features and modifications to our services, our business could be adversely affected.






	 




	Our industry is marked by rapid technological
	developments and new and enhanced applications and services. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our
	existing services or new services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business
	could be adversely affected. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely
	completion, introduction and market acceptance of such enhancements, features or services. Failure in this regard may significantly
	impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of systems, we will need to continuously
	modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, mobile operating systems such as iOS and
	Android, and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these
	modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, modifications to existing platforms
	or technologies will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future
	network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect
	our business.


	 




	Our platform must integrate with a variety
	of operating systems and software applications that are developed by others, and if we are unable to ensure that our solutions
	interoperate with such systems and applications, our service may become less competitive, and our operating results may be harmed.






	 




	We offer our services across
	a variety of operating systems and through the internet. We are dependent on the interoperability of our platform with third-party
	mobile devices, desktop and mobile operating systems, as well as web browsers that we do not control. Any changes in such systems,
	devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our services or give preferential treatment to competitive services could
	adversely affect usage of our services. In order to deliver high quality services, it is important that they work well with a range
	of operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards that we do not control. In addition, because a substantial
	number of our users access our services through mobile devices, we are particularly dependent on the interoperability of our services
	with mobile devices and operating systems. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile
	industry or in developing services that operate effectively with these operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards.
	In the event that it is difficult for our users to access and use our services, our user growth may be harmed, and our business
	and operating results could be adversely affected.


	 




	Our business depends on continued and
	unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our members on personal computers and mobile devices. If government regulations relating
	to the Internet or other areas of our business change, if Internet access providers are able to block, degrade, or charge for access
	to certain of our products and services, or if third parties disrupt access to the Internet, we could incur additional expenses
	and the loss of members and customers.






	 




	Our products and services depend on the ability
	of our members and customers to access the Internet through their personal computers and mobile devices. Currently, this access
	is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent
	telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers, any of whom could
	take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to our products or solutions, which would, in turn, negatively
	impact our business. In addition, Internet access could be disrupted by other third parties. Further, the adoption of any laws
	or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws limiting Internet neutrality,
	could decrease the demand for our subscription service or the usage of our services and increase our cost of doing business.

	One of our marketing strategies is to
	offer a limited free version of our service, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy.






	 




	We offer a limited version of our service to
	users free of charge in order to promote additional usage, brand and product awareness, and adoption. Some users never convert
	from a free version to a paid version of our service. Our marketing strategy also depends in part on persuading users who use the
	free version of our service to convince others to purchase and use our service. To the extent that these users do not become, or
	lead others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy, and our ability
	to grow our business and revenue may be harmed.


	 




	Any failure to protect our intellectual
	property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.






	 




	Our success and ability to compete depend in
	part on our intellectual property. As of May 17, 2016, EveryStory had one patent pending application in the U.S. As EveryStory
	continues to develop its intellectual property, it will file additional patent applications as appropriate. We primarily rely on
	copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees,
	customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual
	property rights may be inadequate. Our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents. If we file patent applications
	outside the U.S., we may have to expend significant resources to obtain additional patents as we expand our international operations


	 


	In order to protect our intellectual property
	rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and
	enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the
	impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights
	may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property
	rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.
	Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our brand and adversely
	impact our business.


	 




	We rely on third parties for certain
	financial and operational services essential to our ability to manage our business. A failure or disruption in these services could
	materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively.






	 




	We rely on third parties for certain essential
	financial and operational services. Traditionally, the vast majority of these services have been provided by large enterprise software
	vendors who license their software to customers. However, we receive many of these services on a subscription basis from various
	software-as-a-service companies that are smaller and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. Moreover,
	these vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. As a
	result, we depend upon these vendors providing us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that
	could cause disruptions in our business processes, which would adversely affect our ability to operate and manage our operations.


	 




	We focus on product innovation and user
	engagement rather than short-term operating results.






	 




	We focus on developing and launching new and
	innovative products and features, as well as on improving the user experience for our services. We also focus on growing the number
	of EveryStory users and paying organizations through indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some
	of whom use our services at no cost. We prioritize innovation and the experience for users on our platform, as well as the growth
	of our user base, over short-term operating results. We make product and service decisions that may reduce our short-term operating
	results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the user experience and to develop innovative
	features that we feel our users desire. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of investors and
	may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.


	 




	We plan to provide service level commitments
	under our subscription agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or
	refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face subscription terminations, which could adversely affect
	our revenue. Furthermore, any failure in our delivery of high-quality customer support services may adversely affect our relationships
	with our customers and our financial results.






	 




	We anticipate that our subscription agreements
	with customers will provide certain service level commitments. If we are unable to meet these stated service level commitments
	or suffer periods of downtime that exceed the periods allowed under our customer agreements, we may be obligated to provide these
	customers with service credits which could significantly impact our revenue in the period in which the downtime occurs and the
	credits could be due. We could also face subscription terminations, which could significantly impact both our current and future
	revenue. Any extended service outages could also adversely affect our reputation, which would also impact our future revenue and
	operating results.

	Our customers depend
	on our customer success organization to resolve technical issues relating to our services. We may be unable to respond quickly
	enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services,
	without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process
	is highly dependent on the ease of use of our services, on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers.
	Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could
	adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers.


	 




	Our services contain open source software,
	whose licenses may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative
	impact on our business.






	 




	We use open source software in our services
	and will use open source software in the future. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming
	ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which
	could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These
	claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license
	or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process
	could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In
	addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party
	commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Additionally,
	because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual
	property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we are unable to prevent our competitors
	or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and,
	if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.


	 




	We plan to conduct a clinical trial of
	the use of our Platform as a reminiscence therapy and digital therapeutic technique for treating patients with Alzheimer’s
	disease and dementia, but there is no guarantee that the trial will be successful, or that the results will prove that the use
	of our Platform as a treatment technique will be successful.




	 


	As discussed, we have been in negotiations
	with the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to conduct a clinical trial of the use of our Platform as a reminiscence
	therapy and digital therapeutic technique for treating patients with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. However, there is
	no guarantee that the trial will be successful, or that the results will prove that the use of our Platform as a treatment technique
	will be successful. Additionally, decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a therapy candidate
	can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities once the therapy receives regulatory
	approval. For example, more detailed studies can lead to approval or acceptance for a broader set of indications that may impact
	the marketing and payer reimbursement process, but each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required
	to demonstrate benefit and the potential delays to approval of the primary indication. Trials also frequently do not achieve the
	primary endpoints set forth in the trial design. Management anticipates that the Company will try to plan clinical trials prudently
	and to reasonably foresee and address challenges, but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct, speed,
	and desired outcome will be achieved each time or at all. The degree to which these challenges are foreseen and addressed could
	affect our future results.


	 




	As we enter the digital health and therapy
	market, our business may be subject to government regulation, and will be impacted by economic and business conditions, which may
	have a negative impact on our ability to develop and implement our business strategy, and our ability to continue operations.




	 


	The digital healthcare business may be impacted
	by economic volatility, consumer spending patterns and market share gains of competitors’ branded products. Additionally,
	the digital healthcare market is largely new and untested; the uptake of products may not meet uptake projections as there is little
	to no prior data. Although digital healthcare products exist, they are mostly focused on helping or focusing on aspects such as
	diet, smoking cessation, and medication management. The categorization of our Platform as a participant in the digital healthcare
	space will require successful research studies. In addition, the US Health Industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent
	and substantial changes. The impacts of these regulations and the general market conditions could have a negative impact on our
	business and operations.

	Future acquisitions and investments could
	disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.






	 




	Our success will depend, in part, on our ability
	to expand our services and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures.
	In some circumstances, we may choose to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than
	through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly,
	and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:


	 







	·



	diversion of management time and focus from operating the business to addressing acquisition integration
	challenges; coordination of research and development and sales and marketing functions;









	·



	retention of key employees from the acquired company;









	·



	cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;









	·



	integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources
	and other administrative systems;









	·



	the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to
	the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;









	·



	liabilities for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual
	property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;









	·



	unanticipated write-offs or charges; and









	·



	litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated
	employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.




	 


	Our failure to address these risks or other
	problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated
	benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future
	acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities,
	amortization expenses, incremental operating expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition
	or operating results.


	 




	Unfavorable general economic conditions
	in the United States or in other major markets could negatively impact our financial performance.




	 


	Unfavorable general economic conditions, such
	as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States


	or in other major markets, could negatively
	affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for our services. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce
	discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our services or by shifting away from our platform to lower-priced products or
	services offered by other companies. Softer consumer demand for our services in the United States or in other major markets could
	reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our financial performance.



	 





	Many individuals use mobile devices to
	access online services. If users of these devices do not widely adopt the proprietary platform we develop for these devices or
	if we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.






	 




	The number of people who access online services
	through mobile devices, such as smart phones, handheld tablets and mobile telephones, as opposed to personal computers, has increased
	dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet
	the needs of prospective and current customers, they may not sign up or reduce their usage of our platform and our business could
	suffer. Additionally, we are dependent on the interoperability of our proprietary platform with popular mobile operating systems
	that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions’
	functionality, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, could adversely affect traffic and monetization on mobile
	devices. We may not be successful in maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry
	or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. Each manufacturer
	or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable
	on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. As new devices
	and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions
	of our solutions for use on these alternative devices, and we are devoting significant resources to the support and maintenance
	of such devices.


	 




	Our solutions and internal systems rely
	on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.






	 




	Our solutions and internal systems rely on
	software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of our software
	to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain,
	undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be discovered after the code has been released
	for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within our software may result in a negative experience for members
	or customers, delay product introductions or enhancements, or result in measurement or other errors. Any errors, bugs, or defects
	discovered in our software could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue, or liability for damages,
	any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.


	 


	 






	 



	14



	 







	 




	 




	We face competition in the market from
	social networking sites and Internet search companies, among others, as well as continued competition for customers.






	 




	We face significant competition in all aspects
	of our business, and we expect such competition to increase, particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement
	of professionals.


	 


	Our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming
	increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us. Smaller
	companies, including application developers, could also launch new products and services that compete with us and that could gain
	market acceptance quickly. We may also face competition if we shift our focus of development to new or different products or separate
	areas of our business.


	 




	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter
	documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace
	or remove our current management and limit any eventual market price of our common stock.






	 




	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate
	of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes
	in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:


	 









	·




	authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action
	by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;










	·




	specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only
	by the Chair of our board of directors, our President, Vice President, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, and shall be called at
	the request of stockholders holding a majority of the capital stock of EveryStory; and










	·




	provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only
	by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.





	 


	These provisions may frustrate
	or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders
	to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Provisions in
	the indenture related to our convertible debt may also deter or prevent a business combination. In addition, institutional shareholder
	representative groups, shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices,
	including our dual class structure and the other anti-takeover provisions, such as those listed above. We generally will consider
	recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups, but we will make decisions based on what our board and management
	believe to be in the best long term interests of our company and stockholders. Our dual class structure concentrates the voting
	power of our stock in a small group of stockholders who would have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote. Additionally,
	these groups could make recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our
	positions. Finally, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
	General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations
	with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an
	“interested” stockholder.



	 





	The forward looking statements contained
	in this Report may prove incorrect.




	 


	This Report contains certain forward-looking
	statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks
	and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In addition to the other risks
	described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” discussion, important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking
	statements include: (i) changes to external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact
	trends in our results of operations; (ii) anticipated working capital or other cash requirements; (iii) changes in our business
	strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in our industry; and (iv) various competitive factors
	that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace. In light of these risks and uncertainties, many of which are
	described in greater detail elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” discussion, there can be no assurance that the events
	predicted in forward-looking statements contained in this Report will, in fact, transpire. Any negative change in the factors listed
	above could adversely affect the financial condition and operating results of EveryStory and its products.

	Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common
	Stock



	 




	We have not paid, and do not intend to
	pay, dividends on our common stock and therefore, unless our common stock appreciates in value, our investors may not benefit from
	holding our common stock.




	 


	We have not paid any cash dividends on our
	common stock since inception. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result,
	investors in our common stock will not be able to benefit from owning our common stock unless the market price of our common stock
	becomes greater than the price paid for the stock by investors.


	 




	The public trading market for our common
	stock is volatile and may result in higher spreads in stock prices, which may limit the ability of our investors to sell their
	shares at a profit, if at all.




	 


	Our common stock trades in the over-the-counter
	market and is quoted on the OTCPink, with little trading volume or activity. The over-the-counter market for securities has historically
	experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
	the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses to our investors. In addition, the spreads on stock traded
	through the over-the-counter market are generally unregulated and higher than on stock exchanges, which means that the difference
	between the price at which shares could be purchased by investors in the over-the-counter market compared to the price at which
	they could be subsequently sold would be greater than on these exchanges. Significant spreads between the bid and asked prices
	of the stock could continue during any period in which a sufficient volume of trading is unavailable or if the stock is quoted
	by an insignificant number of market makers. Historically, our trading volume has been insufficient to significantly reduce this
	spread and we have had a limited number of market makers sufficient to affect this spread. These higher spreads could adversely
	affect investors who purchase the shares at the higher price at which the shares are sold, but subsequently sell the shares at
	the lower bid prices quoted by the brokers. Unless the bid price for the stock exceeds the price paid for the shares by the investor,
	plus brokerage commissions or charges, the investor could lose money on the sale. For higher spreads such as those on over-the-counter
	stocks, this is likely a much greater percentage of the price of the stock than for exchange listed stocks. There is no assurance
	that at the time an investor in our common stock wishes to sell the shares, the bid price will have sufficiently increased to create
	a profit on the sale.


	 




	We do not know whether a market for our
	common stock will be sustained or what the market price of our common stock will be and as a result it may be difficult for investors
	to sell their shares of our common stock.




	 


	Although our common stock is eligible for quotation
	on the OTC Pink, an active trading market for our shares has not commenced and may not be sustainable. It may be difficult for
	investors to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all. As a result of these and other factors,
	investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the offering price or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair
	our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships
	or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration. If an active market for our common stock
	does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell your common stock.


	 




	Our Board can, without stockholder approval,
	cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that adversely affect common stockholders or which could be used to resist a potential
	take-over of the Company.




	 


	Under our Articles of Incorporation, our Board
	is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 100,000 of which are issued and outstanding. Also, our Board,
	without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights,
	of those shares. If the Board causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our common stock could
	be adversely affected. The Board’s ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing
	desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it
	more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred shares issued by the Board could
	include voting rights, or even super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control the Company to the holders of the
	preferred stock. Preferred shares could also have conversion rights into shares of common stock at a discount to the market price
	of the common stock which could negatively affect the market for our common stock. In addition, preferred shares would have preference
	in the event of liquidation of the corporation, which means that the holders of preferred shares would be entitled to receive the
	net assets of the corporation distributed in liquidation before the common stock holders receive any distribution of the liquidated
	assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

	The market price of our common stock
	may fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses by our investors.




	 


	The market price of our common stock may fluctuate
	significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:


	 




	 



	·




	announcements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements by us or others;





	 




	 




	·





	announcements by us of significant strategic partnerships, out-licensing, in-licensing, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments;





	 




	 




	·





	expiration or terminations of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements;





	 




	 



	·




	public concern as to the safety of products we, our licensors or others develop;





	 




	 



	·




	success of research and development projects;





	 




	 



	·




	developments concerning intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals;





	 




	 



	·




	variations in our and our competitors’ results of operations;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in government regulations or patent decisions;





	 




	 



	·




	developments by our licensors;





	 




	 



	·




	developments in the technology industry;





	 




	 



	·




	the results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;





	 




	 



	·




	future issuances of common stock or other securities;





	 




	 



	·




	the addition or departure of key personnel;





	 




	 



	·




	announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances;





	 




	 



	·




	general market conditions, including the volatility of market prices for shares of technology companies generally, and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance; and





	 




	 



	·




	the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.





	 


	These factors and any corresponding price fluctuations
	may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses by our investors.


	 


	Further, the stock market in general, and the
	market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past. Continued market
	fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our
	common stock. Price volatility of our common stock might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In the past,
	following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved
	in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and attention of management from our business,
	even if we are successful. Future sales of our common stocks could also reduce the market price of such stock.


	 


	Moreover, the liquidity of our common stock
	is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but by delays in the timing
	of transactions and reduction in security analysts’ and the media’s coverage of us, if any. These factors may result
	in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid
	and ask prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies
	with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of
	an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively
	small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public
	float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future.


	 


	Some or all of the “restricted”
	shares of our common stock issued in connection with the Acquisition or held by other of our stockholders may be offered from time
	to time in the open market pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 promulgated under Regulation D of the Securities
	Act, and these sales may have a depressive effect on the market for our common stock.


	 


	 






	 



	17



	 







	 




	 




	Raising additional capital by issuing
	securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders.




	 


	We will need to raise substantial future capital
	to continue to complete development and commercialize our products incorporating licensed technologies and technology candidates
	and to conduct the research and development and regulatory activities necessary to bring our technology candidates to market.


	 


	If we raise additional funds through licensing
	arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology candidates, or grant licenses on terms
	that are not favorable to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, we will reduce the
	percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders, and these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior
	to those of our existing stockholders.


	 




	Because our common stock may be a “penny
	stock,” it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock
	may be adversely affected.




	 


	Our common stock may be a “penny stock”
	if, among other things, the stock price is below $5.00 per share, it is not listed on a national securities exchange or it has
	not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers
	of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny
	stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser,
	orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination
	that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser’s written agreement to the purchase.
	Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such broker-dealer a monthly statement
	containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the
	penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back.


	 


	If applicable, the penny stock rules may make
	it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny
	stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Also, many brokers
	choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to resell their shares of
	our common stock publicly at times and prices that they feel are appropriate.

	ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
	ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



	 



	Overview



	 


	As noted above, on September 21, 2016, we closed
	a share exchange transaction (the “


	Transaction


	”) with EveryStory, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation
	(“


	EveryStory


	”) and the shareholders of EveryStory. Pursuant to the Transaction, we agreed that the Company’s
	prior operations and business would be sold off, and that the Company would focus on the EveryStory business and operations going
	forward. As such, historical descriptions of the Company’s operations and business are no longer included in this overview.


	 



	EveryStory Business and Platform



	 


	EveryStory is a secure, private, cloud-based
	story sharing platform (the “


	Platform


	”) that allows users to create collaborative, interactive that combine
	photos with unlimited audio, thereby permanently saving the photos and the stories behind the photos in digital form. Once the
	stories are recorded, they are safely and securely stored in the cloud where they can be privately shared with family and friends
	through the creation of private micro social networks. In the context of the family, EveryStory’s Platform allows families
	to create a living and growing family history and archive of family stories that is secure and can be safely kept on the cloud
	indefinitely. Likewise, for closely-knit groups of friends, the EveryStory Platform can provide a living chronicle of those friendships
	over the decades.


	 


	EveryStory’s technology Platform streamlines
	the creation of personalized digital stories, and management is focused on the goal of becoming the first clinically-proven Digital
	Therapeutic technology targeting patients with Alzheimer's disease and Dementia.

	EveryStory already
	has received a US patent (issued in 2010) that broadly covers the use of EveryStory’s technology in Senior Living facilities.

	EveryStory is in the final stages of preparation to run a clinical trial with UCSD showing that EveryStory is an effective
	anxiety reduction and quality of life therapy for those with Alzheimer’s disease or Dementia (“


	ADOD


	”).

	EveryStory conducts its operations from its
	facilities located in San Diego, California.


	 



	Plan of Operations



	 




	Revenue Model





	 




	Digital Therapeutics Business Model



	 



	Prior to the Closing
	of the Acquisition transaction with KMI, EveryStory had been in negotiations with the University of California at San Diego (“


	UCSD


	”)
	to conduct a clinical trial t

	o determine whether EveryStory and its Reminiscence Therapy and Digital Therapeutics technology
	and implementation techniques are an effective in reducing anxiety and as part of quality of life improvement therapy for those
	with Alzheimer’s disease or Dementia (“


	ADOD


	”).


	 



	Assuming that the
	results of the clinical trial match the anecdotal evidence that EveryStory has observed and experienced, once th

	e clinical
	trial has been completed and the data published, EveryStory intends to offer the Digital Therapeutics technology directly to the
	families of ADOD patients as a clinical supported therapy. Additionally, EveryStory intends to partner directly with Senior Living
	management firms, and to offer a revenue sharing arrangement for the patients and families of the Senior Living firms that chooses
	to implement the Therapy for their loved ones.


	 


	In both the direct-to-Patient and the Senior
	Living-management models, management anticipates that the product, which will include a digital tablet in the patient’s room,
	will cost approximately $20 per month, or $200 per year, per patient.


	 


	Additionally, EveryStory intends to find a
	partners outside of the US to commercialize the product to the Senior Living-type markets and other implementation techniques.


	 



	Results of Operations--Year Ended June 30,
	2016 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2015



	 


	As noted above, the information below relating
	to historical data for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, relate to the Company’s prior business and operations, which
	were terminated following the closing of the Transaction on September 21, 2016.


	 




	Gross Revenue


	. No revenue was

	compared to general and administrative expenses of $304,250 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the total general

	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Our management, with the participation of our
	prior principal executive and financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
	in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
	this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures
	required by Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act) were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us
	in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
	including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
	allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by the Report, we did not have a formal
	audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties.


	 


	We believe that a control system, no matter
	how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation
	of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.


	 



	Management’s Annual Report on Internal
	Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
	maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
	of our company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
	statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
	or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
	on the financial statements.


	 


	Management assessed our internal control over
	financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in

	Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
	COSO 2013 Criteria)

	. Management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness
	of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.


	 


	Based on our assessment, management has concluded
	that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, as of the end of the fiscal year, to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
	report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.


	 



	Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of
	Controls



	 


	Internal control over financial reporting has
	inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation
	of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors.
	Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in
	judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion
	or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
	or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process
	and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems
	determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
	of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There was no change in our internal control
	over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
	that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	On March 11, 2014, we entered into a consulting
	agreement effective January 1, 2014 with Northern New Hampshire Technical Associates LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Dave (“


	NHTA

	Under the consulting agreement, NHTA provides consulting services for us regarding Mr. Dave’s service as Chairman of the
	Science Advisory Board and other consulting services requested by our board of directors. The term of the consulting agreement
	is for twelve months from the effective date and is automatically extended by one additional year. We initially agreed to pay NHTA
	$2,500 per month under the consulting agreement including reimbursement for all travel, entertainment and other reasonable business
	expenses incurred by NHTA incident to services rendered to us. The consulting agreement also includes an indemnification provision
	applicable to both NHTA and Mr. Dave. Effective September 2014, this monthly reimbursement was increased to $6,000 in light of
	the fact that Dr. Dave has assumed additional responsibilities as President and CEO.

	This table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and principal stockholders and is believed to be accurate. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table, we believe that each of the stockholders named in this table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock subject to options, warrants, or other conversion privileges currently exercisable or convertible, or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the date of this table, are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person holding such option, warrant, or other convertible instrument but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person. Where more than one person has a beneficial ownership interest in the same shares, the sharing of beneficial ownership of these shares is designated in the footnotes to this table. As of October 7, 2016, we had 118,252,712 shares outstanding.






	 





	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
	TRANSACTIONS, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.



	 



	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions



	 


	On April 23, 2014, our board of directors approved
	the grant of 5,500,000 restricted shares to Mr. Dave for services with 1,833,333 shares vesting immediately and the remaining 3,666,667
	shares vesting at later dates. On July 9, 2014, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Science Advisory Board Agreement
	with Mr. Dave and all unvested shares for Mr. Dave became fully vested.


	 



	In January
	2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with Northern New Hampshire Technical Associates, a company owned and controlled by
	Mr. Dave, under which Mr. Dave performs services for us as an officer, director, and Science Advisory Board member for $6,000 per
	month plus travel and expense reimbursement. This contract was renewed August 1, 2014 for a one-year period with a one-year automatic
	extension.

	Effective September 16, 2016, we entered into a Termination and Settlement Agreement which terminated the consulting
	agreement and any amounts owing under the agreement were forgiven.


	 


	 






	 



	25



	 







	 




	 


	In August 2015, we entered into a management
	advisory agreement with Mountain Ranch Partners, Inc., a significant shareholder of the Company. The agreement was in effect for
	the period of August 2015 through May 2016 for $1,000 per month, during which time the Mountain Ranch Partners, Inc. provided
	services customarily needed by a public company contemplating an acquisition of a target company. Effective September 16, 2016,
	we entered into a Termination and Settlement Agreement which terminated the management advisory agreement. There were no fees
	outstanding under the agreement.


	 



	In January
	2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with Zephyr Equities, a company owned and operated by Valerie Vekkos, a significant
	shareholder and former director of the Company, under which Ms. Vekkos manages corporate organizational matters and day-to-day
	operations of the Company for $3,500 per month plus travel and expense reimbursements. This contract was renewed September 1,
	2014 for a one-year period with a one-year automatic extension.

	Effective September 16, 2016, we entered into a Termination
	and Settlement Agreement which terminated the consulting agreement and any amounts owing under the agreement were forgiven except
	for $35,000.


	 



	Director Independence



	 


	Our securities are not listed on a national
	securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that directors be independent. Therefore, we
	have adopted the independence standards of the American Stock Exchange, now known as the NYSE MKT LLC, to determine the independence
	of our directors and those directors serving on our committees. These standards provide that a person will be considered an independent
	director if he or she is not an officer of the company and is, in the view of the company’s board of directors, free of any
	relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Morgan
	meets this standard, and therefore, would be considered to be independent.



	 





	ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.



	 



	Audit Fee



	 


	The aggregate fees billed for each of the last
	two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statement
	and review of financial statements included in our 10-Q reports and services normally provided by the accountant in connection
	with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were $24,870 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and $29,242 for fiscal year
	ended June 30, 2015.


	 



	Audit-Related Fees



	 


	The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
	two fiscal years for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance
	of the audit or review of our financial statements that are not reported above were $0 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and
	$0 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.


	 



	Tax Fees



	 


	The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
	two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning
	were $0 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and $0 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.


	 



	All Other Fees



	 


	The aggregate fees billed in each of the last
	two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than the services reported above were $0
	for fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and $0 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.


	 



	Audit Committee



	 


	We do not have an audit committee currently
	serving and as a result our board of directors performs the duties of an audit committee. Our board of directors will evaluate
	and approve in advance, the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before the auditor renders audit and non-audit services.
	We do not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM


	 


	Board of Directors


	Knowledge Machine International, Inc.


	San Diego, CA


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Knowledge Machine International, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations,
	stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. The Company’s management is responsible for these
	financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
	in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the
	results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company
	has incurred losses since its inception, has a working capital deficit, and has not yet established profitable operations. These
	factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regards
	to these matters are also described in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of these uncertainties.

	KNOWLEDGE MACHINE INTERNATIONAL, INC.


	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	JUNE 30, 2016


	 



	NOTE 1 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies



	 



	Nature of Business

	– On September
	21, 2016, Knowledge Machine International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“we” or the “Company”), acquired
	a new operating subsidiary, EveryStory, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“


	EveryStory


	”). EveryStory offers
	a subscription-based service that captures, shares, and stores photos and audio in cloud. It offers the EveryStory platform, which
	enables users to preserve and share memories, and will initially target a Quality of Life benefit in certain patient populations,
	principally patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. As of the date of this Report, EveryStory was our only
	subsidiary. Additional information relating to the business and operations of EveryStory, which will become our business and operations,
	is given below. Prior to the closing of the EveryStory transaction, the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December
	27, 2012, to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of high end edged tools produced
	outside the US. We conducted this business through October 22, 2014. On October 22, 2014, we acquired an operating subsidiary,
	Knowledge Machine, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“


	Knowledge Machine


	”), which focused on new technologies,
	acquiring licensing rights to those technologies, and marketing the licensed technologies, and we sold off our edged tools business.
	In connection with the EveryStory transaction, we dissolved Knowledge Machine, and terminated the technology licensing and marketing
	operations.


	 


	The EveryStory transaction is discussed in
	more detail below in Note 7, Subsequent Events.


	 



	Basis of Presentation

	– The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with Article 8 of U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary
	to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, and for the periods
	then ended have been made.


	 



	Income Taxes –

	The Company
	accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”


	 


	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC
	Topic No. 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” at the date of inception on December 12, 2013. As a result of the implementation
	of ASC Topic No. 740, the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.


	 


	The Company has no tax positions at June
	30, 2016 or 2015, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
	such deductibility.


	 


	The Company recognizes interest accrued
	related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. During the years ended June 30, 2016
	and 2015, the Company recognized no interest and penalties. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at June 30,
	2016 or 2015. All tax years starting with 2013 are open for examination.


	 



	Stock Based Compensation

	–
	The Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under ASC Topic No. 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”
	Under ASC Topic No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based
	on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required
	to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance based awards,
	share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their
	fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.


	 


	Equity instruments issued other than to
	employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by ASC Topic No. 505, “Equity Based
	Payments to Non-Employees.” In general, the measurement date is when either (a) a performance commitment, as defined, is
	reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value
	related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined
	in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.


	 



	Loss Per Share –

	The computation
	of loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period in accordance with ASC Topic
	No. 260, “Earnings Per Share.”


	 



	Recently Enacted Accounting Standards

	– The FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (“

	Codification

	” or “

	ASC

	”)
	as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“

	GAAP

	”).
	Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“

	SEC

	”) issued under authority of
	federal securities laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.


	 


	 








	 


	F-

	6



	 







	 




	 


	 


	Recent Accounting Standards Updates (“

	ASU

	”)
	through ASU No. 2016-17 contain technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance to specialized industries. These
	updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.
	The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2014-10 “Development Stage Entities” which generally removes the
	requirements for added disclosures about development stage activities.


	 



	Cash Equivalents

	- The Company considers
	all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.


	 



	Concentration of Credit Risk

	–
	The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has
	not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.


	 



	Accounting Estimates

	- The preparation
	of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to
	make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from those estimated by management.


	 



	Reclassification

	– Certain
	prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. The Company has concluded that
	it was appropriate to classify Deferred Compensation, representing unvested stock issued to management and consultants, as a Prepaid
	Expense rather than Equity. Accordingly, the Company has revised the classification to report Deferred Compensation under the Current
	Asset Prepaid Expenses captain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This change in classification does not affect the previously
	reported Consolidated Statements of Operations or Cash Flows.


	 



	NOTE 2 – Going Concern



	 


	The Company has not yet achieved
	profitable operations. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on expanding income
	opportunities. Management anticipates that the implementation of the EveryStory business plans and operations will allow the
	Company to achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional
	capital or in achieving profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of these uncertainties.


	 



	NOTE 3 – Other Assets



	 



	Allotrope Sciences
	Corporation



	 


	In June 2014, the Company entered into
	a Stock Purchase Agreement with Allotrope Sciences Corporation, a Delaware corporation controlled by the Company’s President
	and CEO, to purchase 12% of the total number of shares of Allotrope’s common stock for $150,000. Three payment installments
	of $50,000 each were due within 10, 30 and 90 business days of the signing of the agreement on June 23, 2014, on which dates 4%
	increments of Allotrope’s common stock were deliverable to the Company. The first payment of $50,000 was made and 4% of Allotrope
	stock was delivered to the Company prior to June 30, 2014. The payment was initially recorded as a cost-method investment and impaired
	to $0 at June 30, 2014. The two remaining payments totaling $100,000 were never made and corresponding stock never issued, and
	on October 14, 2014, the Company and Allotrope rescinded the original agreement.

	On July 8, 2014, the Company and Score
	Technologies, Inc. entered into a Subscription Agreement for the purchase of 100,000 shares of common stock of Score (the “

	Shares

	”)
	by the Company for the sum of $50,000. The Company paid the $50,000, but never received the Shares. On August 4, 2014, the Company
	and Score entered into a Rescission Agreement whereby all transactions contemplated by the Option Agreement, as disclosed below,
	were rescinded. The parties also agreed that Score would retain the $50,000 payment made by the Company pursuant to the Option
	Agreement and apply the payment to the first payment required to be made by the Company to Score in connection with the first license
	agreement between the parties. In addition, the parties agreed that if a license agreement was not entered into by February 15,
	2015, Score would be required to repay to the Company the $50,000 payment, in cash, by no later than February 18, 2015. At June
	30 2015, the Company determined to terminate their dealings with Score due to Score’s nonperformance, and impaired the deposit
	to $0. As of June 30, 2016, the $50,000 had not been returned.


	 


	On July 2, 2014, the Company entered into
	an Option Agreement with Score wherein the Company paid a total of $25,000 for the option of entering into a license agreement.
	On January 6, 2015, the Company notified Score that it is terminating the exclusive option to enter into a license agreement for
	India and demanding return of the $25,000 paid to Score. The termination of the option was based upon Score’s failure to
	produce to the Company the consumer marketable SCOREISPAPP referred to in the agreements. At June 30, 2015, the Company impaired
	the deposit to $0, and at June 30, 2016, the $25,000 had not been returned.

	Prepaid Expenses



	 


	Prepaid expenses consist of $4,334 and
	$4,584 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in deferred stock compensation (NOTE 5) that vests according to underlying contracts,
	and $309 and $4,535 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in prepaid insurance that is amortized ratably over the term of January
	20, 2015 through January 20, 2017.


	 



	NOTE 4 – Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes in
	accordance with ASC Topic No. 740. This standard requires the Company to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to
	the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences between book and tax accounting methods and any available
	operating loss or tax credit carryforwards.


	 


	The Company has available at June 30, 2016
	and 2015, unused operating loss carryforwards of approximately $795,798 and $565,161, respectively, which may be applied against
	future taxable income and which expire in various years through 2035. However, if certain substantial changes in the Company’s
	ownership should occur, there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforward which can be utilized.
	The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent,
	in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the future earnings of the Company and other future events, the effects of which cannot be
	determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards, the Company has established a valuation
	allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss carryfowards of approximately $99,211 and $64,615 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
	and therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance is approximately
	$34,596 and $45,650, respectively, for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	Deferred tax assets are comprised
	of the following:

	NOTE 5 – Stockholders’ Equity



	 




	Common
	Stock


	 


	 


	The Company has authorized 200,000,000
	shares of common stock, $0.001 par value.


	 


	In February, March and April 2014, the
	Company issued 22,500,000 shares to officers and investors for cash of $22,500, or $0.001 per share.


	 



	On
	April 22, 2014, the Company issued 11,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company’s Science Advisory
	Board members as noncash compensation for services to be rendered valued at $11,500 or $0.001 per share. Of these shares, 3,831,999
	(valued at $3,832) vested during the period ended June 30, 2014 and 7,668,001 (valued at $7,668) remained unvested and were reflected
	as prepaid expenses as of June 30, 2014.

	 

	On August 13, 2014,
	250,000 shares previously issued to a Science Advisory Board member were cancelled, 83,000 of which had previously vested and 167,000
	were unvested. The shares were valued at $0.001, or $250. An additional 3,666,667 shares (valued at $3,667) vested during the three
	months ended September 30, 2014 and 3,834,334 (valued at $3,834) remain unvested and are reflected as prepaid expenses as of June
	30, 2016. On August 19, 2016, the 3,834,334 unvested shares were cancelled and returned to treasury for nonperformance and in anticipation
	of the EveryStory, Inc. Transaction (NOTE 7).




	 



	On July 29, 2014, $575,000 of convertible
	notes payable were extinguished via issuance of 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a rate of $0.20 per share. The shares were
	recorded at $0.001, or $2,875. The balance of $572,125 was recorded as additional paid in capital.


	 


	 


	 








	 


	F-

	On August 25, 2014, the Company issued
	1,000,000 shares of common stock to a Director. The shares were valued at $0.001, or $1,000. Of these shares, 250,000 (valued at
	$250) vested during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and another 250,000 (valued at $250) vested during the quarter ended September
	30, 2015. 500,000 (valued at $500) remain unvested. 250,000 shares will vest each year on August 25 in 2016 and 2017 as long as
	the individual remains as a Director of the Company. The unvested shares are reflected as prepaid expenses at June 30, 2016. On
	August 19, 2016, all 1,000,000 shares were cancelled and returned to treasury for nonperformance and in anticipation of the EveryStory,
	Inc. Transaction (NOTE 7).


	 


	On October 22, 2014, the Company issued
	1,000,000 shares of common stock as part of a reorganization of the Company.


	 


	On November 10, 2014, a ten-for-one forward
	stock split occurred on 1,000,000 shares of Songbird Development, Inc. acquired in the reverse merger and reorganization (see NOTE
	1), resulting in an additional 9,000,000 shares being issued. The split has been retroactively applied to all periods presented
	and does not affect any of the stock issuances described above.


	 




	Deferred
	Compensation


	 


	 



	During
	the period ended June 30, 2014, 11,500,000 shares of common stock were issued to the Company’s Science Advisory Board members
	at $0.001 per share.

	 

	The unvested portion of the shares at
	June 30, 2014 (7,668,001 unvested shares) increased prepaid expenses by $7,668. During the three months ended September 30, 2014,
	167,000 of the unvested shares were cancelled, and an additional 3,666,667 shares vested. The unvested number of shares at June
	30, 2016 is 3,834,334, representing prepaid expenses of $3,834.



	 


	During the three months ended September
	30, 2014, 1,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to a Director at $0.001 per share. The unvested portion of the shares at
	June 30, 2016 (500,000 unvested shares) increased prepaid expenses by $500.


	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the balance of unvested
	compensation cost expected to be recognized is $4,334 and is recorded as a prepaid expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
	The unvested compensation is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately two years (through August
	25, 2017).


	 



	Preferred Stock



	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000
	shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value.


	 


	On May 13, 2016, the Company commenced
	a non-public offering of up to 150,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “

	Series A Shares

	”) at $0.80 per
	Series A Share to be sold pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “

	Private
	Offering

	”). The Series A Shares are convertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock (“

	Common Shares

	”)
	at any time as desired by the holder at a conversion rate of 80 Common Shares for each Series A Share converted, subject to adjustments
	in the event of stock splits, recapitalizations, or similar events, provided that the Series A Shares will not be adjusted for
	any reverse stock split for a period of one year from the filing date of the Certificate of Designation creating the series, which
	occurred on June 20, 2016. At June 30, 2016, the Company had sold 47,500 Series A Shares for gross proceeds of $38,000. During
	the period of July 1, 2016 until the closing of the Private Offering, the Company sold 52,500 Series A Shares for gross proceeds
	of $42,000, for a total of 100,000 Series A Shares issued for $80,000 gross proceeds.


	 


	The conversion option embedded within the
	Series A Shares is a derivative that qualifies for permanent equity treatment, with total proceeds allocated to a beneficial conversion
	feature (the “

	BCF

	”). The BCF and related discount were offsetting entries to additional paid-in capital.

	NOTE 7 – Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company has evaluated subsequent events
	from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and determined there are the following items
	to disclose:


	 




	Entry into Amended and Restated Acquisition
	and Share Exchange Agreement; Completion of Acquisition of Assets




	 


	On September 21, 2016, the Company entered
	into an Amended and Restated Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement (the “

	A&R Agreement

	”) with EveryStory,
	Inc., a Delaware corporation (“

	EveryStory

	”), and each of its shareholder (the “

	Shareholders

	”),
	and closed the acquisition (the “

	Acquisition

	”) of the ownership of EveryStory (the “

	Closing

	”).


	 


	Pursuant to the A&R Agreement, the
	Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of EveryStory, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 77,377,712 shares of the Company’s
	common stock to the EveryStory holders, with the understanding that an additional 45,247,288 shares were to be reserved for issuance
	to holders of EveryStory derivative securities which are convertible or exercisable into shares of EveryStory common stock (collectively,
	the “

	Exchange Shares

	”). Additionally, prior to Closing, the parties agreed that certain shares of the Company’s
	common stock were to be returned to the Company for cancellation, resulting in the current Company’s shareholders owning
	an aggregate of 40,875,000 shares of the Company’s common stock immediately prior to the Closing.


	 


	Pursuant to the A&R Agreement, the
	122,625,000 Exchange Shares issued or to be issued to the EveryStory constituted 75% of the total issued and outstanding shares
	of the Company’s common stock, and the legacy Company shareholders (who were the owners of the Company’s common stock
	immediately prior to the Closing) owned an aggregate of 40,875,000 shares, which constituted 25% of the total outstanding Company
	common stock.


	 


	The Company’s and EveryStory’s
	management agreed, and the A&R Agreement provides, that following the Closing, the Company will conduct a reverse stock split
	(discussed in more detail below), following which the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock will convert
	into a total of 8,000,000 post-reverse-split common stock. Following such conversion, the EveryStory owners will own or have the
	right to receive shares of the Company’s common stock equal to 60% of the then-outstanding Company common stock, and the
	Company legacy shareholders will own shares of the Company’s common stock equal to 40% of the then-outstanding Company common
	stock, consisting of 8,000,000 shares of Company common stock issued on conversion of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock
	(20%) and 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the other legacy Company shareholders (20%).


	 


	As a result of the Closing of the A&R
	Agreement, EveryStory became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Additionally, the directors and officers of the Company
	immediately prior to the Closing appointed the EveryStory management to become officers and directors of the Company, and then
	resigned from their positions with the Company. In addition, the Company terminated its pre-Closing business operations and agreed
	to dissolve its other wholly owned subsidiary, Knowledge Machine, Inc.


	 



	Share Ownership
	Following Closing




	 



	Prior to Closing, the Company had 40,875,000
	shares of its common stock outstanding. Upon Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of 77,377,712 shares of its common stock
	to the then current shareholders of EveryStory. Additionally, at Closing, EveryStory had options to issue a total of 600,000 shares
	of its common stock, and convertible debt securities that would be convertible into 672,533 shares of EveryStory’s common
	stock. In connection with the Closing, the Company agreed to reserve an aggregate of 45,247,288 shares of its common stock for
	issuance in connection with the future exchange of shares of EveryStory common stock issued upon exercise of EveryStory options
	or conversion of EveryStory convertible debt securities.


	 




	Closing of Convertible Note Offering






	 




	The Company conducted a private offering
	of convertible notes (the “

	Note Offering

	”) to raise additional capital that would remain in the Company following
	the Closing. In the convertible note offering, the Company raised an aggregate of $240,000, which will be a component of the post-Closing
	capitalization of the Company. In the Note Offering, investors entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “

	Note
	SPA

	”) and were issued a convertible redeemable promissory note (collectively, the “

	Convertible Note

	”).
	Pursuant to the terms of the Note SPA, each investor represented and warranted that it was an accredited investor and that he or
	she was purchasing the Convertible Note for his or her own account, and not with a view to distribution, as well as other standard
	representations made in private transactions. Also pursuant to the Note SPA, the Company has the right to put an additional Convertible
	Note (in the same principal amount as purchased by the applicable investor) beginning on January 3, 2017, subject to certain conditions.
	The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 10%, and mature on September 13, 2017, if not converted or prepaid prior to that.
	The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.195, subject
	to adjustment as described in the Convertible Note. Up to 50% of the Convertible Notes may be repaid by the Company any time prior
	to 180 days after the issuance of the Convertible Notes, with a 30% premium to be paid in connection with the prepayment.


	 


	 








	 


	F-

	10



	 







	 




	 


	Based on the terms of the Convertible Notes,
	absent any adjustment of the conversion price, the Company could be required to issue up to 1,230,769 shares of the Company’s
	common stock if the entire principal amounts of the Convertible Notes were converted. The Company could be required to issue additional
	shares of its common stock if interest accruing on the Convertible Notes is converted into shares (on the same formula as that
	of the Convertible Notes), although the Company cannot determine how many shares could be issued until such conversions occur.


	 




	Change in Control






	 




	Immediately prior to the Closing, there
	were 40,875,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In connection with the Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of
	77,377,712 shares to the EveryStory shareholders, and 45,247,288 shares were reserved for issuance to the holders of EveryStory
	options and convertible debt instruments, and the parties to the A&R Agreement understand and anticipate that all such holders
	would exercise and convert their securities into the reserved shares of the Company.


	 


	As noted, once


	 







	·



	the Reverse Split has taken place;









	·



	all of the Company’s convertible preferred shares are converted into shares of the Company’s
	common stock;









	·



	all of the EveryStory convertible notes are converted into shares of EveryStory common stock and
	then exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock; and









	·



	all of the EveryStory options have been exercised into shares of EveryStory common stock and then
	exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock,




	 


	then the legacy Company shareholders would
	own 40%, and the EveryStory shareholders and option and convertible debt holders would collectively own 60%. As of the date of
	this Report, the Company’s management is unaware of any agreements between the EveryStory shareholders, the EveryStory option
	holders, the EveryStory convertible debt holders, or anyone else to work together. Nevertheless, numerically, the EveryStory securities
	holders do or will own more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, and as such, a change of control could be
	deemed to have occurred.


	 




	Termination and Settlement Agreements




	 


	Effective September 16, 2016, the Company
	entered into Settlement and Termination Agreements with Mountain Ranch Partners, Inc., New Hampshire Technical Associates, LLC,
	and Zephyr Equities, Inc., respectively, which terminated existing consulting agreements with each of the entities (see NOTE 8).
	Under the Settlement and Termination Agreements, all outstanding amounts owed to each entity were forgiven except for $35,000 owed
	to Zephyr Equities, which was paid on September 26, 2016.


	 



	NOTE 8 - Related Party Transactions



	 



	In
	January 2014, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Northern New Hampshire Technical Associates, a company owned
	and controlled by the Company’s President/CEO, under which the President/CEO performs services for the Company as an officer,
	director, and Science Advisory Board member for $6,000 per month plus travel and expense reimbursement. This contract was renewed
	August 1, 2014 for a one-year period with a one-year automatic extension. Also in January 2014, the Company entered into a consulting
	agreement with Zephyr Equities, a company owned and operated by a significant shareholder and former director of the Company, under
	which Zephyr Equities manages corporate organizational matters and day-to-day operations of the Company for $3,500 per month plus
	travel and expense reimbursements. This contract was renewed September 1, 2014 for a one-year period with a one-year automatic
	extension. The Company also pays monthly rent of $750 to Zephyr Equities. In August 2015, the Company entered into a management
	advisory agreement with Mountain Ranch Partners, Inc., a significant common and preferred shareholder of the Company, whereby Mountain
	Green Partners, Inc. would seek out companies that would be potential acquisition targets for the Company. This contract was in
	effect for the period of August 2015 through May 2016.




	 




	The
	Company incurred a total expense of $133,900 with these consultants and made repayments of $20,100 during the year ended

	June
	30

	, 2016. In addition, these consultants paid expenses of $11,189 on behalf of the Company
	for a net increase of $124,989. The Company incurred a total expense of $126,683 with these consultants and made repayments of
	$78,483 during the year ended

	June 30

	, 2015 (net increase of $48,200). Of the expenses
	incurred, $181,989 and $57,000 were outstanding at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this Offering. 
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. 

The figures above represent only estimated costs. 

Our offering expenses of approximately $7,000 are comprised primarily of legal
and accounting expenses, publishing/Edgarization fees, SEC filing fees and
transfer agent fees. Our officers and directors will not receive any
compensation for their efforts in selling our shares.
 
If we are able to sell only 1,500,000, shares (75% of this offering) we can
maintain our reporting requirements with the SEC and complete the development of
our business to distribute High End Cutlery Sets, with the exception that we
will have insufficient funds to hire a sales person. If we are not able to sell
a minimum of 500,000 shares (25% of this offering), we will not implement our
business plan at all, except maintaining our reporting with the SEC and remain
in good standing with the state of Nevada. If we do not sell at least 500,000
shares (25% of this offering) we will not be able to maintain our reporting
status with the SEC, remain in good standing with the state of Nevada and
complete most of our website development. If we are unable to complete the
Maximum Offering of 2,000,000 shares, we will attempt to raised the funds needed
to complete our Plan of Operation through equity financing, debt financing, or
other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our
shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of developing our website
www.songbirddevelopment.com are greater than we have budgeted. Our website is
currently in the process of development. We will also require additional
financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning
revenues.
 
We currently do not have any arrangements regarding this Offering or following
this Offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing
when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further
financing, the successful development of our High End Cutlery Sets products
business, a successful marketing and promotion program, and achieving a
profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by
us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be
available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are
no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our
continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be
available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated
sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional
financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.

If we are successful in selling all 2,000,000 shares of common stock under this
Offering, the net proceeds will be used for our business plan and general
working capital, during the twelve months following the successful completion of
this Offering. In all instances, after the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, we will require some amount of
working capital to maintain our basic operations and comply with our public
reporting obligations. In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of
the amount of proceeds received, we may change the use of proceeds because of
changes in our business plan. Investors should understand that we have wide
discretion over the use of proceeds.


There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and retail sales
companies selling High End Cutlery Sets products. We expect to face medium to
high level of resistance when we enter the market, where it will be up to our
marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Most of our
competitors have greater financial resources and may be able to withstand sales
or price decreases well than we can. We also expect to continue to face
competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete
effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
High End Cutlery Sets are distributed by many companies as well as numerous
stores and websites in Europe and North America. To compete with other
companies, we plan is to use helpful customer service and offer a wide
assortment of High End Cutlery Sets at competitive prices. We will take
significant efforts to promote our product using marketing and internet tools.


Company Description
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 27, 2012 to 
engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the 
distribution of high end cutlery sets produced in China. 
---

We are in the early stages of developing our plan to distribute high end cutlery
sets of


 different types: stainless steel cutlery, ceramic cutlery, etc. made in
China. We entered into the Agreements with Chinese manufacturers ADA KITCHENWARE
INDUSTRIAL & TRADING CO., LTD and also with KITCHENSMITH CO., LTD., who will 
supply the high end cutlery sets products to our company. We currently have 
$45,830 in revenues, a limited operating history, and have limited orders to 
purchase the high end cutlery sets. Our plan of operations over the 12 month 
period following successful completion of our offering is to develop and 
establish our high end cutlery sets distribution business and hire one 
salesperson. We currently have high end cutlery sets available, but do not 
expect to be actively selling the products in an amount to sustain or business 
operations at a level we want until the completion of this offering. 

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, entering
into Agreements with our suppliers, purchasing first samples and commercial sets
available for sale, finding a website developer who is currently in the process
of developing our company`s website and the initial equity funding by our sole
officer and director. We have generated $45,830 in revenues to date and our
principal business activities to date consist of creating a business plan and
entering into a Supply Agreements, dated July 3, 2013, with ADA KITCHENWARE Imp
& Exp Co., Ltd., and dated June 30, 2013 with KITCHENSMITH Co. LTD, Chinese
companies (“ADA KITCHENWARE” and “KITCHENSMITH”), which are established
distributors of high end cutlery products. Both ADA KITCHENWARE and KITCHENSMITH
are large and well-established manufacturers and distributors of high end
cutlery sets in China. The terms and conditions of the Supply Agreements provide
that we have the right to purchase products at the item`s market prices as
identified in the Supply Agreements.
---

Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Dnipropetrovska Doroha, Apt. 
110, Odesa, Ukraine 65000. Our phone number is (415) 735-6610. In October 2013 
we signed a one year lease for office space located at 5803 SE Gladstone Street,
Portland, OR 97206. This site will serve as our U.S. shipping site and after we 
obtain funding we will obtain the necessary office equipment to set up the 
office for further operations. In January 2014 we purchased an office in Odesa, 
Ukraine to address the growing interest in our products in the European market. 
We also purchase a delivery truck which will allow us to deliver product which 
may be ordered in Europe. We are a development stage company, we only just 
completed our first fiscal year end on July 31, 2013 and we have no 
subsidiaries. Our website: www.songbirddevelopment.com.
