Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2017, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Fund’s Distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses for Class A shares at 1.15%, Class E shares at 1.15%, Class I shares at 0.88%, and Class Y shares at 1.06%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IICO, IDI, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through October 31, 2017, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (WRIMCO), the Fund’s investment manager, Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell & Reed), the Fund’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses as follows: Class A shares at 2.31%, Class B shares at 2.12%, Class C shares at 0.87%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2017, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Fund’s Distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses for Class A shares at 1.15%, Class E shares at 1.15%, Class I shares at 0.88%, and Class Y shares at 1.06%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IICO, IDI, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
