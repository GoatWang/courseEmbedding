An excellent job to boost your career.ConsIf you are part of the finance department, it means an understaffed department that works long hours to comply to unrealistic deadlines and crazy assignments that are usually given 5 minutes before leaving home and must be completed by 9 AM the next day. Basically no work/life balance at all. The finance department will rather do all the work in a Project even if it is not within their responsibility just because "we do things better" meaning we do the long hours and all the other departments gets the credit.Advice to ManagementMy advice is to really evaluate the upper management not only in terms of fulfilling their job goals within the deadline but also to keep a happy/balanced workplace.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Pacific Airport Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Pacific Airport Group 2014-08-25 17:48 PDTReviews > Pacific Airport Group RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedCSX ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 570 ReviewsXPO Logistics ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,180 ReviewsUnion Pacific ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 797 ReviewsPostmates ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 757 ReviewsRyder System ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 814 ReviewsPenske Truck Leasing ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 504 ReviewsCarnival ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 531 ReviewsAlaska Airlines ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 295 Reviews Related Job SearchFlight Attendant jobsFlight Attendant salaries ($36k)Driver jobsDriver salaries ($31k)Locomotive Engineer jobsLocomotive Engineer salaries ($89k)Assistant Conductor jobsAssistant Conductor salaries ($44k)Airport Operations Crew Member jobsAirport Operations Crew Member salaries ($25k)Account Manager jobsAccount Manager salaries ($52k)Pilot jobsPilot salaries ($80k)Conductor jobsConductor salaries ($60k)Customer Service Representative jobsCustomer Service Representative salaries ($25k)Logistics Account Executive jobsLogistics Account Executive salaries ($36k)Customer Service Agent jobsCustomer Service Agent salaries ($22k)Sales Representative jobsSales Representative salaries ($39k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
