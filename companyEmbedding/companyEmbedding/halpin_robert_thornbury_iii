Robert Thornbury Halpin Sr.


Obituary
Condolences


































  Halpin, Sr., Robert Thornbury Robert Thornbury Halpin, Sr. passed from this life on June 13, 2011 after a brief illness. He was born June 30, 1927 in Montclair, New Jersey. He graduated from Montclair High School in 1945 and immediately enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. After honorably completing his military service in 1946, Bob enrolled at Colgate University where he earned a degree in Geology in 1950. Bob spent the next 60 years working in the oil and gas business, a profession he truly loved. He worked in partnership with Jon Cobb and John Morey as HCM for over 34 years. Up until his final illness he could be found riding his bike through the Park Cities to and from his office. He was also an avid tennis fan, not only playing the game his entire life, but also traveling to the site of every Grand Slam event. Bob is survived by his wife Marilyn, his three children and their spouses, Mollie and Bob Halpin, Jr., Terry and John Halpin III, and Betsy and Glenn Mortimer III, and their mother Evelyn "Honey" Halpin. He is also survived by his daughter and her spouse Elizabeth and Sam McLamb III. One of Bob's greatest joys was sharing in the lives of his 11 grandchildren and their spouses and his 6 great grandchildren. Bob could be counted on to visit every school attended by his grandchildren and made every graduation event. He was also an avid supporter of Highland Park and rarely missed a Scot's sporting event. His grandchildren are Haylie and Bert Crouch, Andrée and Robert Halpin III, Patrick Halpin, Hunter Halpin, Loren and Shane Zerr, Katie and Ben Alexander, Jamie Wilson, Callie Mortimer, Glenn Mortimer IV, Sam McLamb IV and Eleanor McLamb. Bob's great grandchildren are Caitlyn and Hadden Crouch, Taylor and Colton Zerr and Lauren and Jack Alexander. Bob is also survived by his brother Jack Halpin and spouse Joanne, his brother Bill Halpin and partner Calvin Temenski, his sister in law and spouse Jean and John Casey, his sister in law Bobbe Tipton and several nieces and nephews. The family would like to thank the medical staff at Presbyterian Hospital Hamon Tower 3rd Floor ICU for their compassionate care. A Memorial Service celebrating Bob's life will be held at Saint Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, June, 16th. In lieu of flowers the family requests contributions to be made to a Saint Michael's outreach project, Jubilee Park and Community Center (907 Bank Street, Dallas, TX 75223), or the Highland Park Sports Club (4233 Grassmere, Dallas, TX 75205), or to the Geology Department at Colgate University (Gift Records Department, 13 Oak Drive, Hamilton, New York 13346), or to the charity of your choice.
