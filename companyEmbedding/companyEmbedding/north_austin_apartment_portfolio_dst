Have you ever thought about selling your investment real estate?


Are you getting a little tired of managing your apartment building, duplex, or office building -- or are you thinking that the time is right to sell your land? Maybe you’re not selling because you think you’d have to pay an onerous amount of capital gains tax on the sale. Maybe you’re wondering what other investment could possibly offer you the high returns you enjoy now.


	 



Fortunately, there is an exciting, effective solution to this dilemma.


Section 1031 of the IRS tax code makes it possible for you to sell your current investment property and, within a strict time frame, buy management-free real estate investment without paying any capital gains taxes. It’s commonly called a "1031 Exchange," and it can be a financial lifesaver.
 The trouble can be, though, HOW do you find a suitable replacement property (one with the right purchase price, debt ratio, and closing schedule) within the 45-day time frame mandated by the 1031 Exchange requirements? HOW do you navigate all the paperwork involved without accidentally overlooking an IRS regulation or deadline? And finally, HOW do you find a replacement property that requires less management from you?
 



1031Property.com can help you overcome all three of these challenges.


1031Property.com specializes in helping people like you to find replacement property within the IRS time constraints. We can assist you to identify and "exchange into" a higher quality property than what you currently own, yet with no management responsibility for you. How can we do so? We connect you with multiple product specialists for whatever investment type you are looking for. We have been in business since 2002 and have established relationships with the top experts in the 1031 industry. We screen all our affiliates based upon reputation & experience so you don’t have to.




What is a 1031 Exchange?


In a “1031 Exchange” the IRS allows a property owner to sell one property and (using 100% of the proceeds from the sale) buy another property without tax consequence; that is, paying no capital gains taxes on the transaction. (This transaction is authorized by “Section 1031” of the IRS code.) It’s one of the best possible strategies for deferring the capital gains tax that would ordinarily arise from the sale of real estate, as it can provide real estate owners with greater leverage, increased diversification, improved cash flow, increased potential for geographic relocation, and potential property consolidation.

Top 10 Advantages of 1031 Exchanges




1031 Exchange Options


IRC Section 1031 requires that the new (replacement) property qualify as property held for use in a trade or business or for investment. For real property exchanges, there are a number of alternative investment options beyond the acquisition conventional direct management.


Fractional Ownership 1031 Exchange Options


         DST Investments – All Asset Classes Available

Managed Sole Ownership 1031 Exchange Options

         Private Exchanges – Passive Sole Ownership
         Single Family Homes - All Cash or Leveraged



1031 Exchange Rules


Once an Exchanger closes on the sale of an investment property he or she must identify a possible replacement for the relinquished property within 45 days as outlined by the 1031 exchange period. The 1031 exchange time limits and IRS Rules of section 1031 are outlined in Rev Proc 2002-22. The basic 1031 exchange rules involve the 1031 exchange time limit, 1031 exchange identification, like kind exchange rules, and how to designate property for a 1031 commercial exchange. When choosing a replacement property for the 1031 exchange the owner must follow one of the following three 1031 Exchange rules:

1. The “three-property” 1031 exchange rule: the owner may identify up to three properties, regardless of their value.

2. The “200 percent” 1031 exchange rule: the owner may identify any number of 1031 replacement properties as long as the combined fair market value (FMV) of those properties does not exceed 200% of the FMV of all sold properties.

3. The “95 percent” 1031 exchange rule: The owner may identify any number of 1031 exchange properties no matter the aggregate FMV, as long as 95% of the value of those identified 1031 exchange properties is acquired.

	In all cases of a 1031 exchange, the owner must close on the identified replacement property(s) within 180 days from the sale date of the original property.

1031 Exchange Requirements


To fully defer all capital gain taxes, a 1031 exchanger must meet four 1031 Exchange requirements:


1. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must reinvest a 100% of sale proceeds. If a 1031 exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property, the balance received is considered "cash boot," and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount.

2 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt. If a 1031 exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt, he or she is relieved of a debt obligation, and this is called a "mortgage boot." The IRS considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the 1031 exchanger; therefore, it is taxable, unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase.

3. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must use a “qualified 1031 intermediary” (also known as a “1031 facilitator” or “1031 accommodator”) to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed. The “qualified 1031 intermediary” (QI) acts as the “middle-man” in the 1031 exchange, providing the paperwork, oversight, escrow services, and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a 1031 Exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. Even though a 1031 Exchange is a complicated process, a 1031 Exchange using a good QI can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale.

4. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The new investment must be in “like-kind” property. IRS 1031 Exchange rules require the 1031 exchange of "like-kind" relinquished property for other "like-kind" replacement property. This doesn’t mean, though, that 1031 exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property. Bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property. Any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a 1031 Exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business.

What is a qualified 1031 intermediary?


A qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a 1031 exchange. The taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary. Most intermediaries are affiliated with banks, trust companies, or title companies. Using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a 1031 exchange. Essentially, the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property. These are simple documents that the attorney fills out, along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary. Through these three documents, the intermediary is brought into the 1031 exchange and, subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below, the transaction can qualify as a 1031 exchange rather than a taxable sale.

Ensure Your 1031 Exchange Facilitator is Fully Qualified


      Meets the "safe harbor" requirements of a "qualified intermediary" to pass a passes a possible IRS                 audit.

      Is an independent facilitator. This ensures you can work with the closing agent of your choice.

      Is a 1031 exchange expert with an understanding of how the exchange process works

      Is available as a resource to your accountant and attorney.

      Audit proof. Every 1031 exchange transaction needs to hold up to the scrutiny of the IRS.

The 1031 Exchange Process in 4 easy steps


There are several types of 1031 exchanges, the process is different for each type. These are the steps for the most common type of 1031 exchange, a delayed exchange.
	Delayed Exchange - Property is sold and replacement property is purchased within 180 days. Replacement property must be identified within 45 days. Because of the 180 day window this is the most popular type of 1031 exchange.

STEP 1 - PLAN THE TRANSACTION. Talk with your Qualified Intermediary to discuss your transaction. After listening to your investment objectives we'll determine the best way to structure your transaction. We'll estimate the amount of potential capital gains taxes you'll save.

STEP 2 - PURCHASE & SALE AGREEMENT. The exchange often begins with a standard purchase and sale agreement. The agreement should contain language which establishes the exchanger's intent to exchange and obtains the buyers consent to cooperate. Your Qualified Intermediary will convert this "sale" transaction into an exchange with the use of specialized documentation.

STEP 3 - RELINQUISHED PROPERTY. Once you have decided to perform an exchange contact Qualified Intermediary immediately. Also notify all parties to the transaction of your intent to exchange, including your real estate agent, closing agent, accountant and attorney. Your Qualified Intermediary will collect the information needed to prepare the exchange documents. The originals will be forwarded to the closing agent for execution at closing. Copes are sent to all parties for review. At closing the exchanger will transfer the relinquished property to Qualified Intermediary and Qualified Intermediary will simultaneously sell the property to the buyer. The proceeds are then paid the Qualified Intermediary and held for the acquisition of the replacement property.

STEP 4 - REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. After closing the relinquished property, the exchanger has 45 days to identify the replacement property and 180 days to complete the exchange. The exchanger notifies Qualified Intermediary once they have entered into an agreement to purchase the replacement property. Qualified Intermediary will deliver the documents needed to complete the exchange to the closing agent. At closing, the property is purchased by Qualified Intermediary and transferred to the exchanger. The exchange is now complete.

Have you ever thought about selling your investment real estate?


Are you getting a little tired of managing your apartment building, duplex, or office building -- or are you thinking that the time is right to sell your land? Maybe you’re not selling because you think you’d have to pay an onerous amount of capital gains tax on the sale. Maybe you’re wondering what other investment could possibly offer you the high returns you enjoy now.


	 



Fortunately, there is an exciting, effective solution to this dilemma.


Section 1031 of the IRS tax code makes it possible for you to sell your current investment property and, within a strict time frame, buy management-free real estate investment without paying any capital gains taxes. It’s commonly called a "1031 Exchange," and it can be a financial lifesaver.
 The trouble can be, though, HOW do you find a suitable replacement property (one with the right purchase price, debt ratio, and closing schedule) within the 45-day time frame mandated by the 1031 Exchange requirements? HOW do you navigate all the paperwork involved without accidentally overlooking an IRS regulation or deadline? And finally, HOW do you find a replacement property that requires less management from you?
 



1031Property.com can help you overcome all three of these challenges.


1031Property.com specializes in helping people like you to find replacement property within the IRS time constraints. We can assist you to identify and "exchange into" a higher quality property than what you currently own, yet with no management responsibility for you. How can we do so? We connect you with multiple product specialists for whatever investment type you are looking for. We have been in business since 2002 and have established relationships with the top experts in the 1031 industry. We screen all our affiliates based upon reputation & experience so you don’t have to.




What is a 1031 Exchange?


In a “1031 Exchange” the IRS allows a property owner to sell one property and (using 100% of the proceeds from the sale) buy another property without tax consequence; that is, paying no capital gains taxes on the transaction. (This transaction is authorized by “Section 1031” of the IRS code.) It’s one of the best possible strategies for deferring the capital gains tax that would ordinarily arise from the sale of real estate, as it can provide real estate owners with greater leverage, increased diversification, improved cash flow, increased potential for geographic relocation, and potential property consolidation.

Top 10 Advantages of 1031 Exchanges




1031 Exchange Options


IRC Section 1031 requires that the new (replacement) property qualify as property held for use in a trade or business or for investment. For real property exchanges, there are a number of alternative investment options beyond the acquisition conventional direct management.


Fractional Ownership 1031 Exchange Options


         DST Investments – All Asset Classes Available

Managed Sole Ownership 1031 Exchange Options


         Single Tenant NNN Property
         Private Exchanges – Passive Sole Ownership
         Single Family Homes - All Cash or Leveraged



1031 Exchange Rules


Once an Exchanger closes on the sale of an investment property he or she must identify a possible replacement for the relinquished property within 45 days as outlined by the 1031 exchange period. The 1031 exchange time limits and IRS Rules of section 1031 are outlined in Rev Proc 2002-22. The basic 1031 exchange rules involve the 1031 exchange time limit, 1031 exchange identification, like kind exchange rules, and how to designate property for a 1031 commercial exchange. When choosing a replacement property for the 1031 exchange the owner must follow one of the following three 1031 Exchange rules:

1. The “three-property” 1031 exchange rule: the owner may identify up to three properties, regardless of their value.

2. The “200 percent” 1031 exchange rule: the owner may identify any number of 1031 replacement properties as long as the combined fair market value (FMV) of those properties does not exceed 200% of the FMV of all sold properties.

3. The “95 percent” 1031 exchange rule: The owner may identify any number of 1031 exchange properties no matter the aggregate FMV, as long as 95% of the value of those identified 1031 exchange properties is acquired.

	In all cases of a 1031 exchange, the owner must close on the identified replacement property(s) within 180 days from the sale date of the original property.

1031 Exchange Requirements


To fully defer all capital gain taxes, a 1031 exchanger must meet four 1031 Exchange requirements:


1. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must reinvest a 100% of sale proceeds. If a 1031 exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property, the balance received is considered "cash boot," and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount.

2 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt. If a 1031 exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt, he or she is relieved of a debt obligation, and this is called a "mortgage boot." The IRS considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the 1031 exchanger; therefore, it is taxable, unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase.

3. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The investor must use a “qualified 1031 intermediary” (also known as a “1031 facilitator” or “1031 accommodator”) to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed. The “qualified 1031 intermediary” (QI) acts as the “middle-man” in the 1031 exchange, providing the paperwork, oversight, escrow services, and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a 1031 Exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. Even though a 1031 Exchange is a complicated process, a 1031 Exchange using a good QI can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale.

4. 1031 Exchange Requirement: The new investment must be in “like-kind” property. IRS 1031 Exchange rules require the 1031 exchange of "like-kind" relinquished property for other "like-kind" replacement property. This doesn’t mean, though, that 1031 exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property. Bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property. Any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a 1031 Exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business.

What is a qualified 1031 intermediary?


A qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a 1031 exchange. The taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary. Most intermediaries are affiliated with banks, trust companies, or title companies. Using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a 1031 exchange. Essentially, the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property. These are simple documents that the attorney fills out, along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary. Through these three documents, the intermediary is brought into the 1031 exchange and, subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below, the transaction can qualify as a 1031 exchange rather than a taxable sale.

The 1031 Exchange Process in 4 easy steps


There are several types of 1031 exchanges, the process is different for each type. These are the steps for the most common type of 1031 exchange, a delayed exchange.
	Delayed Exchange - Property is sold and replacement property is purchased within 180 days. Replacement property must be identified within 45 days. Because of the 180 day window this is the most popular type of 1031 exchange.

STEP 1 - PLAN THE TRANSACTION. Talk with your Qualified Intermediary to discuss your transaction. After listening to your investment objectives we'll determine the best way to structure your transaction. We'll estimate the amount of potential capital gains taxes you'll save.

STEP 2 - PURCHASE & SALE AGREEMENT. The exchange often begins with a standard purchase and sale agreement. The agreement should contain language which establishes the exchanger's intent to exchange and obtains the buyers consent to cooperate. Your Qualified Intermediary will convert this "sale" transaction into an exchange with the use of specialized documentation.

STEP 3 - RELINQUISHED PROPERTY. Once you have decided to perform an exchange contact Qualified Intermediary immediately. Also notify all parties to the transaction of your intent to exchange, including your real estate agent, closing agent, accountant and attorney. Your Qualified Intermediary will collect the information needed to prepare the exchange documents. The originals will be forwarded to the closing agent for execution at closing. Copes are sent to all parties for review. At closing the exchanger will transfer the relinquished property to Qualified Intermediary and Qualified Intermediary will simultaneously sell the property to the buyer. The proceeds are then paid the Qualified Intermediary and held for the acquisition of the replacement property.

STEP 4 - REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. After closing the relinquished property, the exchanger has 45 days to identify the replacement property and 180 days to complete the exchange. The exchanger notifies Qualified Intermediary once they have entered into an agreement to purchase the replacement property. Qualified Intermediary will deliver the documents needed to complete the exchange to the closing agent. At closing, the property is purchased by Qualified Intermediary and transferred to the exchanger. The exchange is now complete.

Can you send me a list of apartments in Austin? Unfortunately there is no such thing as a true updated list of available Austin apartment rentals.  There are 1000's of apartments, rental management and private owners in town, without an MLS type system. Which is why we exist - because it IS an overwhelming task to do it yourself.  Therefore  we have no correlated list available that we can send you. You can always check our website for an updated selection (but it only lists a small percentage of what available apartments in Austin we have) .  Anyone who says they have a list of apartments  actually has a limited database of the units - the ones that will work with them on a smaller commission when they "send" you to apartments on that list, without checking availability - MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE AVAILABILITY OF UNITS MEETING YOUR CRITERIA. The main reason a list wouldn't help you is that it doesn't show what is available!  Availability of units for a particular price, area, etc. literally change daily. Our job is to do the legwork for you, and find the best ones available using your criteria so you can pick from the top ones. Otherwise, you might as well use the yellow pages as a "list".

In order to give you the most choices, we work all open listings, not just ours.(we work with well over 95% of the complexes in town) In some cases, we can meet you at the property to make it easy on you. Or in some situations (like a long distance, sight unseen rental) , register you ahead of time, so we would not have to be there, but we have to arrange this before you look at the property. BACK TO TOPOur Mission“We are dedicated to delivering exemplary service while providing our customers with essential information and resources to make informed relocation decisions in choosing a quality apartment environment.”Our mission is to be your full-service, one-stop source for finding the best rental at tremendous savings and making your next move simple and hassle-free.

Texas gained a whopping 490,000 new residents in that time. Together, the Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas were responsible for more than 412,000 of those new Texans.With a 3 percent population increase, Austin-Round Rock was the fastest-growing metro area in the state, the seventh fastest in the nation. The area added 57,395 new residents — that's about 157 people per day. The area's population is currently estimated at over 2 million, but the Austin region could reach 3 million people in just four short years. This massive influx of Central Texans adds to the speculation that the I-35 corridor could mimic the collision of our neighbors in North Texas.Falling just behind Houston is Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, which added 144,704 residents. A total population of 7.1 million means Dallas-Fort Worth remains the most populous metro in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.SDowntown Austin apartment rents rise, vacancy up and a flood of units is on the wayExpect the depth and stability of the luxury downtown apartment market to be tested in the next few months.The latest apartment survey published by Austin Investors Interests LLC indicates vacancies are growing substantially in that particular market segment. New deliveries have pushed occupancy to 82 percent in the urban core, compared to 90 percent last quarter.In the past 12 months about 2,341 luxury units have delivered in a four-mile radius of downtown and more than double that are under construction in the same area."How will the impact of another 5,800 units affect this downtown area?" Average price per square foot of new build in the urban core is anywhere from $1.73 per square foot to $3.16 per square foot.Investors in older product are taking advantage of demand by creating more appealing, renovated units."Over a third of the market has or is upgrading to at least faux wood floors, two-inch blinds, brushed nickel hardware, new appliances, ceiling fans, granite counters, paint, hardware and lights. The expense seems to be paying off," the report states.The next several months will be very telling about developers' decisions to flood the market with expensive units. Average rent across Austin market is $1.31 per square foot, about 6 percent more than a year ago. The highest rents are in the Central Business District where the average across all product types is $2.52 per square foot, an increase of 2.2 percent from a year ago. The overall occupancy rate for apartment communities that are stabilized (usually open for more than a year) is 93.6 percent. Concessions, such as free rent for several weeks, are returning to the market, mostly among new apartment communities downtown.  About 2,615 new apartment units delivered across the market in 2Q 2015. About 12,080 units are scheduled to deliver in the next year.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Austin Texas Apartment Market Report4th Quarter Austin Apartment Trends    Effective Rent $1,115    Occupancy 91.7%    Annual Job Change 28,600 jobs    Annual Permits 9,484 units    Annual Demand 8,868 units    Annual Completions 12,115 units    Annual number of New Residents 57,395 4th Quarter Austin Performance HighlightsThe Austin metro has been a national leader for economic growth for more than two years. Broad-based economic gains combined with the metro’s already favorable demographics have fueled demand for housing, which has generated strong revenue growth for the apartment sector, strengthened fundamentals and led to elevated levels of apartment development. Occupancy has hovered around the 95% mark for over three years. With tight occupancy, apartment operators have pushed rents, but rent growth levels dipped a bit in 2014 in response to a growing amount of completions and notable construction pipeline. Effective rents increased 5.0% in 2015, 3.6% in 2014 – which was meaningfully lower than the 4.8% hike in 2013. Driving the recent slowdown was softness in the top-end of the market. For example, Class A product saw a mere 1.9% rent increase during 2014, compared to a 4.8% gain recorded in Class B assets during the same time. At this point in the cycle, a continued point of strength remains in the middle market. However, the question remains whether the overall market can hold up against growing supply volumes.What changed this quarter? Quarterly apartment demand in Austin showed seasonal weakness during 2014’s 4th quarter, as 802 units were absorbed. Meanwhile, new supply easily outpaced net demand, which led to a 1.1-point decline in the overall occupancy rate. In response, operators cut effective rents 0.4% quarter-over-quarter, the first quarterly decline since 4th quarter 2012.Source: http://www.realpage.com/mpf-research/reports/austin/ALN METRO SUMMARYTX - Austin                                OVERALL MARKET                                                             OCCUPANCY               % CHANGE             EFFECTIVE RENT                %CHG                                                                         Mar 13      Mar 14                                          Mar-13    Mar-14    94.3%      91.8%           -2.7%                      $953     $1,031                   8.2%      Sept 13    Sept 14                                         Sept 13  Sept 14                  94.4%     93.5%             -0.9%                   $1,009     $1,084                 7.4%    Apr 15   Apr 16                              Apr 15   Apr 1690.7%      91.7%               1.1%                    $1,104     $1,173                 6.2%       BACK TO TOPHistorical Data on Renting in Central Texas * Note: Current rents recently surpassed the previous highest rents in Austin (in June 2000)Quoted Rents are for 2-bedroom, 2-bath units.

For Austin apartment renters, finally some relief on prices For the past few years, apartment dwellers in the Austin area have been hoping for some rent relief.It seems to have arrived at last.Slower job growth in Central Texas (read: lower demand), coupled with thousands of new apartments coming to market (read: increased supply), have caused apartment rents to plateau, according to experts and new reports.In addition, the occupancy rate has slipped, dipping to 93.8 percent in December from 94.5 percent the prior December, according to Capitol Market Research, an Austin consulting firm that tracks the Central Texas apartment market.“You can see renters gaining more leeway since some new apartment buildings in Austin are offering concessions for the first time (in years), things like a month of free rent or discounted security deposits,” said Crystal Chen, a data analyst with apartment rental website Zumper.Last year ended with rents in the Austin market overall averaging $1,224 a month, up 2.8 percent from December 2015. From December 2014 to December 2015, however, the increase had been much higher, with rents soaring 7.5 percent, per Capitol Market Research.________________________________________“Throughout the market, particularly in areas with a lot of new deliveries, we’re beginning to see concessions,” said Charles Heimsath, president of Capitol Market Research. “Because of the concessions, rental rates have stabilized, which is good news for tenants.”On a per square foot basis, rents averaged $1.39 a foot in December, the same as in June 2016, “so the rate of increase in rents has stopped,” Heimsath said.Last year, developers brought 10,780 apartment units to market, the highest amount since 1991, when Heimsath started tracking the numbers. He said 8,770 units were leased, a net number and the second-highest level after 2015. However, the 2,100 additional units that came online last year over 2015 pushed down the occupancy rate to its current level of just under 94 percent, he said.“Rents have stabilized, and I expect that rents will remain stable through 2017,” Heimsath said. “And because we’re growing jobs at a slower rate, it’s reasonable to assume that our occupancy is likely to drop a little bit more, because we will continue to deliver new units.”Rents softening Since Zumper started tracking rents in 100 U.S. cities last July, it said Austin has dropped from the 24th most expensive rental market to the 28th most expensive rental market currently.In a separate report, AppFolio, a property management software company, ranked Austin among the five most affordable U.S. cities in which to rent, based on the percentage of monthly income spent on housing.In Austin, renters on average spend 23 percent of their monthly income on housing, the survey found.New York and Miami, whose residents pay more than half of their monthly income on housing, are the most rent burdened, AppFolio said.AppFolio is forecasting rent costs will increase about 2 percent in the Austin metro for 2017, said Nat Kunes, vice president of product management at AppFolio. “That’s still healthy growth,” Kunes said. “It’s not like rents are dropping. They just aren’t growing as fast as they have been the last few years.”Greg Willett, chief economist for RealPage, a rental housing technology and analytics firm based in Richardson, said Austin’s apartment market “lost considerable momentum” during the last half of 2016 as the area’s job growth cooled.Though rents softened in Austin over the past year as supply caught up to demand, construction will slow after this year, said David Ott Jr., development partner with The Hanover Company. The Houston-based developer recently opened the first units at Hanover Lantana Hills, a 300-unit complex in Southwest Austin that is due to be completed this spring.“After another big year of supply expected in 2017 — 7,000-plus units — apartment deliveries will taper off due to a lack of available re-development properties, construction costs at all-time highs, and construction loans becoming difficult to obtain,” Ott said.‘Suburban uprising’ After seeing more than 5,000 apartment units added in downtown Austin since 2012, apartment construction has slowed in the central business district and developers are betting on the suburbs, said CoStarGroup, a commercial real estate information company based in Washington, D.C. In Austin’s suburbs, 10,506 apartment units are under construction compared with 620 units underway downtown, CoStar said.“The necessary income required for an apartment in downtown Austin is around $160,000, yet the median income for the market hovers around $40,000 – a large disparity, even with roommates,” CoStar said.“Only so many people have the income to afford (downtown rents),” said Sam Tenenbaum, a market economist with CoStar.Meanwhile, “the demand for new housing is strong in the suburbs, where developers aim for renters much closer to the market’s median income,” CoStar said. “Occupancy rates are already as high as 95.7 percent in San Marcos, and 93.8 percent in North and Northwest Austin.”Most of the job growth is outside of downtown, Tenenbaum said, and mixed-use projects like the Domain in North Austin have brought the urban lifestyle to suburbia.At the Mueller neighborhood in Northeast Austin, job growth is a catalyst for a surge of new development at the mixed-use project.“Mueller is extremely busy these days with office, retail and residential activity, including three (apartment) communities all under construction… totaling nearly 760 units,” said Greg Weaver, executive vice president of Catellus Development Corp., the master developer of Mueller. “The demand for multifamily is exceptionally strong.”Those three projects — Overture, Aldrich 51 and a new AMLI complex— will bring Mueller’s apartment count to 1,981 units. Mueller is expected to have about 3,600 apartment units once completed.Weaver said that “the significant job growth at Mueller certainly contributes to the strength of the residential market.“We estimate more than 4,800 people already work at Mueller and the upcoming Texas Mutual Insurance headquarters will bring another 700 employees,” Weaver said.Catching a rent break For many renters, a shot at lower rents — or concessions such as a first month of rent for free — comes as welcome news.Allison Golden will be moving to Austin soon from Dallas with her boyfriend, Ace Tucker, 24. Golden said she feels fortunate to have found a unit at Bell South Lamar, where they will get one month of free rent.She said their total savings will be $1,640 — $1,393 for the first month’s free rent, plus waived fees.“I thought we would have to compromise on location if we wanted to stay within our budget but this deal made it easy for us to be in a prime location,” said Golden, who works in public relations.Golden said she and Tucker wanted an apartment that was walking distance to shops and restaurants, and that was pet-friendly for Tucker’s chocolate Labrador, Ace. “I love the fact they have a very large dog park,” she said.Just south of downtown, Alexandra Morgan, 27, and her boyfriend, Sharam Khosravipou, 28, recently moved into a second-floor unit in the new Water Marq complex on Riverside Drive, overlooking Lady Bird Lake. They got two months’ free rent, and will be paying just over $1,900 a month for a unit with 875 square feet.“Moving from Chicago a little over a year ago I thought I had lived in apartments with luxury amenities, but then I saw the Water Marq,” said Morgan, an associate at Dimensional Fund Advisors in Austin. “The amenities were unlike any I have seen before.” They include a two-story gym with rowing machines, a yoga studio, a spin class room and an on-site fitness instructor. A big plus is an indoor dog-washing station, which will come in handy for Kevin, their cocker spaniel.“We have been at the Water Marq for a little less than a month but we already feel at home,” Morgan said.Austin-area average monthly apartment rents Dec. 2016 — Dec. 2015One-bedroom $1,070 — $1,037Two-bedroom $1,354 — $1,325Source: Capitol Market ResearchBack to topWebsite Designed at Homestead Make a Website and List Your Business

Winners revealed: A night of celebration at the Marketing New Thinking Awards

Always #LikeAGirl, the powerful campaign that captured the female empowerment zeitgeist, has swept the board at the inaugural Marketing New Thinking Awards in association with Sky Media, scooping the Grand Prix and three category gongs.

The Procter & Gamble feminine hygiene brand triumphed in the Cultural Shift, Social Branding and Brand Evolution categories, making the work a worthy Grand Prix winner.
Original thinking is vital for a prosperous economy
The Awards, which were announced at a glittering ceremony at Somerset House this evening (12 October), celebrated companies, agencies and individuals who are making brands fit for the future.
The other big brand winner of the night was Airbnb, named Innovative Brand of the Year by Marketing’s editorial team.
Since its launch in 2008 in the US, the accommodation site has expanded to 190 countries and 34,000 cities, building its brand to live through creative marketing campaigns.
Adam & Eve/DDB, the most shortlisted agency in the Awards, was named New Thinking Agency of the Year.
The agency’s entries across Unilever brands Flora and Marmite, Save the Children and its much-awarded Harvey Nichols and John Lewis work demonstrated vision and originality.



Important stories
Winners across the 12 categories, designed to reflect today’s important stories in marketing, include Sainsbury’s, John Lewis, Santander, Ikea and Beats by Dre. Rachel Barnes, Marketing’s editor, said: "The winners represent the brands and agencies that truly understand the complex marketing landscape and embrace the constant evolution demanded of them in an age of rapid change.
Entries for these awards exceeded targets and the standard of the work that we and the judges analysed left us in no doubt that the influence, vibrancy and sheer creativity of marketing in the UK is second to none."
Rachel Bristow, Sky Media’s director of partnerships, said: "Original thinking is vital for a prosperous economy.
At Sky we always admire those companies which successfully intertwine technology, insight, consumer behaviour, engineering and commercial flair; and the individuals within them who bring those disparate disciplines and people together to achieve great outcomes.
"We’re thrilled to be supporting the Marketing New Thinking Awards in its inaugural year. These awards are about giving credit where it’s due.
Applying creativity, innovation and new thinking to brands can be a tough challenge, and these awards seek to recognise those who have done so with outstanding results," she added.

Jackson, the City with Soul, is the largest city in Mississippi. Burned down three times during the Civil War, Jackson has also served as the setting of major events during the Civil Rights Movement, many of which are commemorated with Mississippi Freedom Trail Markers throughout the city. Learning about an array of subjects is easy in Jackson, which is home to a number of museums including the Old Capitol Museum, Mississippi Children’s Museum, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, and the Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center.

The music, arts, culinary, and culture scenes are all booming in Jackson. Residents can listen to live music at F. Jones Corner or One Block East, appreciate art at any of the many downtown galleries or the Mississippi Museum of Art, experience fine dining at restaurants such as Manship Wood Fired Kitchen and Bully’s Restaurant, and even witness the International Ballet Competition at Thalia Mara Hall. Jackson also contains one of the largest and best equipped planetariums in the South, the Russell C. Davis Planetarium. 

Accessible to Interstates 20, 55, and 220 as well as Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport, Jackson is just a three-hour drive from both New Orleans and Memphis.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
