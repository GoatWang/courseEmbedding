Ce livre, est le premier d'une série de 7 livres démystifiant 144 Révélations Métaphysiques.  Tout se joue en 7 ans! 2015 est effectivement une date historique à se rappeler, puisqu'elle constitue un pont entre deux mondes.  Les choix actuels sont d'une extrême importance, ils déterminent l'envolée ou la stagnation.   Tout compte; les pensées, actions et attitudes de vie.  Chaque seconde est comptée. Les 18 premières Révélations contenues dans ce premier livre, dévoilent pas à pas les prises de conscience pour atteindre un niveau de Conscience Supérieure et ainsi transmuter toute lourdeur énergétqiue qui empêcherait l'élévation spirituelle.  Ces Révélations sont un regard philosophique qui me suivent depuis plusieurs vies, en fait, depuis le saut initial.  Que cette lecture soit une Source d'Inspiration pour tous. Bonne...

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
