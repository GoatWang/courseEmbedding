They also give little perks like gym membership reimbursement, hold self improvement sessions. The pay is average for most roles, and if you are looking at an average range of pay, its the lower end of the average. They have a lot of company activities, like happy hours, yoga & zumba during lunch etc. Each year they hold one of the best holiday parties I've ever attended. Work life balance is good and most managers are quite accommodating when it comes to sick children / school events etc.ConsCareer growth is very limited. If you are the kind of person who will just do his job and not try to advance or change anything this is a good place to be. Its very difficult to move within the organization, internal promotion is hardly encouraged and even when you try it takes forever. An internal employee is the last person they want to hire. Its reverse at most places. And pay raises are hard to come by if you are a low / mid level employee. The higher ups are paid well. So you will see a lot of turnover in the lower ranks, but the higher ups have been there forever. They dont allow remote working. Most managers are micro managers. Things happen very slowly here, everything requires approval of the CEO, most manager have little to no power to effect change.Advice to ManagementPromote from within. They are more likely to hit the ground running unlike an external hire who will take atleast a couple of months to figure everything out.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) ProFunds Response seconds agoEdit • Delete ProFunds 2014-11-12 04:19 PST Dec 25, 2014 Helpful (7)"Not a company that I would recommend anyone work for."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Portfolio Management in Bethesda, MDFormer Employee - Portfolio Management in Bethesda, MDDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at ProFunds full-time (More than 3 years)ProsStable company given high level of assets under management.ConsLow salaries, low bonuses and high turnover.

Lousy pay unless you are part of top management. Huge disparity in pay between top & lower levels of management. Management doesnt care about its employees. Employees have no input into anything. This company is a one man show and therefore nothing ever gets done. Resistant to change.

The company is small in terms of staff (about 150 when I was there) but huge in assets and scope. They work pretty hard for happy employees- all the free lunches and parties and the holiday galas at the Smithsonian with entertainment and gourmet food- it was a great job. Also, I never worked with such nice and welcoming people who also are some of the smartest people in the industry- it was amazing, definitely the best boss of my life was there. I thought my salary was pretty good and the bonus structure was confusing, but generous.ConsThe entire company is run by the CEO- every single decision above a few thousand dollars goes through him- meaning it can be tricky some days to get done what you need to get done, if he's decided to take an interest in it- you'll spend all your time trying to convince him you know what you're doing, rather than DOING it. Then again, the everyone internally deals with it, so everyone understands that's what happened. Vendors get frustrated as hell, so that's never fun to deal with, but its a big enough company most of them are willing to deal with it to a point. All in all, one of the best jobs I ever had and I miss it all the time.Advice to ManagementYou can't have people step up as leaders if they aren't given a chance to do so. One day the CEO will leave and they will be totally unprepared for how to deal with it, so expanding decision making capabilities will avoid a major problem if an emergency were to happen. It also gets frustrating for an employee who knows they probably won't ever significantly advance within the company because of that which leads to slightly higher turnover than they really should have of their more experienced employees.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) ProFunds Response seconds agoEdit • Delete ProFunds 2014-08-07 17:39 PDT Mar 11, 2013 Helpful (4)"PM"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookProsLearn a lot of derivativesConsOwners could treat employees betterShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) ProFunds Response seconds agoEdit • Delete ProFunds 2013-03-11 19:25 PDT May 10, 2016"PLEASE NOTE THIS IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED TO PRO FUNDS MORTGAGES BURLINGTON ONTARIO"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeProsHello,Please be advised that Pro Funds Group located in Columbus Ohio, is in no way affiliated with Pro Funds Mortgages located in Burlington, Ontario Canada.ConsThere has been confusion surrounding this Glass Door Review as it is based on a Canadian website.

Upper management has no clue how to work with employees and their needs. Lack of communication about expectations. Very little trust of employees and their capabilities. Total lack of direction. Completely rudderless at times. I could go on but you get my drift.Advice to ManagementThe rest of the management team needs to grow a spine and stand up to the owners. Relax with the total control of all aspects of the company and let people do their job that they were hired for.

Business Continuity Plan
ProFunds has a flexible Business Continuity Plan ("BCP") to respond to events that significantly disrupt business. ProFunds' BCP is designed to enable quick recovery and resumption of business operations after a significant business disruption ("SBD") by safeguarding employees and property, making financial and operational assessments, and protecting books and records so ProFunds can continue to transact business.
 
ProFunds' BCP addresses the following areas: data back-up and recovery; all mission-critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communication methods with business constituents, employees, and regulators; alternative physical location for critical employees; service providers; and regulatory reporting. Back-up records are maintained electronically, and certain documentation is secured off site. While every emergency situation poses unique problems, it is ProFunds' and its technology service providers' objectives to restore all services as soon as possible.
SBDs vary in scope and severity. They may disrupt operations solely at ProFunds, or they may affect a larger area. Should an SBD occur applying solely to ProFunds' primary place of business, the firm will transfer operations to an off-site location and generally resume business the same day.

SEC 30-Day Yield is a standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that facilitates fairer comparisons of funds. The figure reflects dividends and interest earned by the securities held by the fund during the most recent 30-day period, net the fund's expenses.







Unsubsidized SEC 30-Day Yield shows what the SEC 30-Day Yield would have been without the contractual fee waiver.
		






Duration is a measurement of how long, in years, it takes for the price of a bond to be repaid by its internal cash flows. Modified duration accounts for changing interest rates. It measures the sensitivity of the value of a bond (or bond portfolio) to a change in interest rates. Higher duration means greater sensitivity.







		The weighted average maturity (WAM) of a portfolio is the average time, in years, it takes for the bonds in a bond fund or portfolio to mature. WAM is calculated by weighting each bond's time to maturity by the size of the holding. Portfolios with longer WAMs are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
	    







Yield to maturity (YTM) is the annual rate of return paid on a bond if it is held until the maturity date. Weighted average yield to maturity represents an average of the YTM of each of the bonds held in a bond fund or portfolio, weighted by the relative size of each bond in the portfolio.
	    







		A coupon is the interest rate paid out on a bond on an annual basis. The weighted average coupon of a bond fund is arrived at by weighting the coupon of each bond by its relative size in the portfolio.
	    







Weighted average price (WAP)  is computed for most bond funds by weighting the price of each bond by its relative size in the portfolio. This statistic is expressed as a percentage of par (face) value. The price shown here is "clean," meaning it does not reflect accrued interest. 
	    







Monthly volatility refers to annualized standard deviation, a statistical measure that captures the variation of returns from their mean and that is often used to quantify the risk of a fund or index over a specific time period. The higher the volatility, the more the returns fluctuate over time.
	    







Absolute return strategies seek to provide positive returns in a wide variety of market conditions. These strategies employ investment techniques that go beyond conventional long-only investing, including leverage, short selling, futures, options, etc.
			







Arbitrage refers to the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the price of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms. For example, convertible arbitrage looks for price differences among linked securities, like stocks and convertible bonds of the same company. Merger arbitrage involves investing in securities of companies that are the subject of some form of corporate transaction, including acquisition or merger proposals and leveraged buyouts.
			







Commodity refers to a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Examples include oil, grain and livestock.
			







Correlation is a statistical measure of how two variables relate to each other. Two different investments with a correlation of 1.0 will move in exact lockstep, investments with a correlation of zero will not move at all in relation to each other, while investments with a correlation of -1.0 will move in opposite directions. The higher the correlation, the lower the diversifying effect.
			







Currency refers to a generally accepted medium of exchange, such as the dollar, the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, etc.
			







Market neutral is a strategy that involves attempting to remove all directional market risk by being equally long and short.
			







Futures refers to a financial contract obligating the buyer to purchase an asset (or the seller to sell an asset), such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
			







Global macro strategies aim to profit from changes in global economies that are typically brought about by shifts in government policy, which impact interest rates and in turn affect currency, bond and stock markets.
			







Hedge funds invest in a diverse range of markets and securities, using a wide variety of techniques and strategies, all intended to reduce risk while focusing on absolute rather than relative returns.
			







Leverage refers to using borrowed funds to make an investment. Investors use leverage when they believe the return of an investment will exceed the cost of borrowed funds. Leverage can increase the potential for higher returns, but can also increase the risk of loss.
			







Long/short strategies involve using a combination of long and short positions in securities with the objective of reducing market risk and enhancing return. 
			







Managed futures involves taking long and short positions in futures and options in the global commodity, interest rate, equity, and currency markets.
			







Precious metals refer to gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
			







Private equity consists of equity securities in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange.
			







Real estate refers to land plus anything permanently fixed to it, including buildings, sheds and other items attached to the structure.
			







Short selling or "shorting" involves selling an asset before it's bought. Typically, an investor borrows shares, immediately sells them, and later buys them back to return to the lender.
			







Volatility is the relative rate at which the price of a security (or benchmark) moves up and down. Volatility is also an asset class that can be traded in the futures markets. Tradable volatility is based on implied volatility, which is a measure of what the market expects the volatility of a security's price to be in the future.
			







Geared investing refers to leveraged or inverse investing. 
                  • Leveraged investments provide magnified exposure to an asset or benchmark. 
                  • Inverse investments provide inverse exposure to an asset or benchmark.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. The Morningstar Rating™ is provided for those ETFs with at least a 3-year history. Ratings are based on the ETF's Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure which accounts for variation in monthly performance. The fund's performance and rating are calculated based on net asset value (NAV), not market price. An ETF's risk-adjusted return includes a brokerage commission estimate. This estimate is intended to reflect what an average investor would pay when buying or selling an ETF. This estimate is subject to change, and the actual commission an investor pays may be higher or lower. Morningstar compares each ETF's risk-adjusted return to the open-end mutual fund rating breakpoints for that category. The top 10% of ETFs in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The overall rating for an ETF is based on a weighted average of the time-period ratings (e.g., the ETF's 3-year rating). The determination of an ETF's rating does not affect the retail open-end mutual fund data published by Morningstar. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.







Duration to Worst (expressed in years) is the approximate amount by which a bond's price changes given a 1% change in its yield, calculated using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first.
			







SEC 30-Day Yield is a standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows investors to more fairly compare funds.








30-Day SEC Yield is designed to provide a standardized comparison of funds. The figure is calculated by dividing the net investment income (less expenses) by the current maximum offering price. 








30-Day SEC Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income (less expenses) by the current maximum offering price, and is designed to provide a standardized comparison of funds.
			







SEC 30-Day Yield (unsubsidized) is what the SEC 30-day yield would have been without the contractual fee waiver.
			







Current yield is equal to a bond's annual interest payment divided by its current market price. The current yield only refers to the yield of the bond at the current moment, not the total return over the life of the bond.
			







Dividend yield shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price. In the absence of any capital gains, the dividend yield is the return on investment for a stock.
			







Effective duration is a measure of a fund's sensitivity to interest rate changes, reflecting the likely change in bond prices given a small change in yields. Higher duration generally means greater sensitivity. Effective duration for this fund is calculated including both the long bond positions and the short Treasury futures positions.

			







Distribution Yield represents the annualized yield based on the last income distribution.
			







12-Month Yield represents the annualized yield based on the last twelve months of income distributions.
			







Trailing price to earnings ratio measures market value of a fund or index relative to the collective earnings of its component stocks for the most recent 12-month period.
			







Price to book ratio measures market value of a fund or index relative to the collective book values of its component stocks.
			







Weighted average market cap is the average market value of a fund or index, weighted for the market capitalization (price times shares outstanding) of each component. In such a weighting scheme, larger market cap companies carry greater weight than smaller market cap companies.
			







				Sometimes distributions are re-characterized for tax purposes after they've been declared. Here, a previous dividend has been re-characterized as a Return of Capital ("ROC"). An ROC is a distribution to investors that returns some or all of their capital investment, thus reducing the value of their investment. In an efficient market, the investment's price will fall by an amount approximately equal to the ROC. In general, investors are not taxed on an ROC unless it begins to exceed their original investment value.
			







				This is the dollar amount of your initial investment in the fund.
			







				This is the percentage change in the index or benchmark since your initial investment. Enter a positive or negative number.
			







				This is the dollar value that your account should be after you rebalance.
			







				This is the dollar amount you have invested in your fund.
			







			Credit default swap (CDS) spread reflects the annualized amount (espressed in basis points) that a CDS protection buyer will pay to a protection seller. Higher CDS spreads indicate that the CDS market views the entity as having a higher risk of loss. The weighted average CDS spread in a portfolio is the sum of CDS spreads of each contract in the portfolio multiplied by their relative weights.







Spread duration is a measure of a fund's approximate mark-to-market price sensitivity to small changes in CDS spreads. Higher spread duration reflects greater sensitivity.







			Shareholder Supplemental Tax Information







The S&P 500 is a measure of large-cap U.S. stock market performance. It is a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted index of 500 U.S. operating companies and real estate investment trusts selected through a process that factors in criteria such as liquidity, price, market capitalization and financial viability.







Infrastructure refers to companies that actually own and operate the transportation, communications, energy and water assets that provide essential services to our society.
