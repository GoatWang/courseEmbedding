Operator
Good morning. My name is Dana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KCG Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Andrew Smith, you may begin your conference.
Andrew Smith
Thank you, Dana. Good morning and welcome. Today’s call may including forward-looking statements, which represents Virtu’s current belief regarding future events and are therefore subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties, which may be outside the Company's control, and our actual result and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements.
It is important to note that any forward-looking statements made on this call are based on information presently available to the company and we do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as new information becomes available. We refer you to disclaimers in our press releases and encourage you to review the description of risk factors contained in our final S1 Registration Statement and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition to GAAP results, we may refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted net trading income, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We believe these non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our operations and core business performance. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP terms included in the earnings materials with an explanation of why we deem this information be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures. When used on this call, adjusted net trading income refers to our trading income net of all interest and dividend income and expenses, and all brokerage clearing and exchange fees and/or rebates.
Speaking and answering your questions today are Mr. Douglas Cifu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Joseph Molluso, our Chief Financial Officer. They will begin with some prepared remarks and then turn the time over to the operator to take some of your questions.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Doug.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you Andrew and thank you all for joining us today on such short notice. I am extremely pleased and humbled to announce today that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire KCG Holdings. KCG is a prominent and unique franchise that has served in these – of an impressive array of customers for decades. This is a transformative acquisition for Virtu and represents a natural evolution for our company. Our scale, efficiency and advanced order routing capabilities will now be married with KCG’s extraordinary client franchise and KCG's hundreds of talented employees and will allow Virtu to accelerate its strategic priorities.
Importantly, this transaction takes place that what we believe is an opportune time to be investing in the market making and agency businesses given historically low points in global realized volatility, which are naturally cyclical. Finally, we will be able to achieve meaningful cost and capital synergies that will create significant value for Virtu’s shareholders.
I will go through some selective slides in the presentation that we have distributed this morning and discuss the strategic rationale and why this transaction is a unique opportunity that will expand, strengthen and diversify the combined platform and set us up for future growth. Then I will turn the call over to Joe to discuss select key terms and review detail around significant expense and capital synergies in this transaction.

While on a standalone basis Virtu’s role as the leading liquidity provider across asset classes in 36 countries continues to grow, simply put this transaction will allow us to access for the first time customer order flow in our Americas Equities business and accelerate our growth in our agency execution segment. As outlined in the Slide 4, we will leverage Virtu’s scale, geographic reach and micro market structure expertise to interact with order flow that KCG receives from its customer franchise.
We believe we can enhance the customer experience and improve profitability by trading more efficiently and using Virtu’s advanced order routing capabilities. Our experience outside the United States, where we interact with retail and institutional order flow in a segmented manner is that our execution quality and profitability while interacting with this type of flow is significantly enhanced and we are very excited about the opportunities presented.
As you know offering Virtu’s superior routing capabilities and post-trade analytics to select buy side clients has been a strategic priority and we have received tremendous feedback. KCG has built a marquee franchise in global execution services with connectivity to hundreds of buy side and sell side financial institution in an impressive suite of algorithmic products. These established relationships will provide immediate and significant growth opportunities as we marry Virtu’s competencies with KCG’s preeminent franchise.
Further, we believe the breath of the combined companies geographic and asset class footprint will strengthen our position as the leading partner for buy side and sell side institutions for infrastructure and agency execution services. We will also generate significant value creation in this transaction. We anticipate approximately $208 million of fully phased-in pretax net synergies in a transaction that is over 25% accretive to Virtu’s EPS on a run rate basis. Joe will provide details on these figures including the transaction details in Slide 5.
However, I do want to note that this transaction is financed partially with a $750 million equity investment from a mix of old and new shareholders including Temasek as well as our new partners at North Island led by Glenn Hutchins and Bob Greifeld, who are supported by PSP Investments, one of Canada's largest pension funds, and GIC, a sovereign wealth fund of Singapore. The debt component is supported by a commitment from our partners at J.P. Morgan to provide up to $1.65 billion in debt financing for the transaction.
The participation of the sophisticated global investors in our due diligence and structuring of this transaction is humbling and a tremendous vote of confidence in Virtu. Following the close of the transaction, I will serve as CEO of the combined company and Joe will remain the CFO. We are very excited and look forward to working with the talented world-class employees of KCG, who share our values and a culture of innovation and we are committed to realizing the full benefits of this transaction.
Additionally, two members of the Board of Directors will be added to our current board for a combined board of ten. I'm thrilled to announce that Bob Greifeld and Glenn Hutchins will both join us as partners and board members. Both have decades of experience in the financial services area and were pioneers in the first stage of electronification of the U.S. equity markets. They share our vision that as markets become more competitive and expensive to access only integrated financial services firms with true global scale will be capable of offering a superior two-sided price to end users and be consistently profitable.
Turning to Slide 6, I wanted to highlight how the strategic objectives we have identified to create long-term shareholder value for Virtu are accelerated in this transaction. We have said since our founding that our mission is to be the best fit and offer in all of the over 235 markets in which we participate in 36 countries globally. This transaction will allow us to move upstream and interact with order flow that prior to this transaction Virtu was not able to interact with in the United States and offer the enhanced value to these customers.

As I noted above, for us this is an extraordinary opportunity. Virtu has built a thriving business in U.S. equities based on market making without any customer flow. Now as we do in other parts of the world, we will be able to provide Virtu’s broad liquidity to wholesale order flow that tends to be non-correlated. So this in no way represents a new business for us, it is simply market making upstream by interacting with segmented retail and institutional and order flow. As a firm, we are very excited about these prospects.
Turning to Slide 7, I want to point out that this combination we believe will enhance the market making and agency business of Virtu and KCG in a way that neither of us could achieve on our own. KCG and Virtu each have unique strengths that can be levered to benefit the wholesale, principle and agency offerings. Before turning this over to Joe and for Q&A, I want to thank the many team members at KCG and Virtu as well as our respective advisors, who helped bring us to this point. In particular, I’ve got to know very well and respect KCG’s talented Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Coleman throughout this process and my personal thanks to Daniel for shepherding this process through. Joe?
Joseph Molluso
Thank you, Doug. I will pick up the slide deck on Slide 8, which shows the enhanced diversification to our revenue stream this transaction will bring. Based on 2016 numbers, this transaction will increase Virtu’s non-market making net revenues from 2% of the total to nearly 20%, an important and strategic diversification. Slide 9 reviews the expense synergies. There will be significant value creation to Virtu’s shareholders derived from achievable expense synergies. Through identifying redundant operations and consolidating businesses, trading debts, office facilities and other identified savings, we believe we will achieve run rate net expense synergies of $208 million over the first 24 months post closing.
In addition, we believe these efficiencies, which we have identified will concurrently results in the reduction of capital usage for the combined company by $440 million, which will be used to rapidly pay down debt and return the combined company to its current capital structure on a pro forma basis. Slide 10 is an attempt to demonstrate the powerful impact the transaction will have on our after-tax earnings. What we have done here is attempt to provide you with the pieces needed to understand how accretive this transaction is to Virtu.
When you look at a fully phased-in in this case year two of the transaction in this case 2019, you see that after-tax synergies, net of revenue dissynergies are $129 million. After applying the proceeds from debt reduction and other cash flows to pay down debt to current combined company levels, we’re assuming incremental $5 million in interest expense after-tax. You can then model across a variety of scenarios for KCG’s standalone contribution and therefore we expect over 25% earnings accretion across a range of scenarios.
Finally, I wanted to note on Slide 11 a significant unmodeled upside potential not included in any of the synergy estimates we have shared with you this morning. As you know with significant volumes, we’re able to achieve higher fee tiers at the venues on which we trade. We can estimate this figure today at $10 million to $15 million. Given the scale of the combined operation, we will be able to internalize more order flow which will allow greater profitability, reduce transaction costs and better performance for the end customer.
We believe there will be network effects and enhanced trading opportunities from combining both firms intellectual property. Virtu experiences a similar phenomenon when it merged with Madison Tyler in 2011. The combined business will benefit from KCG and Virtu's work in building out low latency networks and will benefit from increased order execution efficiency as a result of this.

We believe these elements of conservatism allow us to be very confident that this transaction will be significantly accretive and create value for Virtu’s shareholders. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows from operations. We mention that we will incur an incremental $600 million of new borrowings at the outset on a pro forma basis. At the time of the close, we expect the combined company to have total leverage of 5.1 times trailing 12 months combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA.
Including the achievable synergies, this leverage ratio would be 3.3 times less than a turn of EBITDA more than we have today. We intend to delever using significant pro-forma cash flow as well as the aforementioned $440 million in capital usage to pay down debt. We expect to delever to a ratio similar to our current level of debt within 12 to 18 months after the close of this transaction.
Finally, we've included a synopsis of preliminary Q1 numbers for Virtu. We will announce Q1 earnings on May 4th and have a full press release. The same environment that is impacted KCG’s Q1 earnings mainly historic lows and intra-day volatility and realized volatility has also impacted Virtu’s results. For the quarter, we expect to report adjusted net trading income of $79.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $47.6 million. Getting back to the transaction, we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2017 upon receipt of regulatory clearances and approval of stockholder of ours. Once this transaction closes, we will begin implementing the detailed integration plan to bring these two great companies together. Both the KCG and Virtu teams are confident in our ability to consummate successful transaction.
With that I will turn the call over to the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Warren Gardiner [Evercore ISI].
Douglas Cifu
Good morning, Warren.
Warren Gardiner
Can you may be just dig into the $42 million of revenue dissynergies a bit more like kind of where that comes from and what are some of the assumptions behind that number?
Douglas Cifu
Sure, I think it's really twofold and Joe can help you with all the details, but it's – we assume that there's going to be some books of business that are capital inefficient if you will that we will in a reduced positions and then get out of and so there's some revenue loss there, but significant capital pick ups. And as well we assume that there'll be some, in the transition that there'll be some revenue loss from customers that trade away for a time period, but would come back.
So I would argue – I would think that those numbers are conservative, but we wanted to make sure that they were included in the model from the get go. We think we can ultimately outperform that, but we wanted to be conservative with our revenue dissynergies. Joe?
Joseph Molluso
Yeah, that's right. I mean we are trying to be quite conservative as Doug said as we look at businesses where capital does not – the capital does not supported by the profitability and obviously we dug into all this in due diligence. We want to be – part of the good thing about being in this business today is that we feel we can migrate a lot of the revenues and obtain the capital efficiencies, but we're trying to be very conservative around that. So we've made some very, very detailed bottoms up assumptions and across a variety of desks and that – generate that number, Warren.
Warren Gardiner
Okay, thank you. And then I guess obviously some real benefit from moving upstream on the retail front, I mean any sense how should we maybe thinking about I guess sort of the accretion of the capture rate if you will on Americas Equities and then also maybe some color on – in Europe I know there’s sort of an effort on KCG’s front there as well with respect to retail just over there.

Douglas Cifu
Yeah, it’s a great question. And as I tried to note in my prepared remarks, this is not like a new business for us really what happened globally is you have segmentation of order flow and it’s done by different mechanisms and different regulatory regimes. In the United States, you have this well oiled machine if you will some people call payment order flow or wholesale market making whatever is and in Europe and in Asia it’s done differently. So we participate in segmented markets globally in Europe and in Asia in particular. And in those markets while we don't disclose individual capture rates for an all call market as opposed to a segmented market we can tell you just episodically if you will and obviously we track this by venue and by strategy that there is a meaningful difference as to how our strategies perform not surprisingly when they're not in an all to all market but they're in a segmented market.
And so translating that to the United States and to the KCG business, we’re obviously very optimistic that having access to that order flow with our partners and new friends at KCG that we can significantly augment the experience that the customer has and also maximize our profitability as we interact with that. I would also point out that the thing that we have done very well as a firm is really hone our entry and exit of positions. When you don't have the benefit if you will of customer and institutional order flow when you're fighting in the all to all market, you've got to be very acute and very good around technology, understanding market structure and you have to have a low cost environment. That's really been the Virtu’s story, right.
We don't have a competitive advantage in terms of having institutional and retail order flow on a large scale basis and so we've spent the 10 years since we started this firm really doing that. That's the DNA of this firm, micro market structure scale efficiency. KCG comes at this from a different point of view right, which is they've got this great customer franchises, institutional and retail franchise that they've had for two decades and they do a fantastic job at it. In due diligence and just around the market, they're kind of the platinum standard if you will customer service.
And so they're providing a service on the market making side. We're providing a service if you will on the market making side and they're coming from the north, we're coming from the south and we're sort of meeting at the equator right because at the end of the day you've seen this conversion of technology and efficiency in the marketplace. And we think by combining the two, we're going to get one plus one equals three. And that's really kind of the main strategic rationale for doing it. Certainly, there's a lot of financial components and Joe will go through all those and we put a lot of those in the deck, but strategically this is a very important transformative situation for Virtu.
I also would say on the agency side, you mentioned Europe one of the key motivators for us wanting to get into the agency execution business was obviously our experiences with order routing for our own selves and how that that value proposition really translated to the agency business. Now with the advent of MiFID II and unbundling it, it just seems like the time is really right for a superior execution only agency offering really to be well accepted by the buy side. And again through our due diligence and understanding the market and talking to customers and what not over the years, we have a great deal of respect for the products that KCG has.
We developed some of our own products, some of our proprietary TCA and transparency products into the way that we route. And we think again by marrying their great institutional client base and the great talents and skills that they have with our technologically advanced if you will order routing capabilities, again we think on that side of the house we can develop a terrific product as well.

Warren Gardiner
Great, thanks. That's really helpful. That's really helpful color. I think just lastly for me. I just think the answer is no, but should we be thinking about any change to the dividend you know as you guys are sort of delevering or not is related but the tax structure as well?
Douglas Cifu
Yeah, great question. The tax structure will say the same and I think we put in the press release that there's no plan for changing dividend as well.
Joseph Molluso
Yeah.
Douglas Cifu
That's obviously…
Warren Gardiner
Okay, I got…
Douglas Cifu
We’ve dealt with that in the capital structure and the – and our partners of J.P. Morgan – and formulating the credit make sure that we have the ability to continue to pay the dividend.
Warren Gardiner
Great, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you, Warren.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm [UBS].
Alex Kramm
Yeah, good morning everyone. Just wanted to come back to you’re guys entering the retail market making space. Maybe you’ve mentioned this at the beginning, but obviously you're entering this business at a time where there's lot of price competition at the end market, you’re seeing swap and others fees a lot. And obviously that’s the lost revenue opportunity for those guys and you could argue that at some point that could trickle through to the market making community and in particular if you think you're going to make more money in trading the order flow, some of those guys might want to share the upsides, right. So how do you feel comfortable that that business is not a race of zero in particular there's competition in the end market?
Douglas Cifu
Yeah, it's a great question. And I think the way we do business is to be transparent and collaborative with our business partners. We've done that throughout since we started Virtu. So obviously I need to get to know these folks. I know some of them very well. And I know the great folks at KCG that have interacted with them, for years I have a terrific relationship with them. I think this is a win-win for those customers because at the end of the day we're going to bring the efficiency and scale that Virtu is known for to that business. And so we can make that a more efficient business and make it a better experience. At the end of the day is there going to be an adult conversation about how does that shared and ultimately how does the end use of the retail and the institutional investor that are using the services of a Schwab or et cetera, how are they going to benefit from this. That's really the most important thing.
We think we can drive execution quality. We think we can continue to reduce cost because that's what we did – already kind of what we do. We've been one of the proponents of competing at lower spreads and dealing with rising costs in the competitive all to all market. So we think that this is a key moment in time for this segment of the business to get more efficient and to hone in skill. So look at the end of the day, we're all adults, we’re all in business to make money but at the end you need to provide a superior product to the end user and I'm very confident that this will be a win-win for the fantastic customer base at KCG.
Alex Kramm
Alright, thank you. That’s helpful. And then just secondly, I guess this is for Joe. Can you talk a little bit more on the technology synergy as the [indiscernible] there? I don't know KCG that well anymore, but I feel like there were a lot of acquisitions and obviously get go KCG coming together a few years ago, but from what I understand not much more integrated maybe they're like four different training platforms or more. So where are you heading I mean is the roadmap to find already, is this going to be a Virtu backbone over time or is one of those situation both wake up and you actually realized you can't integrate as much because you don't know what happens when you shutdown one system and there's a lot of risk involved. So how comfortable are you with the technology movement? And actually what are you seeing there internally that might be very efficient?

Joseph Molluso
Yeah, look – when you look at how we've detailed the synergies, we've broken out 70 million of technology communications and data processing synergies. The first step there is just kind of identifying redundant paths – redundant telecommunication paths around the globe. KCG has done a great job managing that and I think we’ve done a great job managing that. And this is an area where you can literally look at contracts and services and data contracts and what they pay for market data, what we pay for market data and there are just direct redundancies there. And that’s what’s represented in that number.
So that $70 million that we called out is just cost savings associated with redundant technology infrastructure data processing that we think is very achievable. It’s very similar to what Virtu did when it acquired Madison Tyler in 2011. I think to your point to know about the overall technology platform and systems, I think that will be a phased process. I think ultimately the goal is to have one technology platform, but there are a lot of different areas to look at. And I think they will build the benchmarks within 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, but I think from the customer experience at KCG there's not going to be anything that changes in the near-term or the intermediate term like there will be no overhaul of technology immediately that will change anything related to the important customer franchise.
Douglas Cifu
Yeah, I think that's the most important point that Joe just made, which is as far as the customer experiences we get how important that is and that the interaction with the KCG environment right now is superior and we don't want to change that. What happens behind the scenes if you will as behind the wall? And we really always pride ourselves as you all know in having a single integrated platform that’s multi-asset class, multi-currency and you can – all of our offices in the way we operate are 100% seamless and interchangeable. We're going to bring that scale and efficiency to what KCG has to offer to the customers. That will be behind the scenes if you will, but absolutely at the end the day that's why we have been able to be as successful as we are in terms of having a scale plan.
Alex Kramm
Okay, so if I hear you right the $70 million in technology savings is really just I guess the duplication in market data and there should probably be upside if we actually end up cleaning up the backbone. Did I hear you right there, Joe?
Joseph Molluso
It’s duplicated market structure and its duplicated telecommunications. Yes.
Alex Kramm
Okay. And then just one quickly at the end here as well, in terms of the leverage, you said you can delever quickly. What do you think long-term this company should be running at in terms of leverage in multi…
Joseph Molluso
I think that today we're around 2.25 to 2.50 and that's where we think we had to.
Alex Kramm
All right.
Joseph Molluso
So based on – if you look at our leverage profile today, we did a refinancing of our debt in the fall. And our message was that this is the right long-term leverage level for the company. And I think what we've identified is a 12-month path here, 18-month path where we can return to that proper capital structure.
Alex Kramm
All right that’s it from me then. Thank you.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you very much.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu [Credit Suisse]
Christian Bolu
Hello.
Joseph Molluso
Good morning, Christian.
Christian Bolu
Good morning. Apologies if I missed this, but could you talk about what the cost to achieve synergies and then fully integrated KCG are?
Joseph Molluso
Yeah, the cost to achieve synergies here we haven't outlined them. We will naturally be – as we achieve these synergies around telecommunications, around occupancy and leases, we're going to be having kind of a one-time write-off. So we haven't fully identified the total charge and separated that between cash or non-cash. But I will tell you as a rule of thumb something that is in between half and 50% and 100% of the fully phased-in run rate as a one-time charge would not surprise me.

Christian Bolu
Okay and that's a cash charge that that…
Joseph Molluso
No, it will be cash and non-cash. It will be cash and non-cash.
Christian Bolu
Can you give the splits of cash and non-cash? I’m really trying to understand the cash bit.
Joseph Molluso
We’ll be providing more detail on that. I think the non-cash part will be the greater number.
Christian Bolu
Okay.
Joseph Molluso
Non-cash part will be the greater number just because as you capitalize long-term leases and as you capitalize real estate and things like that, those numbers tend to be bigger. And then as you cancel contracts or if you have any reductions in force, the way we've modeled it anyway that’s the smaller part of it and those tend to be the cash items.
Christian Bolu
Okay, thanks. And can you just help me understand why you raised $750 million equity and $1.65 billion in debt to fund $1.4 billion deal. What's the delta between…
Joseph Molluso
Delta is our – we’re refinancing. So the delta is that two companies have $1 billion of debt on them today. So we have to refinance both of those pieces of debt. And so the incremental – so you have your numbers right Christian, but just think of the debt as an incremental $600 million.
Christian Bolu
Got you, okay. That’s helpful. And then the 25% accretion just unclear, that does include – that does factoring the impact of the equity offering, right.
Joseph Molluso
It does. It does.
Christian Bolu
Okay, perfect. And just lastly – and I think you tried to mention – you didn’t talk about this earlier on. I guess one could argue again to how exactly the same thesis or very similar thesis to you when it’s KCG and profitability has been somewhat tough. Maybe just help me understand very big picture wise what's different this time? How you’d approach the integrating – to come to a better or long-term outcome?
Douglas Cifu
I wasn't there and I have no real idea. Obviously, I read from the news clippings and things like that that you did. All I know is how we operate and how I'm going to approach this transaction. And to be blunt, we have a lot more to learn from KCG then KCG has to learn from us. And these guys have been in a tremendous business and have served the market ably for two decades. And so we're going to go in there very humbly and say guys we really want to understand how you will operate. We think we can help you make it better and let's be collaborative and work together.
We are a lean and mean management team here. It’s Joe and myself and some other folks sitting in this conference room. We're not going to go in there, guns blazing and say it's our way at our highway. We're going to go in and really try to learn and be collaborative. I'm 100% convinced that there are literally hundreds of very, very talented people at KCG that will kind of get the way that we want to run this business. We’ll be excited about creating a truly integrated financial services firm. And we think that we can build the best-in-class market-making and agency business that can be competitive and that can be sustainable and can provide a better customer experience. And most importantly for our investors, we’ll continue to drive significant margins and profitability.
So that's kind of the best that we can do, which is to be humble, to try to learn and try to get the best out of both firms and integrate them in the right way. We’ve had the experience of doing that with Madison Tyler, which was a very significant market-making firm that we merged with in 2011. And the most important thing that I learned from that transaction is it's not often that – it's not Virtu and Madison Tyler, it’s us. And so at the end of day, it's not going to be Virtu and KCG and I don't care where you came from, the best people will be promoted, the best people will be on the management committee and the best people will continue to grow and learn with the firm as I will. So we're really looking forward to the experience.

Christian Bolu
Okay, thank you very much for the detailed answer.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen [Buckingham].
Chris Allen
Good morning guys.
Douglas Cifu
Good morning, Chirs.
Joseph Molluso
Hi.
Chris Allen
Apologies if I missed – missed some of this in redundant, but I just had a couple of different questions. One, the 25% accretion is that for fiscal 2018 or 2019, I am just trying to…
Joseph Molluso
The way we presented here in the deck, Chris, is really what we've tried to do is say look you have your own view of Virtu, you have your own view of KCG, no matter what scenario you model. The moving pieces are going to be kind of what is the net cost savings and what is the incremental interest expense.
So naturally if you modeled it right out of the box where we haven't paid down net debt in the first quarter it's still accretive, but what we've done here is say look on a fully phased-in what’s the right capital structure scenario, it is over 25% accretion. So the example we've given on Page 10, it says its 2019, which shows 2019 just because it's the full second year and we're assuming we closed in Q3, but it doesn't have to be. You can pick any year. You can plug-in any numbers you want that you'll come up with for KCG and Virtu. And when you plug-in the synergy number even with higher amounts of incremental interest expense, it is meaningfully accretive.
Chris Allen
So you’re using 2019 consensus. Is that right for the 25%?
Joseph Molluso
Yes, I mean, if you’re plugging 2019 consensus, I think you’re going to get something even higher.
Chris Allen
Okay. And then just kind of the – I know it’s two years the fully phased-in synergies, I’m just trying to think about how that kind of liked that in over those two years kind of – I mean how long is the development work needed on your side to be able to implement the KCG strategies or are do you utilizing some of those? I’m just trying to reconcile that to kind of make sure we're not going too quickly in terms of the synergy build outs.
Joseph Molluso
I think just in terms of the actual number that that we put out there it’s like Chris simplifying assumption that that would work is just 50:50, 50% year one and then 100% in year two.
Douglas Cifu
And Chris just a little more color on. I think there are a lot of things that are going to be day one like we obviously don't have to pay my favorite topic, market data fees and things like that. Those are day one tiering benefits. Those are day one consolidating flow within legal entities to reduce brokerage costs. Those are all day one. We've a lot of experience from having done that in the Madison Tyler Virtu transaction where we saw a lot of those day one synergies.
Obviously terming out telecommunication lines and colos and whatnot reducing footprints, migrating strategy on to a single box, so that you can reduce a footprint in a very expensive colo. Those aren't necessarily day one, maybe they are day 30 to day 90 depending upon the term of the actual lease or co-location facility, but they're easily identifiable. In terms of technology and re-platform, what I would point out is that here at Virtu we have a lot of experience being a technology service provider we have an arrangement with a large financial situation on the FX side and then our much ballyhooed arrangement with J.P. Morgan, where effectively we are routing risk for J.P. Morgan in the fixed income world and the U.S. Treasury’s world, right.
So it's not entirely just similar to the situation that we're going to be faced with from an architectural perspective in the KCG environment where they've got this great host of strategies that are very, very complementary to what we do in the customer market making segment. They access the market in a particular way. We are very good at accessing markets. We’re really fundamentally a terrific smart order router as a firm. So taking those intentions, those orders from KCG and routing them through a Virtu environment is something that will be very high on our list and we have real-time experience if you will by doing that as a technology provider already with our friends at J.P. Morgan, so they were terrific test case in terms of how do you access the market when your strategy if you will is now actually coming up with the idea to place a particular order on a particular side of a particular product.

So it's going to take a little bit of time to do that, but we're very confident in our ability to do that. We've already done that as I said before with Madison Tyler and we've done it with a large global financial institution. So in looking at the architecture KCG, we think we can get that done relatively quickly.
Chris Allen
Got it. And then just digging a little on the $440 million of capital synergies, you talked about rationalizing non-core businesses. Does that include potential sale of BondPoint?
Douglas Cifu
No, and to be blunt I mean I don't know a lot about BondPoint other than obviously what I've read. I haven’t met the people and strategically I have to really understand how it fits in to their customer base and how it makes sense. I mean it's a terrific asset. Obviously, I don't know if they do separate financials on it, whatnot. So I’m not going to talk about those here, but the results that I have seen and the growth that I have seen is really a terrific asset and a great product. I understand the market somewhat in terms of credit and credit platforms. I think it's a market leader and what it does I think it's got a lot of potential.
Can we augment the customer experience this through technology through this, that or the other thing I'm not sure. But Joe, myself, the guys at Virtu, we will be very collaborative with the folks at KCG that have the most experience. In particular, we never want to do anything that that has any impact at all in the negative fashion on the customer segments they have. So do their customers rely on it how important is that? So we're going to make that strategic assessment. All I know is it’s a very, very impressive asset and these guys have done a great job running it, they really have.
Chris Allen
Okay and then [indiscernible] $440 million of capital synergy seems to be a pretty big number to me.
Joseph Molluso
Yes.
Chris Allen
Joe you can buckle down between the three bullets you kind of listed in the Page 12 like what's – how that’s broken down between those just I mean if we were to sell BondPoint I would say no problem, you can get it done very easily, but kind of question that number now a little bit.
Joseph Molluso
Yes so just to complete the BondPoint answering, BondPoint really doesn't use any meaningful capital.
Chris Allen
All right, no it just – it can be sold for decent amount of money, so…
Joseph Molluso
Yes, so – no, no, yeah. So that's not included here. And look – Chris, a lot of this is kind of in a very, very detailed due diligence, but there are a number of areas. We've got consolidating businesses within Virtu. I think what that means is kind of we’ve got legal entities – regulated legal entities in Europe and in Asia and in the U.S. as they do, right. So you achieve capital synergies when you move businesses into our own legal entities, all right. We got a separate legal entity setup for proprietary trading and agency trading in Europe, all right. We're going to achieve capital synergies there.
There are a number of things that we dug into in terms of how much capital is used to support different debts and different businesses that are going to be consolidated or rationalized and we've done a very granular, very kind of position by position bottoms up analysis of capital usage and the impact on revenue. So some of that revenue dissynergy is a result of this, but we’ve applied a very kind of Virtu like lens in terms of appropriate returns on capital. And this is what we've come up with.
Chris Allen
Okay, that’s it from me guys. Thanks.
Joseph Molluso
Thank you, Chris. I think operator anymore questions, I don’t believe there are.
Operator
There are no further questions at this time, sir.
Joseph Molluso
Great, thank you everybody. We appreciate everybody assembling on such short notice. And again we really look forward to continue to discuss how this important and accretive transaction will evolve Virtu. And for my friends at KCG, I will be down there later today. I look forward to meeting a lot of you in person. Thank you all.

Operator

          Florida Panthers win NHL draft lottery       









Florida Panthers co-owner Doug Cifu admits his team is bleeding money and that the franchise lost about $114,000 per day last season.
Cifu appeared on TSN 1290 radio in Winnipeg and discussed his team's financial picture in a wide-ranging interview. 
Cifu, who says he was a huge hockey fan growing up on Long Island, NY, admits his team will continue to lose money in 2014-15, but to a lesser extent than a year ago. 






One thing that Cifu and business partner Vincent Viola have done this season is eliminate discounted and complimentary tickets. In this respect, Cifu acknowleges that while attendance is down, the "net intake has not suffered."
However, on Oct. 13, the announced attendance of 7,311 for a game against the Ottawa Senators was the lowest in franchise history.

Shawn Thornton, who signed a two-year deal with the Panthers in the offseason, told DJ Bean of radio station WEEI 93.7 FM that he doesn't pay much attention to the empty seats.
“I’ve played [expletive] Sunday afternoons in Lowell and there was 14 people in the building, and probably eight of them were wives,” Thornton said when reached by phone this week. “I think after nine years in the minors, I don’t really pay attention to the crowd that much anyways when I’m out there. I can block it out.”
Despite the fact that the team continues to lose money, Cifu emphasized that they have actually increased their investment on the hockey operations side. He pointed out that the Panthers' payroll increased over the summer and now sits at around $65 million U.S. 
While the team still has a long way to go on the marketing side, and is often mentioned in musings about relocation, Cifu said he is excited and optimistic about the product on the ice. 


Is it time for the Florida Panthers to relocate?

Virtu Financial is one of the largest high-frequency trading[1][2] (HFT) and market making firms. It provides two-sided quotations and trades in equities, commodities, currencies, options, fixed income, and other securities on over 230 exchanges, markets, and dark pools.[4] Virtu uses proprietary high-frequency trading[1][2] strategies based on big data[5] to trade large volumes of securities. On March 10, 2014, Virtu Financial filed for its initial public offering,[6] yet repeatedly delayed its IPO.[7] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading as a NASDAQ-listed public company on April 16, 2015.

Organization[edit]
Based in New York City, Virtu was founded by Vincent Viola, a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and current owner of the Florida Panthers.[9] Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s CEO since October 2013, co-founded Virtu with Viola in 2008. Cifu is also a co-owner of the Florida Panthers with Viola and serves as the Panthers’ alternate governor. Prior to co-founding Virtu, Cifu was a partner at the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where he practiced corporate law from 1990 to 2008.
The company suggested standards for electronic firms that call themselves market makers. Virtu believes market makers should be obligated to quote at or near the inside of the national best bid and offer throughout the day and quote at various price points in a number of different securities.[10][11] Virtu was ranked as one of the five largest high-frequency traders of equities in Europe in 2011.[12]
In November 2014, Reuters reported that Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Virtu Financial, will succeed William O'Brien as president of BATS Global Markets, a trading venue that was founded by high-frequency traders.[13]
Virtu has offices in New York City (headquarters), Austin, Dublin, and Singapore.[14] It expanded its European headquarters to Dublin in September, 2013.[15] Virtu Financial Ireland Limited is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In May 2011, Virtu merged with proprietary trading firm Madison Tyler based in Santa Monica, California[16][17] with the backing of Silver Lake Partners, a technology focused private equity firm.[18] Vincent Viola co-founded Madison Tyler with David Salomon, a former arbitrage trader at Goldman Sachs.
Virtu acquired a market-making unit that handles NYSE Amex stocks from Cohen Capital Group LLC in December 2011. The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.[19]
In September 2012, Virtu acquired the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker assets of Nyenburgh Holding B.V., a high-frequency trader in European ETFs.[14]
In April 2017, Virtu agreed to pay US$1.4 billion in cash to purchase rival market making firm KCG Holdings. [20]
IPO plans[edit]
Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and "let the storm pass", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date, making the timing of a potential public offering unknown.[7] In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]
When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day.[24]
Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity.[25] In the debate about its near-perfect trading record,[24] Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses.[25] In his research, Laughlin showed that "the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses" which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.[25]
Investigations[edit]
In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running.[26]
In July 2014, Reuters reported the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was seeking information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies.[27] The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices.[27]
John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.[27]

Virtu Financial is one of the largest high-frequency trading[1][2] (HFT) and market making firms. It provides two-sided quotations and trades in equities, commodities, currencies, options, fixed income, and other securities on over 230 exchanges, markets, and dark pools.[4] Virtu uses proprietary high-frequency trading[1][2] strategies based on big data[5] to trade large volumes of securities. On March 10, 2014, Virtu Financial filed for its initial public offering,[6] yet repeatedly delayed its IPO.[7] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading as a NASDAQ-listed public company on April 16, 2015.

Organization[edit]
Based in New York City, Virtu was founded by Vincent Viola, a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and current owner of the Florida Panthers.[9] Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s CEO since October 2013, co-founded Virtu with Viola in 2008. Cifu is also a co-owner of the Florida Panthers with Viola and serves as the Panthers’ alternate governor. Prior to co-founding Virtu, Cifu was a partner at the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where he practiced corporate law from 1990 to 2008.
The company suggested standards for electronic firms that call themselves market makers. Virtu believes market makers should be obligated to quote at or near the inside of the national best bid and offer throughout the day and quote at various price points in a number of different securities.[10][11] Virtu was ranked as one of the five largest high-frequency traders of equities in Europe in 2011.[12]
In November 2014, Reuters reported that Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Virtu Financial, will succeed William O'Brien as president of BATS Global Markets, a trading venue that was founded by high-frequency traders.[13]
Virtu has offices in New York City (headquarters), Austin, Dublin, and Singapore.[14] It expanded its European headquarters to Dublin in September, 2013.[15] Virtu Financial Ireland Limited is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In May 2011, Virtu merged with proprietary trading firm Madison Tyler based in Santa Monica, California[16][17] with the backing of Silver Lake Partners, a technology focused private equity firm.[18] Vincent Viola co-founded Madison Tyler with David Salomon, a former arbitrage trader at Goldman Sachs.
Virtu acquired a market-making unit that handles NYSE Amex stocks from Cohen Capital Group LLC in December 2011. The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.[19]
In September 2012, Virtu acquired the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker assets of Nyenburgh Holding B.V., a high-frequency trader in European ETFs.[14]
In April 2017, Virtu agreed to pay US$1.4 billion in cash to purchase rival market making firm KCG Holdings. [20]
IPO plans[edit]
Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and "let the storm pass", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date, making the timing of a potential public offering unknown.[7] In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]
When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day.[24]
Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity.[25] In the debate about its near-perfect trading record,[24] Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses.[25] In his research, Laughlin showed that "the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses" which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.[25]
Investigations[edit]
In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running.[26]
In July 2014, Reuters reported the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was seeking information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies.[27] The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices.[27]
John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.[27]

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Virtu Financial Conference Call announcing 2016 Fourth Quarter Results. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Andrew Smith, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Andrew Smith
Good morning everyone. Thank you for dialing in. As you know, our fourth quarter results were released this morning and are available on our website. Today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent Virtu's current belief regarding future events and are therefore subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties which may be outside the Company's control, and our actual result and financial conditions may differ materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements.
It is important to note that any forward-looking statements made on this call are based on information presently available to the company and we do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as new information becomes available. We refer you to disclaimers in our press release and encourage you to review the description of risk factors contained our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition to GAAP results, we may refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted net trading income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. You will find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP terms included in the earnings materials with an explanation of how management uses these measures.
Speaking and answering your questions today are Mr. Douglas Cifu, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Joseph Molluso, our Chief Financial Officer. They will begin with prepared remarks and then take your questions.
I would like to now turn the call over to Doug.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining our call this morning to discuss Virtu's fourth quarter and full year results. I am very pleased to report that our global business performed well in the fourth quarter of 2016.
For the quarter, Virtu reported adjusted net trading income of $100.3 million and $0.24 per share of adjusted EPS. The fourth quarter was really a tale of two quarters. October volumes and volatility were similar to the third quarter which was marked by a low volume and mute volatility environment. The U.S. Presidential election in early November brought us some much welcome change to market conditions as we saw an uptick in demand for our market making services across all of our asset classes globally and these positive conditions carried on through the first half of December.
Although the year end was characteristically quiet we are generally pleased with Virtu's solid performance and profitability in this quarter and the full year 2016 given the overall market conditions. We could not have achieved the consistently profitable results in this quarter or the full year of 2016 without our diversified global and scale platform which continues to perform well in all market conditions and as well our relentless focus on cost.
Despite the challenges of a mixed operating environment during much of 2016, I believe the first full year as a public company for Virtu was successful in several respects. First, we maintained what we believe are best-in-class margins for market making firm despite the mixed operating environment and the additional cost and expenses associated with operating as a public company.

Secondly, we broke ground on expanding our technology offerings by launching our technologically driven agency execution business and entering into an agreement with J. P. Morgan to provide outsourced technology and market structure expertise to a part of their U.S. trading operations.
Next, we acquired a minority stake in Japannext and expanded our footprint in the increasingly important Asia Pacific region as the year-over-year growth in our APAC equities business demonstrated.
Next, we acquired strategic telecommunications assets from a trading firm allowing us to stay on the forefront of technological developments in our industry while maintaining cost discipline. Also although there were a number of notable events on the regulatory front, we saw no material negative impact to Virtu's business from anything in the regulatory environment and in fact the finalized method to regulation for example should be a strong positive for our business going forward.
We are optimistic about 2017 and believe with the new pro growth and pro business environment in Washington that the stage is set for the return to a more normalized volume and volatility environment globally and a more sensible regulatory and enforcement environment. As such, we look forward to creating more value for our shareholders in 2017.
Now let me touch on some thoughts related to our business, the environments of 2017 and some strategic initiatives underway at Virtu. With regard to the operating environment it is worth noting that as a technologically enabled market making firm, Virtu's business thrives as natural buyers and sellers in each of the 235 plus marketplaces that we connect to in 36 countries trade. In series of elevated, anticipated or actual volatilities these interactions tend to be more frequent and therefore more profitable.
Measures of anticipated volatility like the VIX and realized volatility were particularly low in the fourth quarter and in particular for the entire second half of 2016. Looking ahead we see reasons to be optimistic with several underlying factors that have the potential to create favorable levels of trading activity including changes in Fed and Global Central bank's policies and the changing regulatory and tax environment that will allow banks and other market participants to increase their trading activity.
In addition, as a fully diversified market making firm, global geopolitical uncertainties, both scheduled and unscheduled will continue to lead to enhanced market-making opportunities for us across markets.
Turning to some strategic initiatives we in started 2016, I'll first talk about our initiatives to offer Virtu's superior routing capabilities to the buy side in equities. Those of you who follow Virtu noticed this has got underway around the time of our IPO when we responded to critics of so-called HFT by engaging directly with various market participants. We demonstrated how Virtu operates with our passive market-making approach in a non-conflicted and technologically enabled manner. I am pleased to report that we now have multiple buy side clients up and running sending us order flow every day.
We have a meaningful queue of customers to onboard and our onboarding client in Europe as well. We believe that the European approach of requiring unbundling of agency services as mandated by MiFID II will only make our non-conflicted routing capabilities more attractive to the buy side.
More importantly, from our perspective the feedback we have received from our customers to date has been outstanding. As you know, this is a competitive marketplace and so far the early feedback we have received fits squarely with how we see the business evolving. We began this business not to compete with long-established market participants who can offer a variety of products and services to clients, but to create an offering with superior capabilities and analytics that we can service in a Virtu way, without incurring meaningful startup cost and profitably operating from day one.

With regard to Technology Services, we continue to be excited about the prospects for this business in the ongoing discussions we are having with potential customers. We believe the time is right for an efficient multi-asset class technological platform like Virtu to be sought after by global financial institutions concerned about future technology spent. The agreement we signed with J.P. Morgan in July for example is up and running and from our standpoint is working quite well. We see great long-term potential with this arrangement based on our early interactions.
We have also been approached by other global financial institutions that seek to understand how our technology, global scale and understanding of markets and market structure might help their businesses and we will continue to explore partnerships like these that enhance shareholder value.
Turning to our investment in SBI Japannext, we stated when we made this acquisition that it was a meaningful opportunity for Virtu to increase its footprint in Asia. So far we are very pleased with the investment. We view the market structure in this part of the world as evolving favorably for us. Although we are not generally disposed to make strategic investments, Japannext has given us the opportunity to have a front row seat participating in and influencing this change in that part of the world.
We view Japannext as the top TCS [ph] in Japan run by a world-class management team and has provided us a unique opportunity to provide our market-making services in a large established market with a top-tier business partner. These interactions contributed to the 11% growth of our APAC equities business from 2015 through 2016 which is an impressive growth in a challenged environment.
Finally, we announced in the fourth quarter our intention to purchase strategic assets, telecommunications assets from a trading firm. We are excited about this acquisition for several reasons. First, it is an example of how the competitive environment in our industry favors large-scale global firm like Virtu. That firm's decision to shift its focus and unwind its proprietary business in favor of an asset management model is a great example of the scale required to compete.
Second, the assets we are acquiring are world-class and will allow us to maintain our superior technological footprint in a cost-effective way and third, along with the purchase we acquired professionals that are already working in Virtu in this area.
We think 2016 was a positive year for the ongoing market structure debate in the United States and globally. A few areas to note. First, we view the Tick pilot as a real success. As a market-maker we have been able to provide more depth of book and quote more names included in the Tick pilot.
Second, we remain supportive of the recent approaches for the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange around new speedbump proposals. As I said in the prior call, we particularly applauded the constructive solution put forth by the Chicago Stock Exchange which we believe would promote greater liquidity and price discovery by protecting the market's liquidity from market participants solely seeking to opportunistically profit from short-term price fluctuations.
We also support the ongoing discussions around the efficacy and necessity of our existing order protection and market access perform and remain committed to working with regulators and other market participants in this area. In particular, we are focused on the recent debate around market data and the current system around selling market data. We continue to believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with how the current system works and the regulators endorsement of global exchange economic models based on charging market participants like Virtu for data that we create in a somewhat noncompetitive fashion.

Outside of U.S. equities we continue to support real-time trace reporting of U.S. Treasuries to bring needed transparency to this. And finally, we welcome the opportunity to work with the CFTC and acting Commissioner Giancarlo in implementing a very sensible regulation 80 [ph]. Overall we believe that the change of administration and attitude towards markets in Washington will be a strong positive for our business in 2017 and beyond.
Despite the mixed environment that persisted for much of 2016, we have reason to be very optimistic about the future. I'll turn to some specific comments about the fourth quarter before turning the call over to Joe for more review and then of course your questions.
Our America's equities category turned in a strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our average daily results were up 29% despite volumes up only 7% and realized volatility coming in 10% lower than Q3. Our European equities category performed similarly well. Together these categories were 30% and 11% of our adjusted net trading income overall for the full year 2016.
While we had a slower quarter in APAC, 2016 was a banner year for our APAC equities category. We completed the aforementioned Japannext investment, expanded our footprint and improved our trading. Our APAC category contributed 12% overall to our 2016 results and we are very pleased with this progress.
As you know, our global FX business has borne the brunt of this recent challenging environment. We saw improvement in our results in the fourth quarter and are optimistic as ever about the future of our FX business after making significant infrastructures and other investments in 2016. Venues more focused on spot volumes which are more pertinent to Virtu's business experienced mixed volume results in the fourth quarter and most were up only modestly while volatility remained quite low.
Our average daily results in the fourth quarter were up 21% versus the prior quarter which outpaced the volumes in the quarter, so we are very pleased with this performance. Our commodities business results in Q3 you will recall included a trading gain from a prior settlement of $3 million. So including the $3 million revenue our global commodities business was generally flat from the prior quarter and in line with volume expectations.
Finally, as Joe will outline, we kept our promise to our investors by managing our expenses during 2016. In addition, our board decided on $0.24 per share dividend payable to shareholders of record on March 01, 2017 making a total of $1.68 per share that we have returned to our investors since our April 2015 IPO. As I have repeatedly said, our Board and Management Team remains committed to returning capital to our shareholders and as such I have seen no reason whatsoever why this policy would be altered in 2017.
Now, we'll turn the call over to Joe, to provide more detail on our results. Joe?
Joseph Molluso
Thank you. GAAP net income for Virtu Financial Inc. after attribution to non-controlling interest was $9 million which equates to $0.22 per share of diluted GAAP EPS. Consistent with the financial presentation and our quarterly and annual results since our IPO we provide non-GAAP Financial information to supplement our presentation.
On a non-GAAP basis our normalized net income was $32.9 million for the fourth quarter. Assuming $139.7 million fully converted shares outstanding, this equated to $0.24 per share in normalized adjusted EPS. Our adjusted EBITDA which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation and other items was $64.8 million for the quarter with a corresponding margin of 62.6%.
Turning to revenues in the overall environment for the fourth quarter our total adjusted net trading income was $100.3 million down 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and up by 6% versus the third quarter. On a full-year basis, adjusted net trading income came in at $414.1 million, down from the record high of $500.7 million in 2015. On a daily basis, adjusted net trading income was $1.592 million per day in Q4. There were 63 trading days in Q4 of 2016.

For the second year in a row, the Americas equities category earned the largest share of adjusted net trading income with 31% of the total for 2016. The fourth quarter was particularly strong for Americas and EMEA equities compared to the third quarter and given the overall environment.
On a share volume basis, U.S. consolidated equity volumes were up 7.2% versus the prior quarter and EMEA notional value traded was up 11.7%. Americas equities and EMEA equities results were up 27% and 19% respectively versus Q3. We are pleased with these results particularly in light of the continued overall poor environment for a market maker like Virtu. The average mix was up slightly in Q4 to 14.1 from 13.2 in Q3. However, realized volatility was down from an already very depressed level in Q3. Further, the ratio of realized volatility to anticipated volatility as measured by VIX was down as well to 63%, the lowest in some time.
The story is similar in Europe where implied volatility and realized volatility were both down versus Q3. In the APAC equities category we ended 2016 with a record $49.9 million of adjusted net trading income. The poor overall environment impacted the results of Q4. However, we are very pleased with the overall progress of this region which contributed 12% of adjusted net trading income in 2016.
Turning to foreign exchange and commodities Q4 was a mixed bag, although we saw overall improvement and entered 2017 on a positive note our commodities results were flat versus Q3 when you exclude this settlement trading gain included in the Q3 results. With regard to foreign exchange, foreign exchange volumes were generally poor in Q4. CME futures contracts and notional amount of trade were up, however more pertinent spot volumes were generally down and in some cases meaningfully down depending on the venue.
As Doug mentioned, our review on the underlying factors that drive volume and volatility is bullish. However, given the unpredictable nature of the operating environment, we strive to operate Virtu to be solidly profitable in all market environments. To do this we maintain a policy of strong expense discipline and focus on cash flow generation.
Our expense management continued to reflect our discipline and we think demonstrates our ability to adjust to the environment. Despite the challenging conditions, our profit margins continue to be among the best of our peer companies. We focus on adjusted EBITDA margin and for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.3% and 62.6% respectively.
On our core expenses which we include as communications and data processing, employee compensation, operations and administration, and depreciation and amortization were $52 million for the fourth quarter and $208.8 million for the full year. We define these categories as core expenses because they represent the fixed cost of operating our business and are therefore somewhat within our control as opposed to brokerage and clearing type expenses with we embed in our trading profits to derive an adjusted net trading income.
On a full year basis, these core expenses were down 3.5% versus full year 2015. Drilling down into the categories our global telecommunications and market data cost came in at $71 million up about 3% from the prior year and in line with expectations. Our operations and administrative expenses were down and our depreciation and amortization line item decreased from $33.6 million in 2015 to $29.7 million in 2016.
We achieved these outcomes with regard to these non-compensation related expense categories through active management, relentless reviews of our business and requirements, particularly related to technology and market data, but also with regard to facilities, operations, benefits, all aspects of our business.

Active management is particularly important with regard to compensation expense. Looking at the results for full-year 2016, our total GAAP compensation expense including stock based compensation declined from $88 million to $85.3 million. Excluding stock-based compensation, compensation costs were $61.5 million down from $68.1 million in 2015. We were able to achieve these results while transitioning to a public company style equity incentive compensation plan for our employees, managing our total headcount which was 146 as of today, while expanding into new businesses and making sure our employees are well compensated and properly incentivized.
The only other notable expense item is the write off of certain expenses related to the refinancing of our long-term debt. As I mentioned on our last call we took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance our debt and when you do this we are required to take a non-cash charge writing off expenses related mainly to the unamortized expenses from the previous term loan and you can see that number is $5.6 million for this quarter.
As you know, the debt refinancing was very successful for Virtu resulting in an extension of the maturity to 2022, the reduction in our LIBOR spread by 100 basis points and decrease in our weighted average interest costs. So we were very happy with this outcome.
Turning to cash and capital we provide some updated supplemental materials for your review as we did last quarter. Our cash and capital position remained strong providing more than adequate capital to run our business and maintain an acceptable cushion. At December 31 we had cash and equivalents of $181.4 million, net cash was $156.4 million. We look at trading capital together with net cash and as you can see our trading capital position at December 31 was $385.7 million. Given the passive market neutral approach we have we do not require substantial amounts of capital to hold or management risk positions. You can see this analysis on slide six of the supplemental materials.
If you look at our EBITDA and income numbers in relation to these capital numbers, you can see that Virtu earns consistently exceptional returns on capital. For example, even in the challenging conditions of 2016 we generated $268.6 million of adjusted EBITDA using yearend trading capital number of $385.7 million, this translates to a 70% return on deployed capital.
From a cash flow standpoint we report normalized adjusted net income and EPS to assume that our company is a fully taxed e-corporation with all of the common units exchange for Class A and B shares in the company, we feel this is a helpful presentation. In order to get a picture of our cash-based results on slide four, as we did last quarter we have adjusted various items that generate or use cash and as you can see the cumulative impact is that we generated $1.99 per share of normalized adjusted free cash flow and declared cumulative dividends of $1.68 per share since our IPO.
We have paid out 88% of our pro forma earnings since IPO. If we cash adjust these earnings we paid out 85% of our normalized adjusted free cash flow. When discussing our payout during our IPO we communicated our intent to keep the payout at least 70% of our earnings.
Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a regular quarterly distribution of $0.24 per share payable March 15 to shareholders of record on March 1.
Now, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Richard Repetto
Yes, good morning, Doug, good morning, Joe.
Douglas Cifu
Good morning Rich.
Joseph Molluso
Good morning.

Richard Repetto
Yes, I guess the first question is, what stands out is the adjusted margins 49% close to 50% and I guess the question is, and it has been asked before, but given the environment why don't your strategies struggle like some of your competitors that were seeing actual losses, quarterly losses?
Douglas Cifu
Well, that’s obviously Rich, I know what we do right, so it’s hard for me to comment on how other firms run their business or what their strategies do and why they react to volatility and rising markets or falling markets in different ways. My theory is and I've articulated this many times, we’re a pure market making firm right? So, we don't have an axe if you will. What we're – our mission is to be the finest increment of the bid and offer and to have a price at every moment in time for the 12,000 financial instruments that we trade. We do that by reference obviously the publicly available market data understanding market structure and having a great technology plan, that’s our mission singly focused. It's what Benny was doing 30 years ago in the trading fit the story and we use technology and scale to provide that efficiency in to the marketplace.
So as a pure market making firm, candidly you should make money in rising and falling markets. Now, obviously, you'll make more money when there is more volume and many times you can make more money as you see in this quarter where there are periods of volatility or increased interest where the bid offer spread will expand, but our mission and our focus and our job if you will is to be a service provider, to provide the financial intermediation in the most efficient way between natural buyers and natural sellers. When you do that and you stick to your knitting and you are consistent and you manage your cost and expenses which Joe just went through, which we did, frankly you should be profitable every quarter as we have been since our inception in, since we started trading in 2009.
Richard Repetto
Understood, that's helpful. And I guess Doug, you did talk a fair amount about the growth initiatives adding several new buy side clients and optimistic in 2017. I guess the question is, is there any way to put some sort of quantitative, how much can this contribute either on a percentage basis or just trying to feel what possible impact it could have on the financials in the coming year, the gross initiatives being the buy side and the partnerships with J.P. Morgan et cetera?
Douglas Cifu
Yes, now look obviously I get it and I know you guys and our investors obviously want to see how can we size that opportunity, how can we grow. We do separately disclose in our Technology Services segment, that kind of we’ve got a couple of technology deals and obviously now we have an agency business. So it all kind of get’s lumped in there and we get at the right moment in time as that business grows we’ll provide more detailed color on it.
But I stick with the comments and the statements that I've made on these calls and in other public forum which is we think that’s a meaningful opportunity. We've had great take-up from world-class institutions that frankly we’re very humbled to be in business with and you know some of the names that have been out there in the press. And in terms of sizing it we think it can certainly be 10% of our overall results.
Now the one thing that I'm not going to get boxed into is to say, hey how is that going to scale out quarter-by-quarter? And I get it. It’s important for the modelling and what not and people to look at the evaluation and I'm cognizant and respectful of that, but we think this is a real opportunity and we’ve had great uptake and I think the thing that I want people to be focused on is like we are running those businesses as it were two business.

We have it ramped up with hiring a bunch of new employees and scale and new technology. We haven't made any meaningful investments in there because we frankly don't have to. What we have discovered is that we are a great financial technology company that really understands market structure because we have to make markets in these markets.
And so I think that's a very unique asset if you will that we have and the business partners that we are now doing business with who are very discerning consumers and have frankly their choice to any financial technology company out there in the world, recognize that differentiation. We’re not going to be commoditized. We’re not going to be the cheapest option, but if you want a firm that really has built a great technological plan, is very efficient, is on the cutting edge, but really also understands 235 plus markets in 36 countries we might be the guy to do business with. And so we think that value proposition does scale, it does scale in a Virtu way and we'll continue to pound it and hopefully you’ll see the quarter results increase.
Richard Repetto
Thanks. That’s all I had Doug and Joe and good luck in 2017.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you, Rich.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Chris Allen
Hey guys how are you doing? And I guess we can just start on cash equities business, if you could just give us may be some color in terms of what drove the performance relative to, I mean we kind of look at the realized volatility metric, I don’t know if there is strength in ETFs or some other element there and also how the start to 2017 is so far?
Douglas Cifu
Yes, I mean thanks Chris. Good question. I think obviously when I said it in my comments I mean the somewhat I guess the price, I don’t want this to be a political comment because it’s not, the surprise election of President Trump and the ripple effects of that obviously had a very positive impact on our U.S. equities business during the quarter.
I think the significant thing about that event was, unlike Brexit, which was limited to a day or two or three, Chris we did see a significant interest and uptick if you will in our market-making services as it is obviously seen by the results and the increased capture rate and all the other stuff that you guys will model out during the quarter. And again, as a leading and you hit it right on the head, as a leading ETF market maker, when you've got people shifting portfolios, when you've got people particularly on the night of the elections but also the next five, six, ten trading days thereafter making fundamental decisions on what does this mean for my portfolio.
And a lot of that is driven by ETP products that we happen to be very active in and very efficient in, that’s going to have a significant impact on our operating results in a particular segment, in a particular quarter.
So it’s really, that was really the offshoot of it and again it’s just beat the drum again, that’s the business model, like try to be everywhere and be the best fit and the best offer in all these different asset classes, in geographies and you'll get rewarded. Obviously we saw an uptick in the FX business as well.
Some of that was related to the improvements and the investments that we've made in terms of personnel and technology, but also obviously the ripple effects from the Trump presidency certainly helped that business.
January has been interesting, obviously coming off the increased volumes in volatilities in November and the first couple of weeks of December we were anticipating that January would hopefully be a more active month. You guys see the numbers and whatnot. I think there's been a fair degree of uncertainty as to where the Trump Presidency policies will come out in the areas of tax in particular and maybe some of the regulatory structure.

So that uncertainty I think unfortunately has meant that there is less natural buyers and natural sellers and less portfolio shifting in the market and you guys see the volumes in January which have been somewhat muted and not as, not as robust as we saw in November. But it's still very early days in the quarter and I'm an optimistic guy by nature, but certainly, January you guys see the numbers from all the exchanges have been somewhat lower than what we saw in November and in the first part of December.
Chris Allen
Got it, that’s it from me guys, thanks.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Alex Blostein
Hey guys, good morning.
Douglas Cifu
Good morning.
Alex Blostein
I was hoping you could give us an update on the J.P. Morgan relationship. I think it's been a couple quarters since the announcement came out. I think in the past you guys talked about expanding into potentially other asset classes there as well. So may be just an update on how that's gone so far and what sort of next we should expect from that relationship?
Douglas Cifu
Well, look as with every relationship you've got to date a little bit before you get engaged, before you get married. So I think, look I mean they are terrific people. I think the great results have been I think culturally and ergonomically the firms fit very, very well together. Obviously there was a period where we had to get our systems to speak and compliance and all that kind of stuff.
That's all now behind us and we're actively engaged in working with them to enhance their market-making capabilities and in active treasuries and what not. I'm really not going to comment on kind of where it goes from there. I mean, I think it’s way too early days Alex. I mean, we’re humbled and honoured to be candid with you to be in business with such an important financial institution. We've learned a lot from them and hope they've learned a lot from us in terms of how they operate and I think they've hopefully learned on how a smaller may be more nimble firm operates. So, I think there's a lot of great synergies there.
But in terms of where the relationship goes, I think it's still early days. I mean we’ve got a multiyear relationship with them, multiyear partnership. It does, you know, it's represented in our financial results where you'll see some uptick in 2017, but I think it’s again and I’ve said this on multiple calls, I think it's a great sign of how large terrific financial institutions that have customers and capital and all the wonderful things that banks have, can partner with very nimble financial technology firms that happens in our market structure very well. So I continue to be very enthused about the partnership.
Alex Blostein
Got it, thanks. My other quick question was just around the tax reform and obviously it’s early days and nobody quite knows where things will shake out. But for you guys specifically, given the obvious new structure and kind of the way you account for taxes on an adjusted basis, if the tax rate were to go down to something let's say in the mid-20s range, can you give us a sense I guess like, how that would impact your adjusted results?
And then more importantly, how does that impact the way you think about the spreads, I guess whether your competitiveness on the pricing side meaning that does that create a special opportunity because you guys have a lot of scale already and section enables you to provide pricing I guess in a tighter spread?
Douglas Cifu
Yes, in my prior life I used to be a lawyer, pretend I was a great tax lawyer but I actually wasn't. So I’m actually going to ask Joe to give a better answer than I could on what it means for our tax rate.

Joseph Molluso
No, you are right Alex, if the corporate tax rate all things being equal goes from the statutory rate 35 to a statutory rate of 25 we will benefit from that by 10% in terms of how we book taxes. I think the devil is always in the details and we presented on a pro forma basis because we think that’s the right way to do it and we think it – the right way to value the company is to assume we’re not in a structure and where, it fully taxed C-corp.
So we would see no reason to generally the statutory rate is kind of where your effective rate hovers and we would expect that we would be right around the new statutory rate. And I know there's a lot of detail, lot of things being discussed about having more to do with manufacturing companies probably in a company like that, but we would, we would welcome our public company as a C-corp and pays s corporate taxes, so we would welcome that lower rate.
Douglas Cifu
The only other comment Joe I would make is I should point out, our offshore operations are based in two lower corporate tax rate jurisdictions. So were in Ireland and in Singapore and both those rates are 12.5 and Singapore 15 or 17 dependent upon what the category is. So as a global company if the new Washington if you will lowered the corporate tax rates to 20% to 25% it really would help us as well because our offshore profits are below that. So we would have to move things around and restructure.
And I think you also asked like how has it impacted the bid offer. I mean, I think one of the things that does not get talked about is, there is actually a financial transaction tax in the United States. It is called the Section 31 fee they call it a fee not a tax. But I'll tell you what, it is a tax. It definitely impacts where we can make bid offer spread and it impacts our profitability. It shows up in our variable expense line. So, people don’t talk about a lot, but it's pretty significant. I know it allegedly goes to fund the SEC and the excess goes to the “Treasury” but it is a big part of the bid offer spread. And candidly if that fee was reduced in a new administration with the new SEC Chairman taking a look at it, I mean that would actually help our U.S. equity results considerably.
Alex Blostein
Got it. That’s very helpful. Thanks guys.
Douglas Cifu
Yes, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is open. 
Ken Worthington
Hi, good morning. As we think about 2017 and the FX business, maybe talk a little bit about what are your priorities for kind of continuing to get that business to recover? NTR is still sort of, well below levels of experience over the last couple of years. I guess maybe how are you thinking about adjusting to both the ongoing market structure changes that the FX environment is sort of going through and then adjusting to just the lower levels of volatility, are there other things you can kind of invest in and due to kind of grow NTR to those prior levels?
Douglas Cifu
Yes, good question and I think, the further like I’ll say fragmentation efficiency the FX market actually is something that does, will and does favor a firm like Virtu. One of the things that we did in 2016 and we’ve seen some success already was further automate and scale that business. Five years ago, six years ago when we were trading FX and I have said this publicly and privately before, was we had access for cash platforms and the CME. Scroll forward to 2017 and there is literally dozens of platforms and brokers that we can make markets to for further dissemination of our price and our product offering has scaled considerably. So applying for Virtu automation and regular if you will to that asset class that's something that we really focused on in 2016 and we started to see some of the benefits in 2017.

I think as that asset class becomes more transparent, as you see more competitors, as you perhaps see more kind of real-time price dissemination, as if you actually saw some type of centralized clearing, again I’m speculating, there is nothing in the works, all of those things Ken in terms of market structure are going to benefit Virtu because it’s going to start to feel a lot more like an equity style business than more of a bilateral spoke type of business and that’s obviously very good for uss.
I think some of the other regulatory challenges like we're a significant market maker in the swaps products. If that becomes easier and under Dodd-Frank to do onshore in a competitive stuff environment, it is not that easy to do right now. It’s one of the unintended consequences I think of Dodd-Frank. I think that could be a significant uptick to us. So expanding the repertoire of pairs that we effectively make markets in maybe some, I'll call it sensible reformation of Dodd-Frank to enable more competition, I think there are a lot of unintended consequences in the FX market around Dodd-Frank.
I think people can look at that and say, hey this really probably wasn't the driver of the financial crisis and Dodd-Frank has made it more difficult and more challenging for both dealers and non-dealer market makers to participate in certain type of products. So if there is some sensible reformation I’ll say at Washington that’s probably positive to our business, but again this is not a business where we’re going to go directly to buy side counterparties.
We were very comfortable with the relationships we have with the big dealers. We’re not going to scale out and have a sales force and all that kind of stuff. I think there is a lot of room for a very efficient market maker like Virtu to take our prices and effectively redistribute them through business partners whether we call it banks, technology providers or exchanges, or ECNs whatever you want to call them, there is a lot of room for growth there.
Ken Worthington
Great, thank you very much.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from William Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jack Keeler
This is Jack Keeler filling in for Bill. Thanks for taking the questions this morning.
Douglas Cifu
Yes, good morning.
Jack Keeler
First one on the Technology Services business, you mentioned you've had conversations with other financial institutions, just kind of curious how much of this has been you guys still being inbound calls versus reaching out to these institutions and I know you just mentioned about the sales force, I know it’s kind of an un-Virtu thing to do, but do you have any dedicated salespeople and is that something you would think about doing in the future?
Douglas Cifu
Yes, I mean I guess on the lean salesman of Virtu not to be too flipping, but no, again there aren’t, it is not like there are 100 customers. I mean you could probably name on one or two hands the large financial institutions. I think the great news is because we're in the market and because we have relationships with your employer and just in every employer that’s on the phone and others that we do business with either as a trading partner or prime brokerage customer over the years and we have those relationships.
So these were all inbound calls because obviously when there is noise around us entering into arrangements and doing various things, I think that raises eyebrows in corridors in the institutions and people say, hey I want to know what’s going on. Might this make sense for me to do something as well?
And so, I think our reputation with most or all these financial institutions is stellar because we are transparent fully regulated market maker and we've had really good business relationships with these folks over the years. So, these aren’t commoditized products. We're looking for strong strategic partnerships. I know I'm being vague intentionally, but you kind of get it which is large institutions look at the efficiency scale and market structure, expertise that we can bring. Those are areas within large financial institutions that I understand having talked to executives at these financial institutions where they are kind of trying to figure out what they do and how they can become more efficient in providing services to their customers.

We’re all trying to solve the same problem which is markets are getting more efficient and end-users are demanding efficiency in pricing. It seems like a natural fit because we as a general matter don't have customers, don't have relationships with the buy side, don't have research, don’t have IPO accounts, all those wonderful things that large financial institutions have and have developed over frankly centuries, it would be silly for us to try to compete with that and we would never do that.
But how can you marry the efficiency scale and market structure expertise that we have with all the fantastic things that a large financial institution can bring? We've done that now in a couple of instances and might there be opportunity to do that again, absolutely.
Jack Keeler
Got it. Thanks and what are your thoughts can you give any, is there any color you could give on the pipeline for future Technology Services deals, is this something that you have conversations ongoing or is it in the future if more came out you would be interested in doing it?
Douglas Cifu
I mean they are certainly ongoing as I said in my script, which means that we're in talks with people. They are at various stages though. Hey tell me what you guys do, does it make sense to let’s try something out, so you could see it this might work. Again, I don’t want to sit here and promise and say we’re going to sign up two of them in 2017 and this and that.
What I've said is, this is not going to be a couple of dozen of business partners. We're a small firm and when we do these things we do them very intensely because we want to prove that we can really provide value to the business partners. This isn’t a question of setting up some commoditized technology, algo, licensing kind of business. There are plenty of firms that do that and I assume do it very, very well.
What we can offer is really a holistic understanding of technology and market structure which we think is kind of unique because I feel the way that we make money understanding the markets and being really efficient. And if we can partner with somebody that needs that efficacy and understanding in a very, very efficient, not off the shelf kind of manner and we think it - and it works for them and it works for us we’ll do it. But again, I'm not going to sit here and promise that it will be X, Y, and Z over the next number of quarters because I think that would candidly be irresponsible.
Joseph Molluso
And remember just as you look at this, as you look at our financials as you see as we pointed out the Technology Services is where these revenues develop and the agency execution piece of it were developed hopefully in a more steady way as we kind of onboard customers as and that's just the equity, agency execution piece. I think what you are asking about is more the Technology Services/outsourcing which by nature is going to be lumpier.
Jack Keeler
Got it. Thanks guys and then Joe, just a question for you, obviously the expense for access [ph] was pretty strong year-over-year in 2016 and while it was a pretty challenging environment, if you see a similar environment in 2017 was there any kind of delayed spend or delayed investment 2016 that you are planning to use in 2017 instead or could you kind of stay at kind of run rate levels as the environment challenged?
Joseph Molluso
The answer to your question is no. There is not anything that we, that we did not report on expenses, any deferred expenses any delayed expenses and I would say emphatically yes, we can maintain the run rate and we will do what we have to do adjust the environment even if it got worse. So, we do have continued for us and we feel strongly, you've got to be able to make money in all kinds of environments including the quite core environment in the third quarter and fourth quarter.

Jack Keeler
Got it, thanks for taking my questions guys.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you, Jack.
Operator
Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Douglas Cifu for any closing remarks.
Douglas Cifu
Thank you very much, operator. Again, we thank everyone for their interest in Virtu and for a very successful 2016. We look forward to even more success in 2017. Thank you everybody.
Operator
