What are analysts saying about Air Products and Chemicals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Air Products and Chemicals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Air Products’ second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales rose by double-digits year over year, and beat expectations. Air Products has a strong project backlog and benefits from cost-reduction measures and a diverse customer base. Moreover, acquisitions, strategic investments and new business deals are expected to continue to support results in fiscal 2017. However, the company’s industrial gases business in the EMEA region is seeing pressure from a weak operating environment. The company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand. Moreover, volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak while LNG sales remain under pressure due to low project activity. The company is also exposed to currency headwinds." (5/1/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "KMI will hold an Analyst Conference in Houston on Jan. 25th to review operations, discuss strategic initiatives, and profile financial guidance. We expect mgmt to detail 2017 financial projections, expanding upon preliminary estimates it offered in December. Moreover, we anticipate significant discussion of its $12B project backlog and efforts to potentially partner on certain assets and/or otherwise work to minimize risk while extracting value. 2017 guidance. On Dec. 5th, KMI initiated 2017 adjusted EBITDA & DCF guidance of ~ $7.2B and ~$4.46B, respectively, and noted plans to deploy ~$3.2B on growth initiatives with anticipated YE leverage of ~5.4x (debt/EBITDA). As is its historic custom, we expect mgmt to greatly expand upon this preliminary outlook at its Analyst Conference and anticipate segment-specific forecasts will be forthcoming. As KMI remains focused on achieving leverage targets consistent with a return to dividend growth, we believe investors will explore mgmt’s expectations for big-ticket projects, legacy asset declines, and ongoing JV initiatives."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations.

 Career History



Investment Counsellor

                                    Current                


Highstreet Asset Management, Inc.


                  Highstreet Asset Management (HAM) believes that earnings and earnings growth drive stock prices. Their pursuit for growth is balanced with a commitment to value.They adhere to a rigorous buy and sell discipline. Portfolio holdings are constantly monitored to ensure that the fundamental attributes that made a security desirable for purchase still exist. The firm believes that if their equity portfolios always have a better earnings profile than the market, a better valuation profile than the market and higher quality than the market, then they will beat the market.HAM's philosophy of indexing bonds is founded on research that demonstrates that active bond management is not worth the risk. Bonds purchased are assessed on the following attributes: market yield, price risk and credit worthiness.In managing the balanced fund, they believe that trying to time the markets does not add value. The chosen asset mix for this fund is the result of research using historical risk and return relationships.HAM measures and manages risk each day to ensure that it is consistent with their investment objectives and with the level of risk their clients have asked them to take. Some of the simple and intuitive risk measures they focus on are volatility of the fund relative to the benchmark, probability of outperforming the benchmark and frequency of loss.Though not limited by sector HAM tends to invest in the stocks of Canadian and US companies in the finance, energy minerals and non-energy minerals sectors. The firm maintains a medium turnover rate.

                  Salida Capital Corp. is an aggressive growth manager that seeks to provide superior absolute performance over the long term. Their objective is to offer investments that provide relatively low correlation to traditional and alternative investments and that provide relatively low correlation to each other. Their strategies include Long/Short Equity, Convertible and Fixed-Income Arbitrage, Merger Arbitrage, Event Driven or Special Situations, Opportunistic, Systematic, Distressed Securities, Capital Structure Arbitrage and Multi-Strategy.Salida's Long/Short Equity strategy starts with a macro view on their desired net market exposure (net long, net short or market neutral). Bottom up fundamental research drives their stock selection process. They seek to identify securities that are mispriced, either over-valued or under-valued, based on the firm's outlook for that particular industry or sector. They also look for a catalyst that changes the outlook for that security within a certain time frame. Positions sizes are based on an assessment of the ratio of risk to potential reward. They examine relative pricing within sectors as well as correlations across sectors to assess risk and to identify opportunities to hedge their long or short investments. Salida mitigates risk or hedge exposure through short sales of stocks or ETFs as well as positions in relevant commodity futures or indices.Salida's Convertible and Fixed-Income Arbitrage strategy begins with a constant screening of the convertible bond and corporate bond universe to identify securities that are mispriced or undervalued relative to their underlying equities. The process involves examining company and industry fundamentals. The number of shares sold short depends on the desired market exposure and is determined by yield curve shifts, dividend yields, as well as the pricing and volatility of the stock.The firm's Merger Arbitrage strategy relies on fundamental stock selection. Salida analyzes public documents, analyst reports and conversations with company officials. If the rewards outweigh the risks, they may take a position, which they may add to if the outcome becomes more certain. They will liquidate the position if the risk/reward relationship deteriorates or if the deal is consummated.Salida's Event Driven or Special Situations strategy looks for opportunities driven by catalyst events or special situations including mergers, hostile takeovers, reorganizations or LBOs. They are particularly interested in event driven situations where they may have a competitive advantage due to their fundamental background or research in one of the firm's core industries.Their Opportunistic strategy seeks to take advantage of investment opportunities that arise from events such as IPOs, sudden price changes caused by events such as an interim earnings disappointment, a news release that impacts the market, hostile bids or market disruptions caused by large blocks or other trading anomalies.Salida's Systematic strategy seeks returns from a variety of liquid global markets including currency, fixed-income, equity, energy, agricultural and metals markets. Both trend following and counter trend strategies are used.Their Distressed Securities strategy involves a long or short investment in equity and/or debt that is deemed overvalued or undervalued. They focus on companies that are in or near bankruptcy or whose securities are trading as if bankruptcy is probable. They employ fundamental analysis including credit recovery analysis to determine the expected future value of the securities. These investments may involve the purchase of the senior bonds of a bankrupt company with the anticipation of either owning a package of post bankruptcy newco debt and/or equity and warrants such that the expected return on capital employed is sufficient. Distressed securities may be sold short when a company's securities are thought to be overvalued and the risk adjusted expected return on capital from being short is attractive.Their Capital Structure Arbitrage strategy employs a varied approach that includes fundamental, credit, prospectus/indenture and trading flows analyses. The process involves the purchase of the layer or layers of the capital structure that is relatively undervalued and to simultaneously sell short those securities that relatively overvalued. The ratio of the hedged portion of the investment is determined using scenario analysis and the resulting expected returns for each security being analyzed to determine the optimal hedge. They consider all parts of the capital structure including loans, senior debt, subordinated debt, secured debt, convertible debt, preferred shares, equity, warrants as well as other related derivative securities.Salida's Multi-Strategy approach is a blend of all their other strategies. The approach is diversified by employing various strategies simultaneously to realize short and long term gains. They seek to overweight or underweight different strategies to capitalize on current investment opportunities.

Investment Philosophy and Approach:
Highstreet believes that stock market success can be achieved by consistently applying a disciplined, quantitative approach to investing. The mandate follows a GVQ+RTM philosophy focusing on strong growth, value, quality and risk attributes. Using a proprietary portfolio management system, Highstreet screens and ranks the universe of stocks and the portfolio holdings according to their GVQ+RTM characteristics. A rigorous buy and sell discipline ensures that the GVQ+RTM criteria for a strong investment and risk profile is maintained. While the process is mostly quantitative, Highstreet supplements the data provided by the models with research and ongoing fundamental analysis.
