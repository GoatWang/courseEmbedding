*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

“Smart Trust is without doubt one of the most powerful and seminal books of our age” (Warren Bennis).After illustrating the global relevance of trust with his book The Speed of Trust by selling more than one million copies in twenty-two languages, Stephen M. R. Covey again illuminates the hidden power of trust to change lives and impact organizations in Smart Trust. In a compelling and readable style, he and long-time business partner Greg Link share enlightening principles and anecdotes of people and organizations that are not only achieving unprecedented prosperity from high-trust relationships and cultures but—even more inspiring—also attaining elevated levels of energy and joy.     The sustainable success these leaders and enterprises are exhibiting is paradoxically being produced in what has proved to be the lowest trust climate in years, if not decades. Smart Trust shows what they are doing and the five actions they are commonly taking to prosper, against the odds, in the same circumstances causing so many others to fail.     With penetrating insights illuminated by their unique access to many of the world’s most successful leaders and organizations, the authors lay out a breakthrough process and skill set in a practical and actionable formula that makes trust a performance multiplier for leaders, teams, organizations, and even countries. They show why trust is fast becoming the most consequential life and leadership skill of our time—a career-critical competency required to navigate and compete in this perilous twenty-first-century interdependent, global economy. Covey and Link teach how to cut through traditional either/or thinking to extend “Smart Trust,” enabling you to exercise sound judgment in a low-trust world by minimizing risk and maximizing possibilities.     Smart Trust has met the strict scrutiny of business leaders around the globe and is validated by research from multiple sources that confirms that high-trust organizations outperform low-trust organizations by nearly three times. Smart Trust shares findings that verify how enduring success, vitality, and happiness are directly related to the level of trust in our relationships—whether in our professional or personal lives.      Find out why trusted people are more likely to get hired or promoted, get the best projects and bigger budgets, and are last to be laid off. This sea-changing book will forever shift your perspective as it reveals and validates, once and for all, the transformational power of trust. Reading Smart Trust will increase your probability of thriving in this increasingly unpredictable marketplace. The more unpredictable it becomes, the more your (and your organization’s) sound judgment and ability to trust in this low-trust world will give you a tremendous competitive advantage—and the capacity to navigate the uncertainty low trust creates.

I won this in a Goodreads Giveaway and was really happy to. I try to read as many business books as I can, although this book would really apply to a lot of areas of our lives. The writing, as expected from these two authors, was great but the ideas were even greater. Trust is such a tenuous thing, and it's hard to invest in things we can't see, but this book makes a great case for it! Highly recommended...

 I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads. My initial interest in it was not for myself....when I saw the book in the giveaway, I thought of my father-in-law and husband, who both enjoy Stephen Covey's books. When the book showed up in my mailbox, I decided to start the book the next day. Although I am in education, not business, I realized that many of the principles this book discusses can be applied in the business world, in the education world, and in life at home.  The premise of this book is declared right away (incorporating the authors’ own suggestion to declare intent): “They [people and companies] can sense that their lives would be a lot better, their jobs a lot more fulfilling, and their personal relationships a lot more joyful if they could only operate in an environment of high trust” (page 3). The book is divided into three parts to address this issue. The first section sets up the problem with statistics and examples of low trust. The question is posed regarding if a lack of trust hurts companies and countries economically. This section also introduces Smart Trust: “a competency and a process that enables us to operate with high trust in a low trust world. It minimizes risk and maximizes possibilities. It optimizes two key factors: (1) a propensity to trust and (2) analysis” (page 57). The next section discusses how individuals and companies can enact Smart Trust, giving multiple examples of companies and individuals who did just that. The final section challenges readers to establish Smart Trust as well as summarizes the previous two parts. Throughout the book, the text is broken up by graphs, images, and key quotes. The graphs, images, and a few quotes are helpful. However, I found that most of the quotes only served to disrupt the flow of my reading, and I eventually started skipping those quotes all together. Since I am sure the authors purposely chose those quotes, I would suggest that perhaps the quotes at the end of the section would be more beneficial. On the other hand, I liked the anecdotes from the authors’ personal experiences that were placed throughout the book, even if they interrupted the text. This book would probably be a great book for a small group within a company to read, meet, discuss, and implement actions suggested in the book. Each chapter ends with insightful questions that could lead to business-altering (and life-altering) reflection and answers.  Overall, this book managed to capture and keep my attention. I was left with the desire to personal reflect on the ideas presented within the book. What can I do to build a culture of Smart Trust?

I read this book as the monthly selection of the Credit Union Leaders Book Club group on LinkedIn.This is an expansion of the last chapter in the author’s prior book “The Speed of Trust.” It contains numerous examples in each chapter along with many great quotes and extensive notes at the end of the book.The first chapter deals with The Paradox. The authors raise some interesting issues in regards to a crisis of trust in the world and its overall impact using different examples and quotes. It also presents hope for building trust.Chapter two deals with Blind Trust or Distrust and addresses the dangers of blind trust (being too trustful) and distrustful (not being trustful enough). The authors discuss how society causes blind trust or distrust to develop within individuals and the net impact it can have going forward. The chapter contains a table that you can use to determine how you see others and the cost of your view.Chapter 3 begins the discussion of Smart Trust, the alternative to blind trust and distrust. Smart Trust is judgment and boils down to how to trust in a low trust world. The two key factors for Smart Trust are a propensity to trust and analysis. The propensity to trust is about leading out with trust. Analysis is about not getting burned in a low trust world. The analysis involves 3 components: Opportunity, Risk and Credibility. The authors use these components to launch into a discussion of the Smart Trust Matrix citing a number of examples. The chapter ends with examples of the reciprocity of trust.The next several chapters deal with the five Smart Trust Actions:•	Choose to Believe in Trust: The authors delve into the three beliefs of trust:1.	A belief in being worthy of trust.2.	A belief that most people can be trusted.3.	A belief that extending trust is a better way to lead.•	Start with Self: Based on the principles of responsibility and creditability.•	Declare Your Intent and Assume Positive Intent in Others: Stating what we want to do and why we want to do it. •	Do What You Say You Are Going To Do•	Lead Out in Extending Trust to Others: It produces results, it increases trust and it elicits reciprocity. The authors end with a chapter on how one person can make a change.My recommendation is that while this book can stand on its own, the reader will get more out of it by reading the author’s prior book “The Speed of Trust” first.

Smart Trust: Creating Prosperity, Energy, and Joy in a Low-Trust World by Stephen M.R. Covey, Greg Link & Rebecca R. Merrill was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2012.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:There are times when the launch of a book coincides with current events in a way that makes it a touchstone for navigating a new era in business. The first decade of the new millennium saw the emergence of transparency as both a frequently used buzzword and, more importantly, a guiding principle for organizations enduring increased scrutiny from customers. Stephen M.R. Covey’s 2006 release The Speed of Trust became the go-to resource for executives that wanted a clear, executable strategy to increase trust and remove time-wasting roadblocks. Now available is Covey’s follow-up volume Smart Trust: Creating Prosperity, Energy and Joy in a Low-Trust World, co-authored by Greg Link with Rebecca R. Merrill.Smart Trust is the result of the most frequently asked question Covey received while teaching others the principles from The Speed of Trust: how can someone balance the two extremes of blind trust and total distrust? Anyone who has ever heard Covey speak knows his abilities as a storyteller. There is no loss of fidelity when the stories are translated to the page. Covey profiles notable companies who are successfully applying the principles of smart trust.Those principles are defined by five actions. Readers may find each of the five actions somewhat simplistic. However, the difference comes in applying them on both a team and organizational level. Consider the third smart trust action: Declare Your Intent and Assume Positive Intent in Others. Executives may readily vouch for their own ability to keep an open mind when dealing with clients or co-workers, but what if you have a team that’s experienced trust issues in the past? Suddenly, the advice Covey dispenses goes from intuitive to essential. This is true of the book as a whole, and a quick scan of the headlines proves that Smart Trust will join The Speed of Trust as a must-read for this era and beyond.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of Smart Trust is available here.

It is probably not fair to compare this book to the one that preceded it, but I just cannot give this one four stars when The Speed of Trust was such a life-changing revelation. I wanted the same lift, the same sense of epiphany, and am therefore disappointed. I was glad for an opportunity to spend more time thinking about the all-important subject of building and maintaining trusting relationships, and in fairness there was some solid new stuff in here. I have even used some of the new material to help a client group I have been working with. But what might have been an excellent journal article was stretched out to 258 pages and that makes for some dull reading.I can appreciate the challenge Rebecca Merrill (the actual writer) had, crafting a book out of very little material. In fact, I think the book gains from her regular repetition of the phrase "prosperity, energy, and joy" because it is an ever-present reminder of why we should work so hard to earn and extend trust. She does well with that. It's all the examples and stories that don't really contribute much that I struggled to slog through. I don't say this very often, but in this case I will: I recommend reading The Speed of Trust itself but the two-page summary of Smart Trust I will soon post to www.whatiscathyreading.com is all you'll need to get the full value of this one.One important take away for me comes in the form of another Covey matrix with four quadrants. It is helpful to understand how lower or higher levels of a propensity to trust combine with more or less analysis of a specific person or situation to produce no trust, blind trust, distrust, or Smart Trust. We learned in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (by Stephen M. R. Covey's father) that a whole lot of the sweet life is found in Quadrant 2 and so it is with Smart Trust as well. I want to think about every situation and I want to extend trust where and when I can. If I am successful with that then prosperity, energy, and joy are sure to follow.

I finished my reading of “Smart Trust.” When I first read “Speed of Trust” in 2006 I was profoundly impacted by the structure that was added to a relatively elusive topic. I keep a small paper with the thirteen behaviors of a High Trust Leader on my desk and refer to it often. “Smart Trust” seems like the natural follow up to all the HOW questions that were generated by “Speed of Trust.”The five Smart Trust actions that this book teaches make a clear outline of how to generate trust in a team, family, or other organization. Simple, but not to a fault, these five actions make it easy to understand. They are, Choose to Believe in Trust, Start with Self, Declare Your Intent, Do What You Say, and Lead Out in Extending Trust. While they sound straight forward on the surface, the book explores valuable examples and insights that help create a framework of putting it all together in a clear action plan.The order of the five actions is not an accident. I suspect that I will need to go back to the book often to continue my journey in implementing trust in the various arenas of life as I move through the action steps.The biggest take away from this book is a continuation of the first. Simply put, trust changes everything. It plays the biggest part in the bottom line and success of any relationship or organization. Creating a vocabulary around the principle allows us to discuss it among ourselves in terms that we all understand. These authors have done that and I believe that this is part of the revolution of restoring trust in our families, relationships, work places, communities, and countries.

AFTER MY OWN FAILURES (shuttering my national magazine at age 26) and my many personal ones: breakups, bankruptcy, divorce — and back again — I relate first-hand to the high costs (emotional and financial) of a breakdown of trust. But we forget that for people in the trenches facing massive failure, they face perhaps an even more debilitating blow. With the realization of our worst fears about the future and our place in it, then depression swept in and left me feeling defeated, tiny...  impotent! How does one recover from such devastating blows? When trust has been broken, can you really ever learn to trust again? Author and motivational entrepreneur, the late Stephen Covey, thought so. (Covey, you might remember, authored "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” I find it pretty fascinating that he chose in his final work, to focus entirely on TRUST. He considered this his legacy work Even worse than feeling burned, he argues, is going through life and/or business with low (or no) trust. While released a few years ago, the book stands the initial test of time, because the truths unearthed are perennial. I found the information on self trust the most important of the entire book. "Self trust" he writes, "is like the tide, it moves all of the boats." What a beautiful metaphor. The book is a must read for anyone who has been through the fire of broken agreements. Bottom Line: There is everything to be gained from learning to trust again, but trusting smart.

Covey's sequel to The Speed of Trust rehashes the concepts from the first book and pads a lot of pages with fluff. His core concepts are: Choose to believe in trust, Start with self, Declare your intent, Do what you say, and Lead out in extending trust. All of these were covered in Speed of Trust.

A few good quotes and stories only. Amazed to find out many CEO's and business leaders lived by such enlightened principles. TRUST begins at the top of organizations, companies, families, and in relationships with individuals. At a time When TRUST and confidence in people, leaders, government, business, is at a very low point this book does an excellent job describing the problem, I was not that personally that impressed with the simple solutions that the authors presented.

Smart Trust is very easy to read and is of great value to all leaders interested in leveraging smart trust to distinguish their businesses.Strategy and technology no longer provide sustainable advantage to a business. Smart Trust is the foundation for all employees in a business organization that enables risk-taking which leads to innovation which results in progress.

This was required reading at work. Not a page turner, but worth the read. Changed my perspective on the value of trust in an organization, on a micro/personal level as well as a macro/organizational level. You get more done if you default to trust, it makes for a better work environment, and ultimately a better product/service.

 Fantastic book! It's a must-read for anyone who considers themselves a leader, or at least wants to be. I'd recommend reading "The Speed of Trust" first though, which is also excellent. I've seen high trust cultures in action in the workplace, family and relationships and it's amazing how brilliant people can be...when they're trusted to be.

Good book, Stephen takes the Speed of Trust to a little more deeper in the Smart Trust book. It spends a lot of time reviewing why trust is important, since I read the Speed of Trust, this wasn't as valuable to me, but the five actions of smart trust was pretty good. Especially because it reinforced some of my current behaviors and gave me a good idea about changing some others.

On the spectrum of blind trust to no trust, use the risk involved as the fulcrum, balance with expertise and experience. Lead with trust of others and never do anything that will damage your reputation. It was a short, quick read that probably should have been a chapter rather than a book.

There was a lot of overlap and repeat in this book from "The Speed of Trust". The ideas are still good but I preferred the other. I didn't feel that there was anything relevant added - just more stories.

Stephen M. R. Covey is co-founder and CEO of CoveyLink Worldwide. A sought-after and compelling keynote speaker and advisor on trust, leadership, ethics, and high performance, he speaks to audiences around the world. He is the author of The SPEED of Trust, a groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting book that challenges our age-old assumption that trust is merely a soft, social virtue and instead demonstrates that trust is a hard-edged, economic driver—a learnable and measurable skill that makes organizations more profitable, people more promotable, and relationships more energizing. He advocates that nothing is as fast as the speed of trust and that the ability to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust with all stakeholders is the critical leadership competency of the new global economy. Covey passionately delivers that message and is dedicated to enabling individuals and organizations to reap the dividends of high trust. Audiences and organizations alike resonate with his informed, practical approach to real-time issues that affect their immediate and long-term performance.He is the former CEO of Covey Leadership Center, which, under his stewardship, became the largest leadership development company in the world. Covey personally led the strategy that propelled his father’s book, Dr. Stephen R. Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, to one of the two most influential business books of the 20th Century, according to CEO Magazine. A Harvard MBA, he joined Covey Leadership Center as a Client Developer and later became National Sales Manager and then President & CEO. Under Covey’s direction, the company grew rapidly and profitably, achieving Inc. 500 status. As President & CEO, he nearly doubled revenues to over $110 million while increasing profits by 12 times. During that period, both customer and employee trust reached new highs and the company expanded throughout the world into over 40 countries. This greatly increased the value of the brand and company. The company was valued at only $2.4 million when Covey was named CEO, and, within three years, he grew shareholder value to $160 million in a merger he orchestrated with then Franklin Quest to form FranklinCovey.Over the years, Covey has gained considerable respect and influence with executives and leaders of Fortune 500 companies as well as with mid- and small-sized private sector and public sector organizations he’s consulted. Clients recognize his unique perspective on real-world organizational issues based on his practical experience as a former CEO.Covey currently serves on the board/advisory board of several entities, including the Human Performance Institute—the leader in energy management technology—where he serves as Advisory Board Chairman.Covey resides with his wife and children in the shadows of the Rocky Mountains.

FAQ

What are UITs?Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are a fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. These types of portfolios allow investors to know what securities are held within a UIT as of the date of deposit, as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust. While it is not common, a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus. UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum, typically liquid investment. As a point of contrast, while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities, thereby changing their investment mix, the securities held in a UIT generally remain fixed.
How are UIT securities chosen?Some UIT securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index. Other UITs are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers, who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics, according to specific objectives. Once securities are selected, the UIT portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust.
Can a security held in a UIT be removed at any time?While it is rare, a security held in a UIT may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances, such as a significant decline in credit rating. By and large, securities held in a UIT remain fixed for the life of the trust, regardless of market value.
What are the minimum investments in SmartTrust® UITs?Typical minimums are 100 units, however, the minimums may vary based on the UIT. Higher minimums may also be required by each respective brokerage firm.
Are UITs suitable for my retirement accounts?Unit trusts may be an appropriate investment vehicle for IRAs or self-employed retirement plans. They offer a variety of investment opportunities — ranging from relatively conservative to more aggressive investments — in both domestic and international markets.
What are my options when a UIT matures?Option #1: Rollover at a reduced sales charge
At a reduced sales charge, investors may roll over into a new series of the same trust, if available, or any other SmartTrust® UIT available in the primary market*
*Maturity rollover is considered a taxable event. Please refer to each trust’s prospectus for complete rollover option information. Investors should be aware that there is a time limit to notify the trustee of the rollover.
Option #2: Maturity
Investors may do nothing and allow the portfolio units to mature. The trust will liquidate and they will receive a cash distribution of the trust’s proceeds, if any.
Option #3: In-kind distribution
Investors may generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units if they own 2,500 or more units at either the time of purchase or maturity. Please see additional provisions set forth in the prospectus. SmartTrust® Unit Investment Trusts are generally long-term investment strategies and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available. Investors should consult their tax advisor to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next, if available. Neither Hennion & Walsh, Inc. or Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, Inc. provide tax advice. Please refer to the trust prospectus for more complete in-kind distribution information. In-kind distribution is generally available for stocks traded and held in the United States. In-kind distribution may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Can I sell my units?You may sell all, or a portion of, your units any day the stock market is open. You will receive the then-current net asset value of the units, based on the current market value of the underlying securities in the portfolio, less any remaining deferred sales charge, as of the evaluation time. As the market fluctuates, of course, so will the value of your units. Therefore, your units may be worth more or less than what you originally paid.
How are UITs priced?UITs are priced at the end of each business day similar to mutual funds. The price is based on the market value of the underlying securities and includes cash and other assets and liabilities held by the trust.
Are UITs eligible in commission and fee/wrap accounts?UITs are available in a sales charge structure for commission accounts as well as for fee/wrap accounts. It is best to check with your individual brokerage firm to see if UITs are eligible for your fee/wrap platform.
Are UITs regulated?Unit investment trusts are one of three basic types of investment company. Investment companies are subject to stringent federal laws and oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is important to note that the SEC does not approve or disapprove of UITs or the securities within a given UIT or pass upon the adequacy of any prospectus for a given UIT. Investment companies are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This federal statute is highly detailed and governs the structure and day-to-day operations of investment companies. Investment companies are also subject to regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, FINRA, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

Discover the five trust actions that will help individuals minimize risk while maximizing possibilities.

















THE CHALLENGE
We live in a low-trust world surrounded by crises and challenges. Who can you trust? How can you trust? 

Choosing Smart Trust will enable you to operate with high-trust in a low-trust and unpredictable marketplace. The more unpredictable it becomes, the more your sound judgment and ability to trust in this low-trust world will give you a tremendous competitive advantage—and the capacity to navigate the uncertainty low trust creates.
 
Based on the book, Smart Trust, by Stephen M. R. Covey and Greg Link, this LiveClicks on-demand workshop will help you understand how trust issues impact every situation in life. In fact, trusted people are more likely to get hired or promoted, get the best projects and bigger budgets, and are last to be laid off. In Smart Trust, you will learn the five trust actions that will help you minimize risk while maximizing possibilities. This course will teach you the tools you need to extend Smart Trust, which will help you enjoy greater prosperity, energy, and joy—both personally and professionally.

								“The first job of a leader—at work or at home—is to inspire trust. It’s to bring out the best in people by entrusting them with meaningful stewardships, and to create an environment in which high-trust interaction inspires creativity and possibility.” 
-Stephen M. R. Covey
