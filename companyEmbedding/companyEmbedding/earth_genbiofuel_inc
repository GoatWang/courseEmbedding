About us - Energy Factor



















































        About us
      


Welcome to Energy Factor, an online resource covering the cutting-edge technology and innovations that are helping to meet tomorrow’s energy needs.
Sponsored by ExxonMobil, Energy Factor uncovers the untold stories that ultimately matter to all of us as we develop safe and reliable energy sources for the future. We highlight the communities and visionaries we collaborate with both in the U.S. and abroad to bring you informed, entertaining, and unexpected content.
We invite you to explore wide-ranging topics from the development of low-emission diesel fuel from algae, to the dramatic challenges of producing energy in some of the world’s most inhospitable places.
As we forge new paths in technology and science, Energy Factor gives you the opportunity to peer into tomorrow along with us through this bold multimedia publication.
Energy lives here.

Earth Gen-BioFuel Inc. Sees World Castor Bean Demand Exceeding Its Expectations
CITY OF INDUSTRY, CA--(Marketwired - May 5, 2016) -  Earth Gen-BioFuel (OTC PINK: EGBB), "EarthGen" or "the Company," today announced that based on it is 2016 international planning tour, that it expects that world wide demand for Castor Beans to exceed demand for the next 10 years.
George Shen, Chairman, stated, "The ever-expanding end uses of castor oil and its derivatives make it imperative that world Castor Bean production be increased. During our operational planning for 2016 and 2017, I have toured our area of operations in Laos and received reports from our agricultural advisors in Singapore, China, and South America. We have confirmed reports that the demand for Castor Beans and Castor Bean derivative products exceeds current production by a wide margin. These facts and EarthGen's goal of becoming one of the largest US based growers of Castor Beans is the basis for the Company's expansion goals."
Our operating plans call for starting Castor Bean operations in South America and in the US. Plans also include adding 4,000 acres of Castor Bean farms in Laos over the next two years. It is estimated that 4,000 acres of new farms are capable of producing 8,500 tons of castor beans annually that could produce annual sales of approximately $4,500,000 based on today's world market prices. The planting schedules are subject to finalizing land use rights in these areas and obtaining additional working capital.
In the recent April 2016 report published by Castor Oil Reports, they noted that Castor oil is possibly the plant oil industry's most underappreciated asset. It was also reported that Castor Beans are one of the most versatile of plant oils. It is used in over ten diverse industries and is the starting material for producing of over 700 end products. New applications of castor oil are being explored in areas such as pharmaceuticals and biopolymers / bioplastics. The reported concludes that these end user markets for castor oil and its derivatives are expected to expand significantly over the next few years. 
Castor Oil Report also points out that uses of castor oil have changed over the years. Many years ago, castor oil was primarily used for medicinal purposes and as a general industrial lubricant. Today, chemical engineers have come up with many uses of castor oil and its derivatives such as: Polyamide 11 (Nylon 11 fibers are use in the very large carpet manufacturing industry) engineering plastics for heat tolerant automotive and air plane parts, lubricating grease, coatings, inks, sealant, aircraft lubricants, surfactants, emulsifiers, encapsulants, plastic films, plasticizer for coatings, and components for shatterproof safety glass. Castor oil has even made its way into cosmetics and related products.
Even as more uses for castor oil emerge, EarthGen believes that demand for castor oil will be most affected by its use as "clean fuel" biodiesel. One example of this is cited in studies done by Evogene Ltd., an Israeli based agricultural hybrid seed-company. The report of tests in Brazil for biodiesel and biojet fuel production utilizing Castor Beans found castor beans to be an effective drought tolerant and high oil yielding crop.
Expanding use of Castor Bean Oil and the results of Evogene's tests, confirm that Castor Beans are an ideal "Clean Biodiesel" feedstock and are some of the reasons why Earth Gen is accelerating plans for Castor Bean farming in California by utilizing non-farm land to cultivate a high value drought tolerant Castor Bean crop. 
US demand for castor bean oil is reported to exceed supply by approximately 100,000 tons or about $120 million. Castor Bean oil demand in the European Economic Community is reported to exceed demand by 500,000 tons or about $500 million. China demand is reported to exceed supply by 1,200,000 tons or about $1.3 billion. Brazil (a leader in bio-fuel utilization) reported castor bean oil demand of 300,000 tons more than supply or about $300 million. It is the same in other regions of the world such as Japan, Thailand, and India where Castor Bean oil demand is reported to exceed supply by over 1,000,000 tons.
These demand figures are for using Castor Bean oil for manufacturing and not the expected future demand for use as "clean biodiesel." EarthGen believes that based on import demands from the major industrial countries and the need of chemical manufacturing for Castor Bean oil as a feedstock, that the market demand for Castor Beans already greatly exceeds current production.
About EarthGen-BioFuel
Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc., a U.S. based international agribusiness company is cultivating Castor Bean farms in Southeast Asia. Castor Beans are a renewable resource as a non-food agricultural product used in manufacturing clean transportation fuel, and utilized in over 700 manufacturing processes. EarthGen's goal is to become one of the world's largest growers of Castor Beans. Our first operation includes 600-acres of Castor Bean farms in Laos, with a full-scale harvest scheduled for year-end 2016. The Company plans to expand Southeast Asia operations to 4,000 acres over the next two-years, which is expected to make Earth Gen one the largest operators in the area. Worldwide demand continues to grow, due to high demand for manufactured products using Castor Bean oil and the crops value as a renewable "energy crop."

Castor Seed Oil Industry

THE CASTOR SEED OIL INDUSTRY 
As the availability of castor oil increases, that the utilization of castor bean oil in manufacturing processes and clean transportation fuels will also increase driven by its use as clean transportation fuel.
Clean Biodiesel in the U.S. must be at least 20% vegetable oil and 80% petroleum diesel. Castor beans are now considered to be one of the most promising non-edible oil crops due to its high yield potential and its tolerance in diverse environmental conditions. Castor beans grow well   on marginal lands, which are usually unsuitable for food crops. The establishment of “Bioenergy” crops in marginal or degraded lands offers environmental benefits, such as protection from soil erosion and soil nutrient leaching, and improvement of soil properties.
In addition to a growing demand for Clean Biodiesel, Castor Beans are already in high demand as a key ingredient in the manufacture of over 700 commercial products including nylon, fiber optics, plastics, paints, tires, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, and it is used as an additive in approximately 3,000 commercial manufacturing processes. At this time, almost all castor seed oil derived from current bean production is being used in processing commercial products.

Opportunity

World demand for castor beans greatly exceeds current supplies by at least $2 Billion.  Management believes as more castor beans are grown, that even more demand will surface. Earth Gen is taking advantage of a scientific approach to the cultivation of Castor Bean and is expecting a very high level of production for each acre. It is anticipated that this will allow Earth Gen to be a low cost highly productive and competitively priced producer. As the harvest from the first 600 acres are ready for delivery the company has chosen to start delivering to a local castor bean processing facility in Bangkok, Thailand that has a demand for 40,000 tons ($24,000,000) per year. Based on obtaining additional working capital Earth Gen expansion plans for 2016 and 2017 has the potential to bring Earth Gen’s production to approximately 15,000 tons worth about $7,500,000 . With this added production shipments will also be made to China and other larger buyers of Castor Beans.

Renewable Energy

Renewable Energy for Transportation
Almost 75% of all U.S. consumption of diesel fuel is for transportation. Farms equipment, construction equipment and heating oil use the balance of 25%.   Soybean oil and canola oil provide almost all of the vegetable oil presently used in the U.S. to blend with diesel fuel to create a blended “Bio-Diesel” fuel, which government regulation defines as a “Clean Energy” product. The blended diesel oil must consist of at least 20% vegetable oil and 80% diesel oil and is called “B20” (Biodiesel).  Biodiesel may also be 5%, 10% or even 100% vegetable oil. The vegetable oil from the castor beans is not yet in large enough supply as all Castor Bean Oil is being used in manufacturing industrial and chemical products and is not being used to blend biodiesel fuel.
Over 2 Billion US Dollars of excess food grade soybean and canola oil go into the production of biodiesel. This compares with the total value of the world wide annual non-food Castor Bean crop, which is 2.2 Billion US Dollars.  Castor Bean oil also has properties that make it much more suitable for blending with diesel to create fuel without using food grade oil that could be used to lower the cost of vegetable oil worldwide.

About us


Earth Gen-Biofuel
Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. (Earth Gen”) is the largest US based international agribusiness company focused on cultivating Castor Beans a non-food agricultural product for manufacturing clean transportation fuel and for over 700 manufacturing processes. Earth Gen’s goal is to become one of the World’s largest growers of Castor Beans for use as a renewable resource for commercial products. Earth Gen’s farms use land not used for growing food crops.  Earth Gen has over 600 acres of farm operations. The first full-scale harvest of its crops is scheduled for 2016. The Company began operations in Southeast Asia and plans to expand operations to over 6,000 acres by the end of 2017 based on obtaining additional working capital. Earth Gen is also developing operations in Latin America starting in Peru and Mexico and plans to open facilities in the later part of 2016.
Earth Gen believes that castor beans are an agricultural crop already in short supply and in high demand for processing manufactured products in many countries. Moreover, castor bean cultivation has attracted attention as a “renewable energy crop” with high value due to its high oil content in comparison to other edible oil seed crops. Earth Gen’s business model is to meet this growing demand without competing against potentially more valuable crops by cultivating land for growing castor beans in areas of poor soil conditions where such cultivation does not replace the production of food crops and at the same time employ thousands of people with a major economic impact in Earth Gen’s areas of operation.

Earth Gen-Biofuel
Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. (Earth Gen”) is the largest US based international agribusiness company focused on cultivating Castor Beans a non-food agricultural product for manufacturing clean transportation fuel and for over 700 manufacturing processes. Earth Gen’s goal is to become one of the World’s largest growers of Castor Beans for use as a renewable resource for commercial products. Earth Gen’s farms use land not used for growing food crops.  Earth Gen has over 600 acres of farm operations. The first full-scale harvest of its crops is scheduled for 2016. The Company began operations in Southeast Asia and plans to expand operations to over 6,000 acres by the end of 2017 based on obtaining additional working capital. Earth Gen is also developing operations in Latin America starting in Peru and Mexico and plans to open facilities in the later part of 2016.
Earth Gen believes that castor beans are an agricultural crop already in short supply and in high demand for processing manufactured products in many countries. Moreover, castor bean cultivation has attracted attention as a “renewable energy crop” with high value due to its high oil content in comparison to other edible oil seed crops. Earth Gen’s business model is to meet this growing demand without competing against potentially more valuable crops by cultivating land for growing castor beans in areas of poor soil conditions where such cultivation does not replace the production of food crops and at the same time employ thousands of people with a major economic impact in Earth Gen’s areas of operation.

Castor Bean Demand Continues to Grow Based on the Need for Clean Transportation FuelMarketwiredMay 11, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareCITY OF INDUSTRY, CA--(Marketwired - May 11, 2016) - Earth Gen-BioFuel (  OTC PINK :  EGBB ), "EarthGen" or "the Company," confirmed its long-term goal of supplying the growing demand for "Clean Biodiesel" from Castor Beans. It is now very clear that air pollution has become a major health issue for many nations. The cost of human lives as a result of the need for clean air is becoming a worldwide priority as reflected in many countries establishing new stricter regulation of pollution causing transportation emissions.George Shen, Chairman, stated, "EarthGen believes that demand for castor oil will be most affected by its use as 'clean fuel' biodiesel. Demand for non-hydrocarbon clean fuel is becoming a clear international priority. In addition to the ever-expanding uses of castor oil and its derivatives as a feedstock for over 700 manufacturing processes and over 3000 products, the need for clean fuel is growing even faster. EarthGen will continue to focus its resources on increasing production of Castor Beans to meet current demand for chemical production and for 'Clean Biodiesel.' Castor oil used as biodiesel is beginning to be recognized in the transportation energy field. In Europe and the United States, Biodiesel from food grade soy and rapeseed is used for annual production of nearly 520,000,000 gallons of biodiesel. We believe that Clean Biodiesel from Castor Oil will gain a large share of the seed oil based biofuel market as Castor Beans are well suited to replace these other food products for use as transportation fuel."The outlook for Castor Bean industry is very positive based on the growing demand as a feedstock for manufacturing, the need for clean fuel and good economics for growers and processors. The Brazilian Enterprise for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) reported that genetic improvements in Castor Beans have increased the oil content of the castor bean to 48 to 55 percent, while Soybeans, now used for the production of biodiesel in the US, produces just 17 percent oil. Just as important, Castor Beans are a non-food crop and is drought resistant. The cultivation of Castor Beans does not complete for land needed to grow much needed food supplies or for cooking oil.Demand for Castor Beans just for manufactured product already far exceeds supplies. Brazil (a leader in bio-fuel utilization) reported castor bean oil demand of 300,000 tons more than supply or about US$300 million. It is the same in other regions of the world such as Japan, Thailand, and India where Castor Bean oil demand is reported to exceed supply by over 1,000,000 tons. US demand for castor bean oil is reported to exceed supply by approximately 100,000 tons or about US$120 million. Castor Bean oil demand in the European Economic Community is reported to exceed demand by 500,000 tons or about US$500 million. China demand is reported to exceed supply by 1,200,000 tons or about US$1.3 billion.According to an exhaustive study by the medical journal Lancet, an estimated 3.2 million people died prematurely in 2010 because of the poisonous effects of outdoor air pollution. The report stated that two-thirds of those killed by air pollution lived in Asia. Outdoor air pollution has become India's fifth highest killer, with only tobacco, high blood pressure, indoor air pollution from poorly ventilated stoves, and diets that lacking in fruit and vegetables kill more people.Recent news stories about air pollution have focused on Mexico City where drivers are limited on how many days a week they are allowed to use their cars. China's major cities Shanghai and Beijing continue to report high levels of air pollution. The primary sources of pollutants include exhaust emission from Beijing's more than five million motor vehicles. However, the World Health Organization ranks Beijing as having the 76th worst air pollution with New Delhi ranked #1.Hindu and Business Line, an India domiciled global publication reported that on May 10, 2016, that New Delhi is joining other global cities with very high pollution to ban the use of high polluting vehicles for public transportation. India Government regulations were confirmed on May 10th by the India Supreme Court, who only tweaked the new Government Law that was a blanket ban on diesel fueled taxis. The Court amended the law to make it clear that the final objective is a gradual phase-out of diesel taxis. There are approximately 24,000 taxis operating in and around New Deli. The court ordered that registration of city taxis is permissive only if these vehicles run on cleaner fuels. It was also reported that, no new dirty diesel fuel city taxis will be permitted, and the court urged the government to frame suitable laws regarding taxi operations with a premium on environment.Read MoreEarthGen believes that based on import demands from the major industrial countries and the need of chemical manufacturing based on Castor Bean oil as a feedstock, that the market demand for Castor Beans already greatly exceeds current production. EarthGen's is poised to benefit from the world wide trend for replacing hydrocarbon fuels with less polluting alternatives.About EarthGen-BioFuelEarth Gen-Biofuel Inc., a U.S. based international agribusiness company is cultivating Castor Bean farms in Southeast Asia. Castor Beans are a renewable resource as a non-food agricultural product used in manufacturing clean transportation fuel, and utilized in over 700 manufacturing processes. EarthGen's goal is to become one of the world's largest growers of Castor Beans. Our first operation includes 600-acres of Castor Bean farms in Laos, with a full-scale harvest scheduled for year-end 2016. The Company plans to expand Southeast Asia operations to 4,000 acres over the next two-years, which is expected to make Earth Gen one the largest operators in the area. Worldwide demand continues to grow, due to high demand for manufactured products using Castor Bean oil and the crops value as a renewable "energy crop."Forward-Looking StatementThis press release may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which include among others, the inherent uncertainties associated with smaller reporting companies, including without limitation, other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.www.earthgenbiofuel.com info@earthgenbiofuel.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextElectric cars win?

(  OTCQB :  EGBB ) ("EarthGen" or "the Company") through its 100% owned subsidiary Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. has completed an agreement with the Phonehong Tree Farms in Laos to purchase the rights to the Agarwood production from a 27-acre plantation in the Laos People's Democratic Republic containing over 9,000 mature Agarwood trees.First-grade Agarwood is one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world, particularly in Asia, according to Molecules, a leading international, peer-reviewed open access journal of natural product chemistry. Molecules adds that Agarwood is a highly prized non-timber forest product, which can be used in fragrances, incense, medicines, aromatherapy and religious ceremonies. The essential oil is a highly demanded ingredient in deluxe perfumery for its warm, unique balsamic notes with sandalwood-ambergris tonalities. The value of Agarwood shipped out of Singapore alone each year has been estimated to exceed $1.2 billion. In addition to various wood products and incense, the oil obtained from the tree when distilled fetches high prices depending on the oil's purity. The current global market for Agarwood is estimated to be in the range of US$6 to 8 billion and is growing rapidly.Agarwood is marketed throughout the world. As an example, Amazon.com has a number of offerings, with Agarwood chips priced from $10.00 to $28.00 per ounce. Based on wide price variations it is difficult to place a value on the harvested value of 9,000-mature Agarwood trees. It is expected that the trees will start to be harvested in 2017 and harvest will continue over a 4 to 5-year period. The plantation is configured to allow for replanting to begin almost immediately, starting with the early monsoon rains in July of this year. It takes five to six years for a tree to become mature enough to start the conversion to Agarwood, which is estimated to take an additional two to three years. Earth-Eco's replanting process should yield consistent Agarwood product availability for years to come.CEO George Shen stated, "Agarwood from our Phonehong Tree Farms is a highly valued crop and offers EarthGen the opportunity to use the experience we have gained in managing agricultural projects in Laos to build additional sources of revenue. I have a long history of managing rare wood forestry operations based on sustainability and environmentally sound practices. Our Agarwood plantation operations share the same operating goals with EarthGen's Castor Bean operations as contributors to keeping our environment clean and green."EarthGen's purchase agreement with Phonehong Tree Farms includes that, at the time of closing, EarthGen will issue the owner of Phonehong Tree Farms 2,500,000 shares of Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. "restricted" common stock. Additionally, Phonehong Tree Farms will assign the rights to all Agarwood trees on the land and the future rights to all products grown on the land for a period of 40 years to EarthGen's subsidiary Earth-Eco Agriculture Inc. Further details of the agreement have not been disclosed.Mr. Shen added that, "EarthGen believes there are many opportunities to acquire additional Agarwood assets as local farmers currently lack options to bring their products to market, reducing their income and overall economic development in Laos. Planned commercialization of the Agarwood trees will expand opportunities for farmers by introducing modern marketing methods and commercial practices that add value. As these small farmers become successful businesses, they should create jobs and contribute significantly to economic prosperity. In its areas of operations, EarthGen always works with local leaders and government officials to create programs to benefit the area population with medical services, educational opportunities and other long term programs for support of the area."In addition to the agricultural staff that EarthGen has already built for its Castor Bean operations in Laos, we are recruiting forestry specialists to assist in maximizing the Agarwood yield per acre. EarthGen's Management has developed a unique plantation development, management, processing and marketing model. Our goal is to produce good quality resinous wood, by utilizing inter-cropping and the same scientific approach EarthGen utilizes in its Castor Bean operations.Read MoreAbout Earth Gen-Biofuel Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc., a U.S. based international agribusiness company is cultivating Castor Bean farms in Southeast Asia.
