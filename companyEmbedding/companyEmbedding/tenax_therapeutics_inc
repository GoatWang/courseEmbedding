Tenax Therapeutics Provides Regulatory Update on Levosimendan






July 28, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MORRISVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TENX), a specialty pharmaceutical 
      company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products 
      for the critical care market, today provides a regulatory update 
      following discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) and Health Canada regarding a regulatory path forward for 
      levosimendan.
    

      In May 2017, the Company participated in a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA 
      to discuss the possibility of submitting an NDA for levosimendan in two 
      indications: treatment of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass 
      grafting (CABG) to reduce the risk of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) 
      and treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) 
      for improvement in symptoms. After a review of further analyses, the FDA 
      has requested an additional clinical trial. Given the size and scope of 
      such a trial, the Company is reviewing clinical, regulatory and 
      financial options with regard to the levosimendan program in the U.S. 
      and Canada.
    

      The Company’s Board of Directors is continuing its review of strategic 
      alternatives with the assistance of their financial advisors at 
      Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. Strategic alternatives under review 
      include, but are not limited to a merger, a business combination, a 
      strategic investment into the Company, or a purchase, license or other 
      acquisition of assets. This process may not result in any transaction 
      and the Company does not intend to disclose additional details unless 
      and until it has entered into a specific transaction.
    

About Levosimendan


      Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that works through a unique triple 
      mechanism of action. It initially was developed for intravenous use in 
      hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. It was 
      discovered and developed by Orion Pharma, Orion Corporation of Espoo 
      Finland, and is currently approved in over 60 countries for this 
      indication and not available in the United States. Tenax Therapeutics 
      acquired the North American rights to develop and commercialize 
      levosimendan from Phyxius Pharma.

Company | Tenax Therapeutics



 




























Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing a portfolio of products for the critical care market.
Our business strategy includes 3 core elements: Search, Develop, and Commercialize




Search:


We intend to identify and acquire innovative proprietary pharmaceutical products that represent high value commercial opportunities for the North American market. We do not intend to conduct basic research ourselves. The relative efficiency of our “search” strategy enables us to focus the majority of our resources on developing and commercializing innovative products that other companies have discovered.



Develop:


We intend to develop pharmaceutical products that meet significant unmet needs of critical care patients in North America. Our significant clinical development and regulatory experience makes Tenax Therapeutics an ideal partner for companies who lack this expertise, but who want to capitalize on the significant market opportunity that exists in the US and Canada.



Commercialize:


We intend to commercialize the products that we in-license and develop. Our substantial experience in launching and growing critical care brands in the US makes us an ideal partner for companies who lack this expertise and capability.

Tenax Therapeutics Provides Regulatory Update On Levosimendan






Business Wire




Jul 28, 2017 5:00 PM EDT













 




























































  Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TENX), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products for the critical care market, today provides a regulatory update following discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada regarding a regulatory path forward for levosimendan.  In May 2017, the Company participated in a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss the possibility of submitting an NDA for levosimendan in two indications: treatment of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to reduce the risk of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) for improvement in symptoms. After a review of further analyses, the FDA has requested an additional clinical trial. Given the size and scope of such a trial, the Company is reviewing clinical, regulatory and financial options with regard to the levosimendan program in the U.S. and Canada.  The Company's Board of Directors is continuing its review of strategic alternatives with the assistance of their financial advisors at Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. Strategic alternatives under review include, but are not limited to a merger, a business combination, a strategic investment into the Company, or a purchase, license or other acquisition of assets. This process may not result in any transaction and the Company does not intend to disclose additional details unless and until it has entered into a specific transaction.  About Levosimendan  Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that works through a unique triple mechanism of action. It initially was developed for intravenous use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. It was discovered and developed by Orion Pharma, Orion Corporation of Espoo Finland, and is currently approved in over 60 countries for this indication and not available in the United States. Tenax Therapeutics acquired the North American rights to develop and commercialize levosimendan from Phyxius Pharma.

(TENX), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products for the critical care market, today provided an update related to its business strategy, the clinical development of its product candidates and its management team: The Company’s Board of Directors is conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value and has formed a strategic committee of three independent board members to supervise management in this review. In addition, the Company has engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., a subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE MKT: LTS), as its financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process; including, but not limited to a merger, a business combination, a strategic investment into the Company, or a purchase, license or other acquisition of assets. This process may not result in any transaction and the Company does not intend to disclose additional details unless and until it has entered into a specific transaction.  As reported earlier, the Company continues to believe levosimendan is an effective and safe inotrope to increase cardiac output in patients at risk for or with perioperative low cardiac output. Accordingly, the Company plans to continue pursuing a regulatory filing in Canada. The Company continues to evaluate the results of the LEVO-CTS clinical trial and feedback provided by the FDA in preparation for the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to occur in May, while simultaneously exploring additional strategic options and alternatives that might enhance stockholder value.  Effective April 3, 2017, John Kelley resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and from the Company’s board of directors, but has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company for a period of time following his resignation. The Company’s Board of Directors appointed Michael Jebsen, the Company’s current President and Chief Financial Officer, as Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately upon Mr. Kelley’s resignation. Mr. Jebsen previously served as Interim Chief Executive Officer for the Company from 2011 to 2013. Ronald Blanck, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Company, said: “We thank John for his contributions and wish him well for the future. This development does not change the focus or direction of the Company, which remains dedicated to enhancing shareholder value through the development and commercialization of products for the critical care market and we have complete confidence in Michael’s ability to lead the Company once again during this transitional stage of its development.”“I thank the Board of Directors for this opportunity and look forward to building upon the foundation established through our prior drug development experience to bolster the Company’s product pipeline and commercialization efforts,” said Michael Jebsen.About Tenax TherapeuticsTenax Therapeutics, Inc., is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products for the critical care market.

 Press Release dated July 28, 2017


 TENAX THERAPEUTICS, INC.  ExhibitEX-99.1 2 tenx_ex991.htm PRESS RELEASE DATED JULY 28,…To view the full exhibit click hereAbout Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TENX) Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products for the critical care market. The Company’s main product is levosimendan. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer developed for intravenous use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. Levosimendan represents therapeutic modalities for the treatment of Low Cardiac Output Syndrome (LCOS), septic shock and other critical care conditions. The therapeutic effects of levosimendan are mediated through increased cardiac contractility by calcium sensitization of troponin C, resulting in a positive inotropic effect, which is not associated with substantial increases in oxygen demand; opening of potassium channels in the vasculature smooth muscle, resulting in a vasodilatory effect on all vascular beds, and opening of mitochondrial potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, resulting in a cardioprotective effect.
