That's charting for charts' sake. (Charting for Charts' Sake is also the title of my forthcoming explosive expose of data journalism)

Agree. Pie charts never the clearest way of displaying data - e.g. here is the same data in two different charts  https://twitter.com/albertocairo/status/889864054243819520 …pic.twitter.com/lIBeRY7VhH

True, but it still won't be _clearer_ than the columns. If you need the labels then why not just have a table? Why have a chart at all?

That's charting for charts' sake. (Charting for Charts' Sake is also the title of my forthcoming explosive expose of data journalism)

TBF, David Mundell should be on that map in Dumfriesshire (but didn't geocode for some reason). Doesn't change that much.

Once the ERDF funding goes, I think the chances of this revolt are higher. Has masked Westminster neglect of the North.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
