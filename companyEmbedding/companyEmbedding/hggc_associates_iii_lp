Baker2 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - HGGC has agreed to take a majority stake in database software firm Idera, valuing the company at roughly $1.125 billion including debt, the private equity firm said in a statement. Software that maintains databases, part of the broader enterprise technology market, has become a favorite of private equity firms looking for steady revenue streams.  Boston-based TA Associates, which previously controlled Idera, will keep a significant minority stake in the company, the statement said. HGGC, TA Associates and company management will contribute equity of about $400 million to $450 million as part of the deal, while Jefferies will provide roughly $700 million in financing, according to sources familiar with the matter. HGGC, based in Palo Alto, California, was co-founded by former National Football League's San Francisco 49ers star Steve Young.  Young said in a statement that HGGC is excited to become an investor in Idera since it has executed an "aggressive acquisition strategy" and "strong organic growth." The investment includes a pending acquisition of an unnamed company that Idera has made in recent months.   Idera provides database software for businesses in a variety of industries from education to government and makes tools to help employees monitor and test databases. It competes with CA Inc (CA.O) and BMC Software, which is now private and owned by private equity firms Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital.  TA Associates acquired the Houston, Texas based company for an undisclosed sum in 2014. HGGC's previous investments include marketing technology firm Etouches, an automated marketing software company called Selligent and FPX, software that helps tech companies price their products. It closed an $1.84 billion fund last year, its third buyout fund to date.  William Blair advised Idera. HGGC was advised by Jefferies LLC and Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Reporting by Liana B.

 BackNewsDetailsDate May 31, 2017Source HGGCHGGC Leads $1.125 Billion Recapitalization of IDERANew Investment in Leading Database Management Technology and
Application Development Company to Fuel Continued GrowthPALO ALTO, CA — HGGC, a leading middle market private equity firm, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to recapitalize IDERA (or “the Company”), a leading provider of database lifecycle management solutions and application development tools. The $1.125 billion recapitalization, led by HGGC, is being done in partnership with TA Associates, which has owned IDERA since 2014, and IDERA management. Upon completion of the deal, HGGC will be the controlling investor in IDERA, with TA Associates and management retaining a significant ownership stake. The recapitalization includes funding for a pending add-on acquisition by IDERA that is signed and expected to close in the coming months.
Based in Houston, IDERA develops software that enables database professionals to design, monitor and manage data systems, and builds application development tools to help software engineers build, test, and deploy a wide range of applications faster and more efficiently. The Company’s customers span multiple industries, including Education, Energy, Financial, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Media, Retail and Technology. The University of Notre Dame, Chevron, Saint Francis Health Services, and Microsoft are among the more than 20,000 organizations who use IDERA products every day.
“We are excited about becoming an investor in IDERA, which has not only achieved strong organic growth for over a decade, but has also successfully executed an aggressive acquisition strategy,” said Steve Young, HGGC Co-Founder and Managing Director. “We’re confident that our resources and relationships will help IDERA CEO Randy Jacops and his team build on their impressive success and continue to grow market share. We couldn’t ask for a better investor partner than TA Associates in this effort.”
IDERA is distinguished by its high-velocity, low-friction sales process, and innovative operating and delivery model. This approach adds more than 5,000 new customers annually and has helped drive a quadrupling of revenue since 2013. In addition, over the past 10 years, the IDERA management team has acquired and seamlessly integrated more than 20 businesses while achieving excellent margins.
“We are very pleased to strike this new partnership with HGGC,” said Hythem El-Nazer, Managing Director of TA Associates. “Since investing in IDERA in September of 2014, TA Associates has been privileged to partner with Randy Jacops and his team, and we are proud of the growth and accomplishments of the business over this period. We look forward to continuing our partnership with management and working alongside HGGC as IDERA continues to execute on its organic growth and add-on acquisition strategies.”
The database management systems and developer tools markets combined represent a more than $50 billion market opportunity where solutions provided by large enterprise software companies are aging, expensive and inflexible.
“IDERA’s efficient and highly-flexible research and development model, as well as its culture of continuous change, enables the Company to pivot in response to customer demand and quickly bring new software products to market,” added Neil White, Managing Director of HGGC.
“HGGC’s ‘Advantaged Investing’ model creates strong alignment of interests among principals and made the firm a very attractive partner for us,” said Jacops. “We’ve enjoyed a tremendous partnership with TA Associates and are confident we will have a similarly collaborative relationship with the HGGC team. HGGC has an outstanding reputation and track record, and they are already bringing a new excitement about what we can achieve together.”
William Blair is serving as financial advisor to IDERA. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal counsel to HGGC. Jefferies LLC is serving as financial advisor to HGGC and, through its affiliates, has agreed to provide debt financing in connection with the transaction.
