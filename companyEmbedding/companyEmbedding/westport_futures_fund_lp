Westport Futures Fund L.P. Key Developments

Westport Futures Fund L.P. Engages Ernst & Young LLP as the Registered Public Accounting Firm Replacing Deloitte & Touche LLP
Mar 29 17
As previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 7, 2016, the Board of Directors of Ceres Managed Futures LLC, the general partner of Westport Futures Fund L.P., dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the registered public accounting firm for the company, effective as of the close of business on the day the company's audited financial statements for the 2016 fiscal year end, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K, were filed. On March 28, 2017, the company filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and therefore, Deloitte's term as the company's registered public accounting firm has ended. As previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner, on behalf of the company, approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as the independent registered public accounting firm for the company. On March 28, 2017, the company filed its Form 10-K and its engagement of EY became effective.

AGENCY AGREEMENT
WESTPORT JWH FUTURES FUND L.P.
(A NEW YORK LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)
UNITS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST



November 11, 2009


Citigroup
Global Markets Inc.
388 Greenwich Street
New York, New York 10013


Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney LLC,
on behalf of its Smith Barney Channel
2000 Westchester Avenue
Purchase, New York 10577


Re: Westport
JWH Futures Fund L.P.


Ladies and
Gentlemen:


     Westport JWH
Futures Fund L.P. (formerly known as Smith Barney Westport Futures
Fund L.P.) (the “Partnership”) is organized as a
limited partnership under the New York Revised Uniform Limited
Partnership Act, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the
“Partnership Act”) for the purpose of speculative
trading, either directly or indirectly, in commodity interests
including, but not limited to futures contracts, swaps, options,
spot, and forward contracts. Ceres Managed Futures LLC (formerly
known as Citigroup Managed Futures LLC), a Delaware limited
liability company (the “General Partner”), offered
units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership (the
“Units”) publicly from August 1, 1997 through
February 1, 1998 and has offered Units privately since
March 15, 2000.


     The General
Partner desires to raise additional capital for the Partnership by
the continued sale of Units to certain qualified investors pursuant
to Rule 506 of Regulation D (“Reg. D”) under
section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”). The General Partner, the
Partnership, the business of the Partnership and the Units are
described in a Private Placement Offering Memorandum and Disclosure
Document dated August 1, 2009, prepared by the General
Partner. As used in this Agreement, “Memorandum” refers
to that Private Placement Offering Memorandum and Disclosure
Document, including the appendices thereto, unless such memorandum
or appendices have been supplemented or amended, in which case the
term shall refer, from and after the time the supplement or
amendment is delivered to each of you, to the memorandum and
appendices as so amended and supplemented. The commodity trading
advisor to the Partnership is currently John W. Henry &
Company, Inc. The General Partner may engage a different commodity
trading advisor at any time on behalf of the
Partnership.

 



 


     The subscribers
for Units will be required to execute the Subscription Agreement, a
copy of which is attached as an appendix to the Memorandum, and to
tender or cause to be tendered for each Unit subscribed cash in the
amount of the net asset value per Unit on the date of purchase.
Subscribers for Units whose Subscription Agreements are accepted by
the General Partner will become limited partners of the Partnership
(the “Limited Partners”) upon the execution by the
General Partner as attorney-in-fact for each such subscriber of a
Limited Partnership Agreement, as may be amended and restated from
time to time, a copy of which is attached as an appendix to the
Memorandum (the “Partnership Agreement”), and at the
time such subscribers’ names are entered in the books and
records of the Partnership.


     Section 1.
Appointment of Agent .


     On the basis of
the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in it,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,
on behalf of its Smith Barney Channel, are hereby appointed
non-exclusive agents of the Partnership during the offering period
specified in this Section, for the purpose of finding subscribers
for the Units for the account and risk of the Partnership through a
private offering. The offering period will continue until the
General Partner terminates it (with reasonable advance notice) or
until up to 200,000 Units, or such additional duly authorized
amount, have been subscribed (the “Continuous
Offering”). Units or partial Units sold during the Continuous
Offering will be sold at net asset value per Unit as of the last
day of each month, provided that the General Partner may determine
to not accept any offers to purchase Units in a particular month.
Subject to the performance by the General Partner of all of its
obligations to be performed under this Agreement and to the
completeness and accuracy of all material representations and
warranties of the General Partner contained in this Agreement, you
each hereby accept such agency and agree on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement to use reasonable efforts
during the Continuous Offering to find subscribers for the Units
subject to market demand. Such offering of Units shall be subject
to prior approval in accordance with your internal policies. Each
of you agree that your agency under this Agreement, which is
coupled with an interest and, therefore, is not terminable by the
General Partner without your permission, will continue until the
termination of the Continuous Offering or until such time as all
Units sold by you have been redeemed, whichever is
later.





 


 


Section 2. Representations
and Warranties of the Partnership and the General Partner
.





     The Partnership
and the General Partner jointly and severally represent and warrant
to each of you, individually, for your benefit, and for the benefit
of the purchasers of the Units sold by you that:


     (a) They will
deliver to you such number of copies of the Memorandum as you may
reasonably request, regardless of whether the Units are offered
solely to “accredited investors” as defined in Rule

directly or indirectly affiliated with any of them has, either
directly or through an agent, participated in the organization or

terms.


     (i) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Subscription
Agreements and the Partnership Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the
Memorandum, do not conflict with and will not constitute a breach
of, or default under, the certificate of formation or limited
liability company agreement of the General Partner or any agreement
or instrument by which the General Partner is bound by any order,
rule or regulation applicable to it of any court or any
governmental body or administrative agency having jurisdiction over
it.

separate escrow account has been opened at Citibank, N.A. (the

account.

obtained an executed Purchaser Representative
Questionnaire.

     (c) You will
make offers to sell Units to, or solicit offers to subscribe for
Units from, persons in only those states or other jurisdictions

under the applicable securities or “blue sky” statutes
of such states or other jurisdictions. You will not offer or sell
Units

If an individual or company (''agent'') agrees to act upon behalf of another organization or person (''the principal''), then an agency agreement is typically used. This document gives the agent the authority to act in the principal's interests. It also covers the nature of the relationship between the two parties, including information on when the agency agreement is terminated and responsibilities of the agent, plus compensation for the action.

Additional information that may be present in the document can include territory the agent may represent, trademark information, insurance protection and indemnification. If the agent were to incur expenses while acting as an agent, the agreement typically includes how they should be handled and other terms. Other topics one may include in the document are terms concerning records, taxes, warranties and state of governing law.

An agency agreement is a document that clearly states and defines the relationship between the parties, and protects both of their interests. Without drawing up the agreement, the agent may not be aware of the scope of their abilities. It is often used in the medical field, such as between a drug representative and the medication manufacturer.
