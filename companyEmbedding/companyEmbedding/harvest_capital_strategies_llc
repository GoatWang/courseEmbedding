SEC Charges Harvest Capital Strategies LLC for Short Selling Violations in Advance Stock Offerings
Oct 14 15
Harvest Capital Strategies LLC agreed to pay disgorgement of $18,835, prejudgment interest of $619.28, and a penalty of $65,000 to SEC. Intended  to  preserve the  independent pricing  mechanisms of  the securities  markets and  prevent stock price manipulation, Rule 105 prohibits firms  from participating in public stock  offerings after selling short  those same stocks. Through  its Rule 105 Initiative,  which was first announced  in 2013 as an effort  to address violations of the rule in an  expedited and  streamlined way,  the Division  of Enforcement  has taken  action on  every Rule  105 violation  over a de minimis  amount that has come  to its attention--promoting a  message of zero tolerance for these offenses.

Story | Harvest Capital | Harvest Capital









































Your life story is ever-evolving
As it unfolds, the plot will change – people will come and go and time will march on. Our clients come to us with a variety of needs, questions, and challenges –transitioning ownership of a business, sustaining a comfortable lifestyle in retirement, and managing an inheritance to name just a few.

5 Next Steps
 


Wealth and investment management

Harvest Capital specializes in wealth and investment management services, business transition planning, and for those who have achieved significant wealth, we offer family office services. We are a privately-owned firm that believes in promoting family continuity, educating family members about financial matters, and managing the “business of the family,” while protecting and growing assets.
We help people attain life goals, as well as financial objectives – while maintaining a sustained, comfortable lifestyle for you and your loved ones.
We help you write  the next chapter in your life’s story.






You are the main character

Ten years ago, where you thought you'd be today may be a far cry from where you are, or you may be precisely on target. The point is, all narratives evolve in their own unique way. No two are the same.
Yours may comprise a large cast of characters – spouse, family and close friends, business partners – and include many plot twists and turns. You may be the leader of a family business, the beneficiary of an estate, or a corporate executive. We recognize that your history, your goals and dreams for the future, are unique and personal, and because we are independent, we are free to help write the story that truly reflects your goals.










As your story evolves, things change



Planning
Transitions
Enjoyment

Perhaps your grandparents founded a business and passed it to your parents, who later transitioned it to you.  You’ve grown the business and achieved success, and now you’re considering what’s next.  Our team of professionals has the expertise to help you confidently transition your business and turn the page to your next adventure.
Or maybe you’ve reached the point in life where your children have graduated and married. You delight in your grandchildren, and begin to imagine life in retirement. How will you share your hard-earned wealth with your family, and who will you trust to manage it to realize the life you envision?
Perhaps you’ve inherited wealth from a loved one, and you’re not sure what to do. Your dream is to live comfortably, travel and support in a meaningful way the causes that you are passionate about. We understand. We’re passionate, too – about helping our clients define and reach their goals, about our team and our families, and about our community.

Regardless of the catalyst that led you to us, we listen closely to understand how you define success and create a financial strategy to help you flourish financially as you continue life’s adventure.






Every family experiences milestones

Many are anticipated and joyous, some are not. Planning is essential, but discussing family matters can be daunting to even the most harmonious family because money and emotions go hand-in-hand. 
Harvest Capital helps you navigate the ‘human’ side of wealth management. Family relationships are at the core of financial goal-setting, and clients turn to us as trusted advisors to craft strategies around their common family values and goals.























You've "arrived"

And Harvest Capital can help you write the next chapter in your life story.
We offer conflict-free wealth management and family office services to discerning clients throughout the country, and help business owners transition their companies to the next generation or third parties.  But more than that, we invest in your family – we learn who you are, what your financial goals and life dreams are. Our relationship helps you prosper as your life story unfolds.








	                			Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.
	                			


—Benjamin Franklin

We invite you to explore our website to learn more about our team and our services, and we invite you to call us at 603-224-6994 to discuss your specific needs and questions. We look forward to speaking with you.

Our investment expertise is at the core of our conflict-free services.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
