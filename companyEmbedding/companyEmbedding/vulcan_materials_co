Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), is an American company based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is principally engaged in the production, distribution and sale of construction materials. Vulcan is the largest producer of construction materials, primarily gravel, crushed stone, and sand, and employs approximately 7,000 people at over 300 facilities. Vulcan serves 19 states, the District of Columbia and Mexico. Vulcan's innovative Crescent Market project led to construction of a large quarry and deep water seaport on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, just south of Cancun. This quarry supplies Tampa, New Orleans, Houston, and Brownsville, Texas, as well as other Gulf coast seaports, with crushed limestone via large 62,000 ton self discharging ships.
History[edit]
On June 7, 2005, Vulcan completed the sale of its chemicals business, known as Vulcan Chemicals, to Occidental Chemical Corporation. The sale of assets included Vulcan's chloralkali plants in Wichita, Kansas; Geismar, Louisiana; and Port Edwards, Wisconsin, as well as Vulcan Chemicals' joint venture located in Geismar, Louisiana. In 2005, Vulcan acquired 11 aggregates operations and five asphalt plants in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee.
On February 19, 2007, Vulcan announced that it would buy stone and cement producer Florida Rock Industries for $4.7 billion.[2] Vulcan completed the acquisition of Florida Rock on November 16, 2007.
In March 2007, Vulcan announced that it had been named to Fortune Magazine's list of Most Admired Companies for the sixth time. The company was ranked first in its industry sector, "Building Materials, Glass." Overall, Vulcan ranked among the top 10 companies in the Fortune 1000 for both long-term investment and social responsibility.
In January 2014, Vulcan Materials announced they would be selling their Florida Rock Industry plants and equipment to Cementos Argos, of Colombia. In March 2014, Vulcan was able to fully divest these properties to Cementos Argos.[3]

Home> Construction Materials> Products and Services> Construction Aggregates




Construction Aggregates Vulcan is North America’s leading producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel. We produce these materials from natural deposits such as granite, limestone and trap rock. Our quarrying process typically begins with drilling and blasting the rock into smaller pieces. Next, the material goes through various stages of crushing and screening to produce the sizes and specifications desired by our customers. Construction aggregates form the underpinnings of our cities, towns and transportation networks. Thousands of years ago, civilizations built entire cities with stone, sand and gravel, and many of these ancient structures exist today.







Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways.  As a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads. To aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control. As a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life. These include:
     Houses and apartments Roads, bridges and parking lots Schools and hospitals Commercial buildings and retail space Sewer systems Airports and runways   







To locate a construction aggregate facility in your area and speak to a sales representative, use our Facilities Map.

Home> Construction Materials




The nation’s leading producer of aggregates. Strategically located coast to coast. 16 billion tons in reserves. Vulcan provides a diverse line of aggregates and related products and services to all parts of the construction industry. In addition to construction aggregates, we are a leading provider of asphalt mix, ready-mixed concrete and paving materials. 








Historically, more than half of the aggregates we produce have been used in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure—highways and roads, and other public works projects. The remainder has been used in the construction of housing, nonresidential buildings, commercial and industrial facilities, as railroad ballast, and in non-construction uses including agricultural and various industrial applications.

Home> Construction Materials> Products and Services> Recycled Materials




Recycled Materials Where practical, we recycle previously used concrete and asphalt paving materials. After careful inspection, these materials are re-crushed and sized to meet customer specifications for other uses. At times, the incoming material contains steel wire or rods that were used to support or reinforce the original structure. If steel is found, it is removed, sorted and shipped back to steel producers to be reused. For large-scale projects in some markets, we can provide on-site recycling, avoiding the cost and time it takes to transport materials to a recycling facility.




To find out more about local recycling requirements and speak to a sales representative, use our Facilities Map.

Asphalt Paving Materials Vulcan is a leading producer of asphalt paving mixtures, consisting of construction aggregates, asphalt binder, additives and modifiers.







Asphalt was first used in this country just after the Civil War. Today, it is the paving surface for approximately 94% of our paved roads and highways. Asphalt also remains a popular surface for parking lots, driveways, walking trails and bike paths. Vulcan owns and operates asphalt production facilities primarily in major metropolitan areas of California and Texas. We also produce asphalt in Arizona and New Mexico. In markets where we do not sell asphalt, we work closely with local producers who do. The exact mix of ingredients is customized for each project based on a number of factors, including local weather patterns and expected traffic conditions. When expert assistance is required, our Technical Services personnel routinely work with customers and specifiers to optimize mix designs.







To locate an asphalt facility in your area and speak to a sales representative, use our Facilities Map.

Suppliers Suppliers play a key role in our continued success. Each year we spend well over $1 billion on goods and services to operate our businesses. Our strategy is simple:







 Identify and select world-class suppliers. Continually work with them to remove inefficiencies and lower costs. Provide continual feedback. Recognize excellence.  We expect a lot from our suppliers. In return, we see ourselves as offering stable demand, prompt payment, and the ability to work with many of the industry’s best people.

Sourcing Decisions

Open [+]






Sourcing decisions for goods and services commonly needed in large volumes such as diesel fuel and haul trucks, are often made by our Strategic Sourcing teams. These cross-functional teams of experts develop buying strategies and often establish companywide agreements with suppliers. Details of the agreements are recorded in our procurement system so buyers from across the organization can quickly and efficiently purchase what they need.
Sourcing decisions for goods and services not typically required in large volumes, or where local supply proximity is important, are made at the regional or plant level. In addition, once suppliers have been qualified and set up in our procurement system, all of the day-to-day buying takes place at the regional or plant level.






Frequently Asked Questions

Open [+]





How can my company be considered for future business with Vulcan? Depending on the good or service offered, Vulcan evaluates suppliers at the national, regional and local level. Goods and services commonly required in large volumes are often selected by Strategic Sourcing Teams. In many of these cases, we already have existing supply relationships, but we will periodically evaluate other suppliers, when appropriate. We have established many supply relationships, covering the majority the goods and services we need to operate our businesses. Sourcing decisions for goods and services not typically required in large volumes, or where local supply proximity is important, are made at the region or plant level. We have Procurement Leaders within each division who work with our Operations, Administrative and Engineering personnel to identify and maintain these supply relationships.  How quickly should I expect to be paid? Our goal is to pay our suppliers within terms. Many smaller purchases are paid up-front with a credit card or check. Also, we routinely pay early when attractive payment discounts are offered. What forms of electronic commerce does Vulcan utilize with suppliers? We have the ability to send purchase orders and receive invoices using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). We use a translator service and can convert most forms to EDI. Who do I call to track the status of a payment or a problem with an invoice? Call our vendor hotline at (800) 462-4813.






Recognizing Excellence

Open [+]





Each year, Vulcan solicits specific feedback regarding supplier performance from our plant managers. “Scorecards” are compiled and suppliers are ranked. The highest performing suppliers are recognized for their outstanding support to our operations with platinum and gold awards. The 2016 award recipients were (in alphabetical order):
