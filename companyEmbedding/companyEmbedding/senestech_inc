FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Dec. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- SenesTech, Inc. (NASDAQ:   SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, today announced the launch of ContraPest "research sales" as part of its "go to market" strategy for commercializing its lead product.








On August 2, 2016, SenesTech received registration from the U.S. EPA for its first product, ContraPest®. This registration, the first for a non-lethal fertility control product for managing rat populations, now allows for the marketing of ContraPest in the U.S., and is globally seen as the first new product with the potential to effectively address rat infestations. 
The Company has adopted a "research sales" policy with key potential customers to research the deployment and use of ContraPest in customer specific settings such as housing projects and subway stations, while generating revenue to the Company. Initial research sales are already underway in Washington and Louisiana, while potential customer projects are under discussion in New York City, New Jersey, Georgia, and California. SenesTech is also pursuing opportunities outside the U.S. in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.
"It is key that we work closely with the early adopters of our fertility control technology," said Dr. Loretta P. Mayer, Chair, CEO and co-founder of SenesTech. "We are changing the paradigm of pest control, reducing the use of poisons with a safer, more sustainable solution. We continue to learn how best to do this with these early adopters while adding this approach to their integrated pest management plans.  This strategy allows a scientific product learning cycle, as well as generating cash flow for further growth. We can also use this model to more rapidly respond to urgent global infestations, such as those rapidly emerging in Paris."
About SenesTech 
SenesTech has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approach. 
The Company's first fertility control product candidate, ContraPest®, will be marketed for use initially in controlling rat infestations. ContraPest's novel technology and approach targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes, inducing egg loss in female rodents and impairing sperm development in males. Using proprietary bait stations, ContraPest is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rodent communities. ContraPest is designed, formulated, and dispensed to be safe for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, in a biodegradable product. In contrast, the historical approach to managing rodent pest populations, rodenticides, carries a high risk of environmental contamination and the poisoning of non-target animals, pets and children.
The Company believes its non-lethal approach targeting reproduction is more humane, less harmful to the environment, and more effective in providing a sustainable solution to pest infestations than traditional lethal pest management methods. There is currently no other non-lethal fertility control product approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for the management of rodent populations. The Company believes ContraPest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in improved performance in rodent control over rodenticides, without the negative environmental effects of rodenticides.  For more information visit the SenesTech website at www.senestech.com.

SenesTech, Inc. Key Developments

SenesTech Inc. Collaborates with the Wildhorse Ranch Rescue
Jul 17 17
SenesTech Inc. announced that it is collaborating with the Wildhorse Ranch Rescue (WRR) in Gilbert, Arizona to provide safe and sustainable control of a rat infestation at their facilities. The project will utilize ContraPest, SenesTech's proprietary technology for managing rodent pest populations through fertility control, for which Wildhorse Ranch Rescue has agreed to a two-year purchase agreement.


SenesTech, Inc. Announces the Effective Application of ContraPest in Second Species of Rat
Jul 11 17
SenesTech, Inc. announced the effective application of ContraPest in a second species of rat; Rattus rattus, commonly known as the black rat or roof rat. The black rat is found primarily in trees and roof locations and rarely on the ground in areas where the brown rat dominates. Both are commonly controlled invasive pest species, with the black rat commonly found in forested tropical locations. The study was conducted on the island of Hawaii by the US Department of Agriculture, under the direction of Dr. Shane Siers, USDA/APHIS/WS National Wildlife Research Center Hawaii Field Station, Hilo, HI. Wild-captured black rats were exposed to ContraPest for 58 days, which included the first breeding round. Treated animals produced no pups (0) for the first two breeding rounds (107 days). During the third breeding round, 128 days from the start of treatment and 70 days after the end of treatment, 6 pups were born to treated females, and 24 born to controls. The duration of infertility seen in this experiment represents a significant portion of a wild rat's reproductive lifespan. These results are consistent with a previous study by the USDA published by Dr. Gary Witmer in March 2017 conducted on wild-caught brown rats, Rattus norvegicus.


SenesTech, Inc. Appoints Andrew Altman as Chief Operations Officer, Effective on June 19, 2017
Jun 2 17
On June 2, 2017, SenesTech, Inc. announced that Andrew Altman has been appointed as the company’s chief operations officer with primary responsibility for sales, marketing and manufacturing operations, an anticipated start date of June 19, 2017. Mr. Altman will also serve as an executive vice president of the company. Prior to joining company, from 2012 to 2017, Mr. Altman was vice president and general manager at Idexx BioResearch. From 2008 to 2012, he was vice president of Thermo Fischer Scientific, where he oversaw manufacturing, marketing and research and development. From 2005 to 2008, he was co-founder and president of IT Imaging.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Rodent Control: Challenges












Rodent control: an enormous global market in search of alternatives
Despite all efforts to control them, rodents are a persistent problem resulting in over $27 billion in annual losses in the United States alone. They cause infrastructure damage, crop loss, food contamination and disease. In SouthEast Asia, 1/3 of the rice crop is damaged by field rice rats. A mere 10% increase in rice production would feed an additional 380 million people.
Traditional methods are not sustainable
There has been no innovation or change in rodent control since the Middle Ages, and the world still has a growing rat problem. The primary products used to manage rodent populations are lethal rodenticides. Current methods are not sustainable and the search for alternatives has become more urgent.
Rat poisons may enter the ecosystem where they can become toxic to the environment, pets and wildlife if not used as directed. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, between 12-15,000 children are accidentally poisoned yearly in the U.S. alone. Killing rats does not result in a sustained population reduction. It often creates a rebound effect: surviving rats can reproduce even faster and neighboring rats can move in.
In recent years, the EPA has been placing increasing restrictions on lethal rodenticides, particularly anticoagulants. U.S. cities and municipalities have also begun to restrict their use.
A market worth $1.4 billion in the U.S. and $45 billion worldwide
Annual sales of rodenticides in the United States can be estimated to be $1.4 billion. In other nations, crop damage by rats impacts both human survival and that of various endangered species. Globally, over $40 billion is spent on rodent control. SenesTech expects to be in a position to capture a meaningful share of both the U.S. market (after we obtain EPA Registration) and the global market with our urban and agricultural products.

The future












The future of animal population management
We plan for our revolutionary technology to be applied in a variety of formulations and delivery methods to all species of mammals considered to be pests worldwide. Long term, it could become the humane and non-surgical answer to the population management of companion animals.
In addition to urban settings, our intention is to expand the worldwide use of our rodent bait products to increase crop yields in developing countries as well as the U.S. through rodent population management. Very key is the removal of poison from crop growing, food service and food manufacturing environments.
We also hope to apply our humane animal population control technology to stop the culling and killing of wildlife species. In various regions of the United States and the world, animals like deer, wild pigs, gophers, porcupines, feral cats and stray dogs are viewed as pests. Our species-specific formulations will be designed to provide a non-lethal solution to the excessive animal population growth.
Our work with dogs in the Tibetan refugee camps of Northern India indicates that our product may provide a potential solution to the growing incidence of rabies deaths in humans, in areas where surgical spaying/neutering and routine rabies vaccinations are impractical. It was a gratifying trip. Children brought us their pets for treatment and left with smiles on their faces.

Rodent Control: Our Product












Changing the paradigm by targeting the root cause: rat reproduction
SenesTech’s first product to be commercialized is a non-lethal compound designed to reduce rat populations by controlling reproduction.
We change the paradigm of rodent control by targeting the root cause of escalating populations: reproduction. The incredible speed at which rats reproduce and multiply is astounding. Two rat mating couples can, over an 8 to 12 month life span, generate 15 million descendants. While alive, they guard their territory from neighboring tribes who would invade if there were a sudden drop in population, the cause of poison’s “rebound effect.”
How it works
Our patented formulation causes both female and male rats to become infertile once they have consumed the effective dose. The active ingredient in females accelerates the rate at which ovarian follicles (egg structures) are depleted. Once these cells are gone, the animal cannot reproduce. In males, there is a marked reduction in the ability to fertilize eggs and, often, complete sterility. Otherwise, the animal lives out its normal 8 to 12 month life span without any observable side effects. It’s a truly humane approach that is also effective because it allows populations to taper off naturally without a “rebound.”
Orally self-administered and cost-effective
Our non-lethal compound is placed in a liquid bait that brings rats back for seconds, thirds and more. They happily help themselves until over a few weeks both the males and the females have made themselves infertile. Otherwise they continue to lead normal lives.
Rats need to consume at least 10% of their body weight in liquid every day, and our bait gives them an attractive source as they build up to the effective dose. Once ingested, our formula quickly becomes inactive. It is designed to be environmentally neutral when excreted. The SenesTech bait is specifically formulated for rats and does not affect other animal species or humans.
SenesTech is thus a sustainable and humane approach to pest control.

OUR REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY FOR ANIMAL PEST CONTROL TARGETS THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM: REPRODUCTION





Rodent management challenges





History
There’s been no innovation or change in rodent control since the Middle Ages, and the world still has a rat problem.





Ecology
Lethal rat poisons may enter the ecosystem where they can become toxic to the environment, pets and wildlife if not used as directed.





Safety
According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, between 12-15,000 children are accidentally poisoned yearly in the USA alone.





Sustainability
There’s no sustained reduction in population. Killing rats often creates a rebound effect: surviving rats can reproduce even faster and neighboring rats can move in.



 



Changing the paradigm: our technology gets at the root cause of the problem–reproduction.











Killing with poisons and traps isn’t just inhumane. It simply isn’t sustainable over the long run. Rodent populations just come back, often in greater numbers than before. Four pairs of breeding adult rats and their progeny can produce up to 15 million rats in one year. When rats ingest the SenesTech bait, both males and females lose the ability to reproduce. Instead of multiplying, they die of natural causes in 8 to 12 months. While alive they guard their territory from neighboring tribes who would invade if there were a sudden drop in population, the cause of poison’s “rebound effect”.






Our product is a sustainable, non-lethal solution to the rodent problem. Rats love it!






Rats readily consume our tasty bait, making themselves infertile.
Our non-lethal compound is placed in a liquid bait that brings rats back for seconds, thirds and more. They happily help themselves until over a few weeks both the males and the females become infertile. Otherwise they continue to lead normal lives without any observable side effects.
Rats need to consume generous amounts of liquid every day, and our bait gives them an attractive source. Once ingested, our formula quickly becomes inactive. It is designed to be environmentally neutral when excreted.
The SenesTech bait is specifically formulated for rats and does not affect other animal species or humans. It’s a sustainable and humane approach to pest control.


 


The SenesTech Mission
SenesTech aims to provide for the more humane treatment of animals, to improve the quality of human life, and to enhance environmental stewardship through global application of our animal fertility control technology. To that end, we are currently applying our revolutionary technology to the control of rats in urban and agricultural settings.


 


Curious how our technology works? SenesTech CEO Dr. Loretta Mayer makes it sound simple on Stephen Hawking’s “Brave New World” TV show. Watch video.











SenesTech is pleased to announce we have received EPA Registration as of August 2nd, 2016 for our first product ContraPest. For more information, please click here.






Our first real-world study: The New York Subway. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.






Fighting a losing battle with the rodents who infest the New York Subway, the New York MTA was looking for an innovative alternative. They had tried everything from lethal poisons to hunting sprees by citizen militias. Nothing worked. Then they found out about SenesTech’s transformative technology. Wasting no time, they partnered with SenesTech and the National Institute of Health in a first-of-its-kind pilot program to test our product in one of the world’s toughest environments. The results are more than promising.

Welcome						   	  	

Welcome 










We have developed and are seeking to commercialize globally a proprietary technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control. We believe our innovative non-lethal approach, targeting reproduction, is more humane, less harmful to the environment, and more effective in providing a sustainable solution to pest infestations than traditional lethal pest management methods. Our approach is designed to promote food security and reduce infrastructure damage, disease outbreaks, environmental contamination and other costs associated with rodent infestations. Our first fertility control product candidate, ContraPest, will be marketed for use in controlling rat populations. We are pursuing regulatory approvals for ContraPest in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., India, Argentina and the European Union (EU). We submitted ContraPest for registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, on August 23, 2015, and the EPA granted registration approval for ContraPest effective August 2, 2016. We believe ContraPest is the first fertility control product approved by the EPA for the management of rodent populations. However, before we can begin selling ContraPest in the U.S., we must obtain registration from the various state regulatory agencies. To date, we have received registration for ContraPest in 13 states, with additional applications pending. Other business initiatives include expanding our technology to other species and applications, and developing bio-synthetic sources of triptolide, an active ingredient in ContraPest that also has pharmaceutical applications. This initiative may produce a less expensive source of triptolide for our own use, and provide us with the potential opportunity to earn revenue from the sale of such product to our licensees and other potential consumers of triptolide.

(SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, announced today that in an effort to ensure that the Company can meet the rapidly increasing demand for their innovative new rodent control technology, ContraPest, it has launched its second manufacturing line in Flagstaff. With the addition of this second line, the Company's existing manufacturing capacity is expected to more than double.SenesTech, Inc. is a leader in technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control.More"We continue to learn and improve, and have incorporated that knowledge into this second line. We are confident that we will be able to handle the anticipated increase in demand," said Elissa Calloway, Vice President of Manufacturing at SenesTech.In order to utilize both manufacturing lines, SenesTech has added additional staff in both manufacturing and quality control."Delighting our customers is our primary focus. Our increased capacity insures timely and uninterrupted delivery of ContraPest," said Andrew Altman, Chief Operating Officer. About SenesTechSenesTech has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approach.The Company's first fertility control product, ContraPest®, is marketed for use in controlling rat infestations. ContraPest's novel technology and approach targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes, inducing egg loss in female rodents and impairing sperm development in males. Using proprietary bait stations, ContraPest is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rodent communities. ContraPest is designed, formulated and dispensed to be safe for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, in a biodegradable product. In contrast, the historical approach to managing rodent pest populations, rodenticides, carries a high risk of environmental contamination and the poisoning of non-target animals, pets and children.We believe our non-lethal approach, targeting reproduction, is more humane, less harmful to the environment, and more effective in providing a sustainable solution to pest infestations than traditional lethal pest management methods. There is currently no other non-lethal fertility control product approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for the management of rodent populations.  We believe ContraPest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in improved performance in rodent control over rodenticides, without the negative environmental effects of rodenticides.  For more information visit the SenesTech website at www.senestech.com.Safe Harbor StatementThis release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
