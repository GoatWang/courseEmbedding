Clough Global Dividend and Income Fund
Objective

    Searching globally for the most opportunistic investments in the capital markets, the Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return. The Clough Global Dividend and Income Fund seeks to pursue this objective by applying a fundamental research-driven investment process and will invest in equity and equity-related securities as well as fixed income securities, including both corporate and sovereign debt, in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets.
    
Portfolio Content

    The Fund intends to invest in a managed mix of equity and debt securities. The Fund is flexibly managed so that, depending on the Fund's investment adviser's outlook, it sometimes will be more heavily invested in equity securities or in debt or fixed income securities. Investments in non-U.S. markets will be made primarily through liquid securities, including depositary receipts (which evidence ownership in underlying foreign securities). Investments in corporate debt may include both investment grade and non-investment grade issues. Non-investment grade debt issues are commonly referred to as "high yield" or "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its total assets in securities rated, at the time of acquisition, below investment grade. Investments in sovereign debt may also include bonds issued by countries considered emerging markets. The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its total assets, at the time of acquisition, in securities of governments and companies in emerging markets.
