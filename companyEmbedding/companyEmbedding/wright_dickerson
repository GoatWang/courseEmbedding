The company is a horrible place to work. Management allows other employees to bully and harass others. They will force you to work for several people who you are not assigned to because they are not willing to pay enough workers to do the job satisfactorily. So they work one employee to death and if you complain and request assistance, they ignore your requests.ConsThe exact same as above.Advice to ManagementNeed new management across the board.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Dickinson Wright Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Dickinson Wright 2017-01-27 18:47 PST Join the Dickinson Wright team See Our Latest Jobs Nov 3, 2015 Helpful (1)"Great pay, but don't expect much else"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Associate Attorney in Detroit, MIFormer Employee - Associate Attorney in Detroit, MIDoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Dickinson Wright (Less than a year)ProsThe pay was excellent, the benefits were great, and I really appreciated the expectation that each associate would take their laptop home at the end of the day and continue to work from home or on the weekends, I felt less pressure to just be in the office even if I could accomplish the same task at home.ConsThe culture was cut-throat bordering on toxic, there was very little support, and there was a lot of blaming others to cover for yourself.Advice to ManagementThe computer training at the beginning of employment was largely review, and information never utilized or appreciated by supervising attorneys.
