Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.



 




“To be able to pay off my student loans before their original term date and save so much on the life of the loan is huge.”
Noel True, NYU MFA – $85,900 Refinanced, $38,400 saved

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Explanation Of Precision Pricing™ Savings






Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Your new loan will give you the flexibility to select a repayment term and repayment option that is right for you now.

        SunTrust Bank, Member FDIC. © 2017 SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        SunTrust and the Custom Choice Loan are federally registered service marks of SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        
        Certain restrictions and limitations may apply. SunTrust Bank reserves the right to change or discontinue these programs without notice. All loan programs are subject to approval and may not be available in certain jurisdictions.
SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and both federal and private student loans. Compare SunTrust private student loans.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

Be enrolled at least half-time or more in a degree seeking program at an approved, Title IV eligible school
Be a  U.S. citizen or permanent resident
Be the legal age of majority, or at least 17 years of age at the time of application if applying with a cosigner who meets the age of majority requirements in the cosigner's state of residence14

Do students need a cosigner?

A cosigner is not always required, but most students, especially those without a substantial credit history, may need a creditworthy cosigner to qualify
Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application

Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Custom Choice Loan
Call a SunTrust representative at 866-232-3889



Step one - Apply Online:

Students and cosigners, if applicable, apply online (they may apply at the same time or during separate sessions)
An Application and Solicitation Disclosure outlining current interest rate ranges, loan cost examples, federal student loan alternatives, and other general loan information is presented electronically to the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable

Step two - Consider the Option to Refinance Existing Private Student Loans into the New Loan:

The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option

Step three - Loan Options:

Upon passing the initial credit review16, loan options (including interest rates, repayment plans and repayment terms) are presented online

Step four - Loan Documentation:

Once loan options are selected, a list of required documentation is presented
Required documentation must be submitted before the loan process will continue
Documentation can be uploaded online or submitted by fax or mail

Step five - Loan Packet (Approval Disclosure, Credit Agreement, etc):

After all required documentation has been received and approved, a Loan Packet will be sent outlining the terms of the loan based on the preliminary loan amount before school certification and, for applicants opting to refinance existing student loans1, the payoff amounts provided by the student
The Loan Packet, including the Approval Disclosure, must be accepted within 30 calendar days if the student and, if applicable, the cosigner, agree to the loan terms
Acceptance of this can be given through the applicant's online account, by fax or by mail

Step six - School Certification:

Certification of the loan is required by the student's school of attendance and will be requested by SunTrust
The school will certify the loan ensuring that the student is enrolled at least half time, that the loan amount is correct, and will confirm disbursement specifications

Step seven - Final Disclosure:

After school certification is received, the final loan terms will be outlined in a Final Disclosure which will be mailed to both the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable; for convenience, the Final Disclosure is also available online
3 Day rescission period  the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable, will have three business days to cancel or rescind the loan
					
SunTrust must wait until this three business day period has expired before disbursement of funds can take place
No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.





SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans, prior to applying for a private student loan. Before selecting a private student loan, compare options offered by SunTrust.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.
4 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 
	current One-month LIBOR index (captured on the 25th day of each month, or the next 
	business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month and 
	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is 
	1.250% on 07/01/17.  LIBOR stands for 
	London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is the Current Index, as published 
	in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student's and cosigner's (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range.  The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR 
	index changes. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17. 
5 Current fixed interest rates depend on (1) the student's and cosigner's, if applicable, credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s). Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after 07/01/17.
6 Click here to see payment examples. Certain repayment terms are only available for loan amounts of $5,000 or more. Click here to find out more about available options.
7 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option. Partial Interest Repayment is available on loans of $5,000 or more.
8 Making interest only or partial interest payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance of the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see a payment example. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.
9 Typically the grace period is six months from (a) the date the student graduates, (b) the date the student drops below half-time status or (c) the date that is 60 months from the first disbursement date. The immediate repayment option does not have a grace period.
10 The minimum loan amount is $1,001 with exceptions based on the student's state of permanent residence, as follows: Alaska: $5,001, Colorado: $3,001, New Mexico: $2,501, Oklahoma: $5,001, Rhode Island: $5,001, South Carolina: $3,601. The Custom Choice Loan is available to applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; it is not available to international students or students/cosigners whose permanent residency state is Iowa or Wisconsin.
11 The maximum annual loan amount for the upcoming semester/academic period is determined by the school's cost of attendance, minus other financial aid such as federal student loans, scholarships or grants, up to $65,000.
12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.
14 The legal age for entering into contracts is 18 years of age in every state except Alabama (19 years old), Nebraska (19 years old, only for wards of the state), and Mississippi and Puerto Rico (21 years old).
	
15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.
16 The initial credit review is based on all the information you and your cosigner (if applicable) provide during the application process and the information obtained from your credit report (and any cosigner's credit report). If you pass the initial credit review, documentation will be requested to verify your identity and annual income and, if applicable, payoff documentation for any private student loan you request to refinance. A signed Loan Packet, including the Credit Agreement, Approval Disclosure and Applicant Self-Certification Form is required before a final loan decision is made. Your school will be required to certify the loan amount for the upcoming academic year/semester prior to disbursement.

Review Frequently Asked Questions about the Custom Choice Loan
Call a SunTrust representative at 866-232-3889



Step one - Apply Online:

Students and cosigners, if applicable, apply online (they may apply at the same time or during separate sessions)
An Application and Solicitation Disclosure outlining current interest rate ranges, loan cost examples, federal student loan alternatives, and other general loan information is presented electronically to the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable

Step two - Consider the Option to Refinance Existing Private Student Loans into the New Loan:

The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option

Step three - Loan Options:

Upon passing the initial credit review16, loan options (including interest rates, repayment plans and repayment terms) are presented online

Step four - Loan Documentation:

Once loan options are selected, a list of required documentation is presented
Required documentation must be submitted before the loan process will continue
Documentation can be uploaded online or submitted by fax or mail

Step five - Loan Packet (Approval Disclosure, Credit Agreement, etc):

After all required documentation has been received and approved, a Loan Packet will be sent outlining the terms of the loan based on the preliminary loan amount before school certification and, for applicants opting to refinance existing student loans1, the payoff amounts provided by the student
The Loan Packet, including the Approval Disclosure, must be accepted within 30 calendar days if the student and, if applicable, the cosigner, agree to the loan terms
Acceptance of this can be given through the applicant's online account, by fax or by mail

Step six - School Certification:

Certification of the loan is required by the student's school of attendance and will be requested by SunTrust
The school will certify the loan ensuring that the student is enrolled at least half time, that the loan amount is correct, and will confirm disbursement specifications

Step seven - Final Disclosure:

After school certification is received, the final loan terms will be outlined in a Final Disclosure which will be mailed to both the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable; for convenience, the Final Disclosure is also available online
3 Day rescission period  the student borrower and cosigner, if applicable, will have three business days to cancel or rescind the loan
					
SunTrust must wait until this three business day period has expired before disbursement of funds can take place
No action is required by the borrower and cosigner, if applicable, unless either desires to cancel or rescind the loan



Step eight - Loan Disbursement:

Funds for the upcoming semester/academic period

Amounts and timing of when a loan is disbursed is given to SunTrust by the school
A loan may have up to four disbursements and disbursement amounts do not have to be equal
Funds are sent to the school and applied to the student's account; any overage of funds above/beyond what is owed to the school is handled between the school and student


Payoffs for loans being refinanced

If a portion of the new loan is being used to refinance existing private student loans, payoffs are sent to the Servicer; more about this option
Payments should continue to be made on any loans being refinanced until they are paid off  time will elapse between when this option is requested and when the loans are actually paid off
If the payoff amount(s) sent by SunTrust do not cover the entire balance owed on the existing loan(s), the outstanding balance(s) will remain your responsibility





What is a cosigner?
A cosigner is an additional applicant besides the student, such as a parent, guardian, grandparent or other person, who will bear the same legal responsibility as the student.
Why is a cosigner important?
Many students don't have a substantial credit history or have other concerns about being approved for a private student loan, and adding a creditworthy cosigner may help them qualify and also obtain a lower interest rate.
What makes a good cosigner on a loan?

				A good cosigner:
					
Has a substantial credit history
Does not have any serious negative items on their credit report
Meets their credit obligations on time
Is not over burdened with debt
Has steady employment and/or income sufficient to meet debt obligations

Can a cosigner be released from the loan?
The cosigner can be released from liability after a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments (either 36 or 48 monthly payments, as set forth in your Credit Agreement) have been made on-time.13 The borrower must meet credit criteria on their own at that time. For more details, click here.
What if there is an unfortunate event, such as death or disability, of the student borrower?
In the event of the primary borrower's death or permanent disability, the loan will be forgiven. Proper documentation is required and the cosigner won't be responsible for repayment.15
How is a cosigner added to a Custom Choice loan?

				Applying as a cosigner takes about 15 minutes. Either the cosigner or the student can start the application  the EasyInviteSM tool, within the online application, allows the cosigner or the student to be invited to the application.

1 Private student loans that can be refinanced with a new SunTrust private student loan are private student loans and private consolidation loans that the student applicant used for, or to refinance loans used for, postsecondary Qualified Higher Education Expenses not currently in a past due status. Loans that cannot be refinanced into this loan are (1) private student loans for which the student applicant is not the primary borrower, (2) Federal student loans and (3) student loans made by an educational institution; learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.
2 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank 
	account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% 
	interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) 
	apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. 
	Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is 
	stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (2) there are three automatic deductions 
	returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust Bank account.  In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
3 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

	rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to the margin. The current One-month LIBOR index is

8 Making interest only or partial interest payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance of the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see a payment example. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties. For Immediate Repayment loans, repayment of principal and interest begins 30-60 days after the final disbursement. The minimum monthly payment is $50.00.

12 The aggregate maximum student loan debt allowed is $150,000 (includes all student loans and certain unsecured consumer debt).
13 A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the servicer provided that the student borrower is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien and has met credit criteria, and a specific number of consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been made on-time (received within 10 calendar days after the due date), as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Cosigner release may not be available for loans in a forbearance status.

15 If the student borrower on a loan dies after disbursement of all or part of the loan and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, then the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance on such loan shall be forgiven if the servicer is informed of the student borrower's death and receives acceptable proof of death. If the student borrower on a loan becomes totally and permanently disabled and the loan has not previously become a charged off loan due to non-payment or bankruptcy, the student borrower may apply to have the loan balance discharged by completing a discharge application.

SunTrust Private Student Loans




















Choosing the right private student loan is as important as choosing the right college





Apply online now. It's the smart way to get the money to cover your college essentials.

A few simple things to know before you apply.

Repayment Plans1
Take a moment to consider the best way for you to pay back your loan. There are up to four options to choose from:

Immediate Repayment
Interest-Only Repayment2
Partial Interest Repayment2
In-School Deferment2

Interest Rate Options
Choose between a fixed or variable rate:

Fixed ratesYour rate will never change.3
Variable ratesVariable rates are based on market conditions, so if market rates go up or down, so does your rate.



What you want, including a graduation present.

Interest Rate Reductions
Even a small percentage can make a big difference.

0.25% for automatic loan payment withdrawal4
An additional 0.25% if your automatic payment is from a SunTrust account4
1% principal balance reduction upon graduation5

Cosigners are great
If someone with a good credit history is a cosigner, your Custom Choice Loan is more likely to be approved. It could be an eligible parent, guardian, or a friend.
In-school Refinance Option
With this new option, you can refinance existing private student loans into a new Custom Choice Loan.

Your new loan will give you the flexibility to select a repayment term and repayment option that is right for you now.
The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance.
Learn more about the In-School Refinance Option.

        Certain restrictions and limitations may apply. SunTrust Bank reserves the right to change or discontinue these programs without notice. All loan programs are subject to approval and may not be available in certain jurisdictions.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.

So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Explanation Of Precision Pricing™ Savings






Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.



 




“To be able to pay off my student loans before their original term date and save so much on the life of the loan is huge.”
Noel True, NYU MFA – $85,900 Refinanced, $38,400 saved

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Types of Personal Loan

				Debt consolidation, home improvements and large purchases are just three of the top reasons why individuals may take out a loan. Personal loans allow individuals to borrow a sum of money which must be repaid in installments alongside interest.

Personal loans can be broken down into two categories: unsecured personal loans and secured personal loans. Secured loans require the borrower to pledge collateral against the loan. This means that if they default on the loan repayment the lender may take the item to cover the costs. The most common type of collateral is property but borrowers can also pledge vehicles, cash savings and more. As collateral reduces the risk associated with the loan, secured loans tend to have lower rates of interest.

Conversely, unsecured loans do not require the borrower to pledge any capital. As the lender carries more risk, these loans tend to sport higher interest rates.

As well as dividing loans into secured or unsecured loans, personal loans are also divided into tiers according to how much money you would like to borrow. Tier 1 loans are the smallest whereas Tiers 3 and 4 are the largest. 

There are also a number of very specific loans available. For example, car loans or logbook loans are secured against the value of a new car and payday loans give borrowers a small amount of money which can be repaid at the end of the month.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
