At Owens & Minor we believe that "together, we make healing happen," and that each individual team member contributes uniquely to make a difference. Join us on our journey.

















I worked part time in the warehouse during college. Years later, I relocated to my hometown and worked as a temp while job hunting. From there, I got an opportunity to be a trainer. Since then, I've been promoted twice. When I took that first job, I never would have imagined that Owens & Minor would be such a good place to grow my career.
 Sean Moses Western Regional Trainer 
















After the first couple of months working here, I was processing another order for a pallet of diapers, and it dawned on me ... that means a new baby was born! That's when the connection to patients became real for me.
 Chris Wyatt Inbound Receiving Leader, Richmond Distribution Center 
















I knew our company supported volunteerism and donations. But I was amazed what an impact we have on our communities during a hurricane or disaster recovery. I was really proud to be part of the team when Hurricane Matthew hit so many towns along the East Coast.
 Amee Dutko Account Specialist, Southeast Region

Owens & Minor Inc., founded in Richmond in 1882, is based in Hanover County.


JOE MAHONEY










































































































Hanover County-based Owens & Minor Inc. is planning to buy a New York-based distributor of medical supplies for about $380 million in cash.The acquisition will extend the company’s sales of medical supplies beyond hospital settings and into home health care.Owens & Minor, which distributes medical supplies and provides logistics services to health care providers, said it has signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Byram Healthcare, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mediq B.V., a supplier of medical devices and pharmaceuticals based in The Netherlands.Byram Healthcare is based in White Plains, N.Y., and sells medical supplies directly to patients and home health agencies.Owens & Minor said the acquisition is expected to contribute about $450 million in incremental annual revenue for the company. O&M reported profit of about $109 million in 2016 on revenue of $9.72 billion.The deal, announced late Tuesday and expected to close in the third quarter of this year, requires federal regulatory approval.
It will have “limited impact” on the company’s 2017 earnings and will be “modestly accretive” in 2018, Owens & Minor said.Byram Healthcare has 900 employees and sells medical supplies nationwide for wound care, urology, diabetes and incontinence.“Expanding across the continuum of care is a strategic imperative for us,” said P. Cody Phipps, Owens & Minor’s president and CEO, in a statement. “With the addition of Byram to the Owens & Minor family, we can quickly advance our strategic agenda with providers and manufacturers by expanding our reach beyond the hospital setting all the way to the patient’s home.”

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
