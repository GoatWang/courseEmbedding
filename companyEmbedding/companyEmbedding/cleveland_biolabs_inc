CBLB612
CBLB612, a clinical-stage investigational drug, is a synthetic lipopeptide. CBLB612 activates NF-kB pro-survival and immunoregulatory signaling pathways via specific binding to toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on a subset of body tissues and cell types that express this receptor.
Preclinical studies have shown that CBLB612 stimulates white blood cell regeneration. More recent research indicates that stimulation of these toll-like receptors may also enhance anti-tumor efficacy. We believe an opportunity may exist for CBLB612 to offer a single-dose alternative to existing hemopoietic growth factors.
A Phase 1, single-center, blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of CBLB612 in healthy volunteers was completed in the Russian Federation.
A Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study of CBLB612 as myelosuppressive prophylaxis in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy was initiated in the Russian Federation.

Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a focus on oncology development. It specializes in research and development of products with the potential to treat cancer and protect against death following acute radiation syndrome. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It has license agreements and collaborations with the Cleveland Clinic, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

History[edit]
Cleveland BioLabs was founded in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic in 2003 and moved to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in 2007.[1][2]
Products[edit]

CBLB502 (Entolimod, formerly Protectan) is the company's most advanced compound. It is being developed both as a radiation countermeasure and as a cancer treatment.[3] Entolimod is being developed and tested in two contexts: as an anti-radiation pharmaceutical, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, without human testing, and as an oncological, following the approval process for human pharmaceuticals.[4] Entolimod acts through activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 to mobilize antitumor immune response and reduce radiation effects on normal tissues.
CBL0137 is a novel small molecule that modulates FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription). The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.
CBL0102[4] is a Quinacrine, a compound with a long history of use in humans as a treatment for malaria, osteoarthritis and autoimmune disorders. More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

Financials[edit]

More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a focus on oncology development. It specializes in research and development of products with the potential to treat cancer and protect against death following acute radiation syndrome. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It has license agreements and collaborations with the Cleveland Clinic, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

History[edit]
Cleveland BioLabs was founded in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic in 2003 and moved to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in 2007.[1][2]
Products[edit]

CBLB502 (Entolimod, formerly Protectan) is the company's most advanced compound. It is being developed both as a radiation countermeasure and as a cancer treatment.[3] Entolimod is being developed and tested in two contexts: as an anti-radiation pharmaceutical, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, without human testing, and as an oncological, following the approval process for human pharmaceuticals.[4] Entolimod acts through activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 to mobilize antitumor immune response and reduce radiation effects on normal tissues.
CBL0137 is a novel small molecule that modulates FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription). The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.

The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.
CBL0102[4] is a Quinacrine, a compound with a long history of use in humans as a treatment for malaria, osteoarthritis and autoimmune disorders. More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

                Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, with a focus on oncology and acute radiation syndrome drug development. It is engaged in the research, development and commercialization of products that have the potential to treat cancer which reduces death from total body irradiation and counteract the toxic effects of radio and chemotherapies for oncology patients. The company has designed two oppositely-directed general therapeutic concepts: temporary and reversible suppression of apoptosis in normal cells to protect healthy tissues from stress-induced damage using compounds categorized as Protectans; and reactivation of apoptosis in tumor cells to eliminate cancer using compounds categorized as Curaxins. The company was founded by Andrei V. Gudkov and Yakov Kogan on June 5, 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, NY.

http://www.cbiolabs.com/  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CBLI  CLEVELAND BIOLABS, INC. engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of products for cancer treatment and protection of normal tissues from radiation and toxins in the United States. Its products in development include Protectans, the modified proteins of microbes that protect cells from apoptosis; and Curaxins, the small molecules that destroy tumor cells by simultaneously targeting two regulators of apoptosis. The company's lead product candidates, CBLB502 showed radioprotective efficacy as a single therapy in non-human primates; and Protectan CBLB612 provided protection in a mouse model from lethal hematopoietic-induced radiation sickness. In addition, it is developing Curaxin CBLC102, a Phase II clinical trial product, for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. CLEVELAND BIOLABS has a collaboration agreement with Cleveland Clinic Foundation to use Cleveland Clinic's research base underlying the company's therapeutic platform; strategic research partnership with Roswell Park Cancer Institute to develop its cancer and radioprotectant drug candidates; and strategic partnership with ChemBridge Corporation to access a chemical library of 214,000 compounds, and jointly manage the development and commercialization of compounds arising from selected projects. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York.

Entolimod (CBLB502) Biodefense
Entolimod is in development as a countermeasure against death following total body irradiation. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) results from damage to hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and other tissues due to high levels of radiation exposure, such as might occur following the explosion of a nuclear weapon. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for ARS.
Entolimod is a recombinant protein that acts as an agonist of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), an innate immunity receptor. Entolimod activation of TLR5 triggers NF-kB signaling, mobilizing an innate immune response that drives expression of numerous genes, including inhibitors of apoptosis, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and a spectrum of protective or regenerative cytokines.
It is not feasible or ethical to test the efficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure in humans; therefore, we are developing entolimod under the FDA’s Animal Rule guidance. The FDA established the Animal Rule in 2002 to permit the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not possible.
The efficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure has been assessed in animal models. These studies demonstrate that a single administration of entolimod given either before or after lethal total body irradiation leads to a significant improvement in animal survival. We have shown that entolimod reduces radiation damage to both hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues and improves tissue regeneration.
Our clinical studies of entolimod in 150 healthy human subjects have demonstrated the safety profile of entolimod and established the dose-dependent effect of entolimod on efficacy biomarkers in humans. In these studies, a transient mild to moderate flu-like syndrome was observed along with transient decreases in blood pressure and elevation of liver enzymes. Such effects are the most common adverse events and are consistent with increases in cytokines that are the expected consequences of entolimod administration.
We continue to discuss requirements for submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for entolimod with the FDA. In addition, a pre-Emergency Use Authorization, or pre-EUA dossier for entolimod has been submitted to the FDA for review. Pre-EUA is the regulatory path through which the FDA determines that certain unapproved medical products may be used in an emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Products with pre-EUA status can be purchased by the US government for stockpiling in the event of a disaster. The FDA granted entolimod both Fast Track and Orphan Drug status for reducing the risk of death following a potentially lethal dose of total body irradiation during or after a radiation disaster.
A Phase 1 study of entolimod in patients with advanced solid tumors at Roswell Park Cancer Institute has been completed. A second Phase 1 study of entolimod in patients with advanced cancer is currently ongoing in the Russian Federation to expand upon clinical observations made at the higher dose levels in the Roswell Park study and to gather further statistics on immune response to administrations of entolimod.

Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a focus on oncology development. It specializes in research and development of products with the potential to treat cancer and protect against death following acute radiation syndrome. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It has license agreements and collaborations with the Cleveland Clinic, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

History[edit]
Cleveland BioLabs was founded in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic in 2003 and moved to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in 2007.[1][2]
Products[edit]

CBLB502 (Entolimod, formerly Protectan) is the company's most advanced compound. It is being developed both as a radiation countermeasure and as a cancer treatment.[3] Entolimod is being developed and tested in two contexts: as an anti-radiation pharmaceutical, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, without human testing, and as an oncological, following the approval process for human pharmaceuticals.[4] Entolimod acts through activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 to mobilize antitumor immune response and reduce radiation effects on normal tissues.
CBL0137 is a novel small molecule that modulates FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription). The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.
CBL0102[4] is a Quinacrine, a compound with a long history of use in humans as a treatment for malaria, osteoarthritis and autoimmune disorders. More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

Financials[edit]

Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a focus on oncology development. It specializes in research and development of products with the potential to treat cancer and protect against death following acute radiation syndrome. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It has license agreements and collaborations with the Cleveland Clinic, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

History[edit]
Cleveland BioLabs was founded in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic in 2003 and moved to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in 2007.[1][2]
Products[edit]

CBLB502 (Entolimod, formerly Protectan) is the company's most advanced compound. It is being developed both as a radiation countermeasure and as a cancer treatment.[3] Entolimod is being developed and tested in two contexts: as an anti-radiation pharmaceutical, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, without human testing, and as an oncological, following the approval process for human pharmaceuticals.[4] Entolimod acts through activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 to mobilize antitumor immune response and reduce radiation effects on normal tissues.
CBL0137 is a novel small molecule that modulates FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription). The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.
CBL0102[4] is a Quinacrine, a compound with a long history of use in humans as a treatment for malaria, osteoarthritis and autoimmune disorders. More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBLI) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a focus on oncology development. It specializes in research and development of products with the potential to treat cancer and protect against death following acute radiation syndrome. The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It has license agreements and collaborations with the Cleveland Clinic, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, the Children’s Cancer Institute Australia, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

History[edit]
Cleveland BioLabs was founded in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic in 2003 and moved to the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in 2007.[1][2]
Products[edit]

CBLB502 (Entolimod, formerly Protectan) is the company's most advanced compound. It is being developed both as a radiation countermeasure and as a cancer treatment.[3] Entolimod is being developed and tested in two contexts: as an anti-radiation pharmaceutical, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, without human testing, and as an oncological, following the approval process for human pharmaceuticals.[4] Entolimod acts through activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 to mobilize antitumor immune response and reduce radiation effects on normal tissues.
CBL0137 is a novel small molecule that modulates FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription). The interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. It demonstrated reproducible antitumor effects in animal models of colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, head and neck and prostate cancers, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia and neuroblastoma.
CBL0102[4] is a Quinacrine, a compound with a long history of use in humans as a treatment for malaria, osteoarthritis and autoimmune disorders. More recently, it has been shown that CBL0102 interferes with a novel molecular target, the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex, resulting in simultaneous NF-kB suppression, Heat Shock Factor 1 suppression and p53 activation. Quinacrine has shown antitumor activity in subcutaneous human xenografts of renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma. Antitumor effects of CBL0102 were shown in vitro in several human tumor cell lines including melanomas, lung adenocarcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma.
CBLB612[4] is a proprietary compound based upon a natural activator of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimeric receptor. It structurally mimics naturally occurring lipopeptides of Mycoplasma to activate NF-kB via specific binding to TRL2, which suppresses cell death, stimulates the immune system and promotes tissue protection and regeneration. In 2009 the company assigned exclusive rights to development and marketing of CBLB612 in China to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.[5]
Revercom[4] is a preclinical cancer therapy consisting of a liposome-packaged proprietary small molecule named Reversan. Reversan is a small molecule inhibitor of the multidrug transporter MRP1, which is associated with development of tumor resistance to chemotherapy.
Mobilan[4] is a nanoparticle-formulated, recombinant non-replicating adenovirus developed as a universal cancer therapy.
Xenomycins[4] are antimicrobial and antifungal agents that target basic microbial transcription and replication by binding the DNA of pathogens.

Subsidiaries[edit]
Cleveland Biolabs has two majority-owned subsidiaries:

Incuron, LLC is a Russian Federation-based joint venture founded in 2010 between Russian Closed Mutual Venture Fund "Bioprocess Capital Ventures" and Cleveland BioLabs to develop product candidates CBL0102 and CBL0137 for oncology indications. As of December 31, 2013[update], Cleveland BioLabs owned %59.2 of Incuron.[4]
Panacela Labs, Inc. is a joint venture company founded in 2011 by Cleveland BioLabs and Open Joint Stock Company Rusnano in conjunction with Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Children's Cancer Institute Australia and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. As of December 31, 2013[update], Cleveland BioLabs owned 54.6% of Panacela.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
