Atlas Copco 8435 5185 10, Etx90-950Ct, Ext Inline Fixtured Nutrunner, 150-699 Ft Lbs | FlexibleAssembly.com



 












































































































Atlas Copco Product Index | 8435 5185 10
Atlas Copco 8435 5185 10 Etx90-950Ct, Ext Inline Fixtured Nutrunner, 150-699 Ft LbsFixtured nutrunners from Atlas Copco are designated QST or ETX. Both are designed to combine durability and reliability with high performance. 1 million duty cycles with +/- 2.5% accuracy makes ETX one of the most reliable tools on the market. ETX nutrunners are compact and easy to integrate in fixtures or robots; both pilot and sandwich mount are possible. ETX nutrunners are precalibrated and tested before delivery. A built-in memory chip in the ETX stores calibration values and general tool service data. 
With the wide range of socket holder lengths, from 0-200 mm, the ETX can handle most screw lengths and still ensure positive contact between socket and bolt during the tightening process. The socket holder is spring loaded and allows travel as the bolt moves away from the spindle body during tightening. The ETX has 50 mm spring travel length as standard, but 76 and 100 mm can be provided upon request.
Features:

High reliability
Calibration value stored in spindle
Robust connector

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.


  Full sets of plans only, such as PDF, 5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD, are eligible for this offer. 1-copy Sets, Study Sets, Additional Sets, Materials Lists are not eligible for this offer.

                    Come and see the historic and cute boutique like style of old town, Kapaa.  Lined with coconut trees and boutique shops and restaurants this quant little town is my home.  I grew up on the East side of Kauai, the Kapaa area.  Kapaa is central and is convenient to the main city of Li'hue as well as a direct drive to the nostalgic North Shore where the infamous  Hanalei bay lies and the fabulous five star hotel, The St. Regis.

                    Kapaa, also spelled Kapa'a, means "solid" in Hawaiian. Travelers find this small town, nestled at the base of Nounou (the Sleeping Giant) Mountain on Kauai tourist friendly with its diverse array of hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants. The Kinipopo Shopping Village is a favorite for its fun eateries and small keepsake shops. Look for the "Kauai Made" logo for products made by local craftsmen using traditional materials.
