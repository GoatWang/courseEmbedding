Hot Dang Redesign - ULTRA CREATIVE INC.

HOT DANG REDESIGNPackaging 


 


The Hot Dang package redesign focused on creating a distinct voice within the frozen  meat-alternative category and enhancing appetite appeal. The design is true to the brand – hip, playful, and slightly irreverent – but highlights the unique ingredients that go into the Hot Dang grain burger. The newest product to join the Hot Dang family is their Breakfast Toasters, also meat-free and in the freezer case, and needed to cue the morning occasion and feel distinctive from the main Grain Burger line.
