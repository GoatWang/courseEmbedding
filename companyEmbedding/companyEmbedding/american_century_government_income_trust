You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest. Each fund's prospectus or summary prospectus, which can be obtained by visiting americancentury.com, contains this and other information about the fund, and should be read carefully before investing. Investments are subject to market risk.

	Prior to March 1, 2010, the A Class was referred to as the Advisor Class and did not have a front-end sales charge. Performance prior to that date has been restated to reflect this charge.

	Historical performance for the C and R Classes prior to their inception is based on the performance of Investor Class shares. C and R Class performance has been adjusted to reflect differences in sales charges, if applicable, and expenses between classes.

	In January 2010, the fund's benchmark changed from the Citigroup Treasury/Mortgage Index to the Barclays Capital US Government/MBS Index.  This reflects a change in the portfolio management analytics software used by American Century's fixed-income teams.  The investment process is unchanged.
