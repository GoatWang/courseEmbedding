Not So Fast: The Supreme Court of Texas Narrows the Scope of the Economic Loss Doctrine [Subrogation & Recovery Alert]


            			            October 17, 2014
					            

                                    Historically, Texas courts have applied the economic loss doctrine (ELD) to bar tort claims (negligence and strict products liability) against a manufacturer or seller of a defective product when the damage is limited to the defective product itself and did not cause damage to a person or to other property. In addition, Texas courts have held that the ELD precludes tort recovery for economic loss arising from a party’s failure to perform under a contract when the harm consists only of the economic loss of a contractual expectancy.

                                    Fine art losses come in many shapes and sizes. Oftentimes, fine art is a relatively small piece of a homeowner's or commercial property claim.
