About the Author


A native of Utah s Wasatch Front, Shawn D. Moon has traveled the globe mostly for his professional career, but occasionally he travels to simply satisfy the urge to see beyond the present moment and local scenery. Accompanying him to many of the far-flung places is Michele, Shawn s wife, whom he met in the second grade. Sometime between recess and high school graduation they fell in love and, following Shawn s service in the Pennsylvania Philadelphia Mission but before graduation from Brigham Young University they were married. After a few moves, including time in Washington D.C., they eventually settled in Lindon, Utah, on the slope of a picturesque mountain where they, with their four bright, well-favored children enjoy music, theater, sporting events, and frequent visits from elk and deer herds that regularly ravage their lawn, trees, and garden, supplying motivation for constant vigil and healthy, strenuous activity.
