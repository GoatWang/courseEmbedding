We are offering 20,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used as set
forth in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our founder of up to $200,000. These loans will be
    repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering 
    proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other
    than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less 
    than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing
    working capital expenses.              

(3) The representatives have agreed to defer their underwriting commissions     
    equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, up to $6,000,000, which constitutes the       
    deferred underwriting commissions (or up to $6,900,000 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be paid to the            
    representatives from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining 
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of  
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our       
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or   
    for working capital. The representatives will not be entitled to any        
    interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.    

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business    
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a    
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional  
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special  
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we 
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due   
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
    fees for financing.                                                         

(6) Estimated amount of total retainer fees to be paid to the independent       
    directors in the two-year period from the closing of this offering.         

(7) Estimated amount of total franchise taxes to be paid by us in the two-year  
    period from the closing of this offering.                                   

(8) Our founder or its affiliates will agree to provide us with a loan of up to 
    $500,000 for working capital requirements after this offering and prior to  
    our initial business combination. In addition, in order to finance          
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business           
    combination, our founder or an affiliate of our founder or certain of our   
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us additional    
    funds as may be required.                                                   

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $200,000,000 (or approximately $230,000,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,000,000 (or up to $6,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
U.S. based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $20,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.01% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business
combination or (b) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do
not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes,
will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes for 2015.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the 
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or 
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of 
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial 
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working 
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our founder, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay OAGS
Management, LLC, an affiliate of our founder, a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our founder has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of August 1, 2015
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

Our founder or its affiliates will agree to provide us with a loan of up to
$500,000 for working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our
initial business combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs
in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founder or an
affiliate of our founder or certain of our officers and directors may, but are
not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required. If we complete
our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from the trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up
to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post
business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the
lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans, other
than the loan of up to $500,000 to be provided by our founder or its affiliates.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our founder, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the transaction agreement for our initial
business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum
net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise
their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset
requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the
redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may
search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable
to complete our initial business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to
which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to the founder
shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination. In addition, our initial stockholder has agreed to waive
its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
the founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our founder or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating
businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well
established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in
pursuing the acquisition of a target business. In addition, our ability to
identify a target business for our initial business combination will be limited
by the opportunities available in the onshore U.S. oil and natural gas industry.
Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public
stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources
available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding
warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed
favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a
competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business
combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses. We have not identified any


 potential 
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, 
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any 
potential business combination target. Our efforts in identifying prospective 
target businesses will be focused on the onshore U.S. oil and natural gas 
industry, however, we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business 
industry or sector.

We intend to focus our search on businesses that may provide opportunities for
attractive risk-adjusted equity returns. Our management and affiliates of our
founder have experience in identifying, acquiring, developing and operating
onshore oil and natural gas properties, which we believe will allow us to pursue
a broad range of opportunities.

Avondale Acquisition, a oil and gas SPAC formed by the former
CEO of Chesapeake Energy, announced terms for its IPO on Tuesday.



The Oklahoma City, OK-based company plans to raise $200 million by
offering 20 million units at a price of $10. At that price,
Avondale Acquisition would command a market value of $250 million.



Chairman Aubrey McClendon previously served as co-founder and CEO
of Chesapeake Energy (
CHK

) from 1989 to 2013.



Avondale Acquisition, which was formed in March 2015, plans to list
its units on the NASDAQ under the symbol AACOU. Avondale
Acquisition initially filed confidentially on March 3, 2015. Maxim
Group and Ladenburg Thalmann are the joint bookrunners on the deal.
No timing was disclosed.
