        Touchstone Enters into Purchase Agreement to Acquire Certain Assets of Sentinel Asset Management, Inc.
    
Touchstone Enters into Purchase Agreement to Acquire Certain Assets of Sentinel Asset Management, Inc.
Cincinnati (April 19, 2017) - Touchstone Investments and Sentinel Asset Management, Inc. (Sentinel), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of National Life Holding Company, announced today that Touchstone Advisors, Inc. (Touchstone), a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Financial Group (Western & Southern), has agreed to acquire certain assets relating to Sentinel’s business of providing investment advisory and investment management services to the Sentinel mutual funds.
The acquisition is expected to increase Touchstone’s assets under management to approximately $20 billion.
Sentinel currently manages 11 mutual fund strategies with combined assets under management of $5.54 billion as of Feb. 28, 2017.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, nine Sentinel retail funds and four Sentinel variable products funds will be reorganized into either existing Touchstone funds or into newly created Touchstone funds, and after the reorganizations, the funds will be advised by Touchstone.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Small Company and International Equity Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone funds that will be managed by the current Sentinel teams as part of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc.’s (Fort Washington) team of investment professionals. Fort Washington is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern. The Sentinel Common Stock Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Jamie Wilhelm, managing director and head of Public Equities at Fort Washington. Wilhelm and his team currently manage the Touchstone Focused Fund. The Sentinel Balanced Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Timothy J. Policinski, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Fort Washington.
The Sentinel Government Securities, Total Return Bond, Low Duration Bond, Multi-Asset Income and Sustainable Core Opportunities Funds are expected to be reorganized into existing Touchstone funds that will continue to be managed by the existing Touchstone funds’ current investment professionals at Fort Washington, ClearArc Capital, Inc., and Rockefeller & Co., Inc.
The Sentinel Unconstrained Bond Fund is not included in the terms of the purchase agreement.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Variable Products Balanced, Bond, Common Stock and Small Company Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone variable series funds, in each case managed by investment professionals at Fort Washington, except for the Small Company variable fund which will continue to be managed by the current Small Company portfolio management team.
Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the boards of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc., and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, as well as the approval of the shareholders of each applicable series of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc. and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. The board of trustees of the Touchstone funds has approved the transaction.
“Touchstone remains dedicated to its sub-advised mutual fund approach and is committed to offering investment products based on partnerships with premier money managers. This acquisition reflects Touchstone’s continued commitment to providing investors with access to best-in-class institutional money managers through its mutual funds,” said Steven M. Graziano, president of Touchstone Investments. “We also believe strongly in the value that financial advisors provide to the private client and institutional marketplace. As such, Touchstone distributes its funds through third-party intermediaries like registered investment advisors, private banks and consultants, as well as through national, regional and independent broker-dealers.”
“We believe that our Sentinel fund shareholders will be well served by the Touchstone family,” said Mehran Assadi, president and CEO of National Life Group. “Touchstone’s deep commitment to the retail mutual fund business, its investment strategies and shareholder services are very much in line with those of Sentinel.

Touchstone Enters into Purchase Agreement to Acquire Certain Assets of Sentinel Asset Management, Inc.
CINCINNATI – Apr. 19, 2017 – Touchstone Investments and Sentinel Asset Management, Inc. (Sentinel), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of National Life Holding Company, announced today that Touchstone Advisors, Inc. (Touchstone), a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Financial Group (Western & Southern), has agreed to acquire certain assets relating to Sentinel’s business of providing investment advisory and investment management services to the Sentinel mutual funds.
The acquisition is expected to increase Touchstone’s assets under management to $20 billion.
Sentinel currently manages 11 mutual fund strategies with combined assets under management of $5.54 billion as of Feb. 28, 2017.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, nine Sentinel retail funds and four Sentinel variable products funds will be reorganized into either existing Touchstone funds or into newly created Touchstone funds, and after the reorganizations, the funds will be advised by Touchstone.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Small Company and International Equity Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone funds that will be managed by the current Sentinel teams as part of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc.’s (Fort Washington) team of investment professionals. Fort Washington is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern. The Sentinel Common Stock Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Jamie Wilhelm, managing director and head of Public Equities at Fort Washington. Wilhelm and his team currently manage the Touchstone Focused Fund. The Sentinel Balanced Fund is expected to be reorganized into a newly created Touchstone fund that will be managed by a team led by Timothy J. Policinski, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Fort Washington.
The Sentinel Government Securities, Total Return Bond, Low Duration Bond, Multi-Asset Income and Sustainable Core Opportunities Funds are expected to be reorganized into existing Touchstone funds that will continue to be managed by the existing Touchstone funds’ current investment professionals at Fort Washington, ClearArc Capital, Inc., and Rockefeller & Co., Inc.
The Sentinel Unconstrained Bond Fund is not included in the terms of the purchase agreement.
It is anticipated that the Sentinel Variable Products Balanced, Bond, Common Stock and Small Company Funds will be reorganized into newly created Touchstone variable series funds, in each case managed by investment professionals at Fort Washington.
Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the boards of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc., and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, as well as the approval of the shareholders of each applicable series of Sentinel Group Funds, Inc. and Sentinel Variable Products Trust, and is expected to be completed in late 2017. The board of trustees of the Touchstone funds has approved the transaction.
"Touchstone remains dedicated to its sub-advised mutual fund approach and is committed to offering investment products based on partnerships with premier money managers. This acquisition reflects Touchstone’s continued commitment to providing investors with access to best-in-class institutional money managers through its mutual funds," said Steven M. Graziano, president of Touchstone Investments. “We also believe strongly in the value that financial advisors provide to the private client and institutional marketplace. As such, Touchstone distributes its funds through third-party intermediaries like registered investment advisors, private banks and consultants, as well as through national, regional and independent broker-dealers."
"We believe that our Sentinel fund shareholders will be well served by the Touchstone family," said Mehran Assadi, president and CEO of National Life Group. "Touchstone’s deep commitment to the retail mutual fund business, its investment strategies and shareholder services are very much in line with those of Sentinel. Touchstone will be a good home for our fund shareholders."
Berkshire Capital Securities LLC and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP are advising Sentinel on the transaction.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.
