This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV).

Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

We advise you to consider the fund's objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the fund. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.

There are risks associated with investing including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Fund's focusing investments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Please read the Fund's prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund's risk profile.

Fund Distribution Yield - Fund Distribution Yield is calculated by annualizing the most recent Fund distribution and dividing by the current Fund NAV. The yield represents a single distribution from the Fund and does not represent the total returns of the Fund.
SEC 30-day Yield – The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. This is also referred to as the "standardized yield"
IOPV – IOPV, or Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value, is a calculation disseminated by the stock exchange that approximates the Fund's NAV every fifteen seconds throughout the trading day.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund seeks to achieve long-term after-tax total return. The Fund looks to meet its objective by investing in what the managers, in their opinion, identify as companies high in quality.



The Approach
Stock selection is based primarily on a bottom-up process that identifies stocks through fundamental research. Managers consider a number of factors including company's earnings or cash flow capabilities, financial strength, the strength of the company's  business franchises and management team, sustainability of a company's competitiveness and estimates of the company's net value. The Fund seeks to minimize taxable distributions.



The Features
A team driven investment process led by an experienced portfolio manager focusing on stock selection as the primary driver of alpha1 generation. The Fund may also provide geographic, issuer and industry diversification2 across small-companies wit hin a risk managed framework, investing primarily in U.S. and foreign developed markets. The Fund may also invest in emerging market countries.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Prior to 8/7/15, Fund was called Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Small-Cap Value Fund and employed a different investment strategy. Please see prospectus for more details. Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of another Fund cla ss. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. The share class has no sales charge.

Aidan M. Farrell


Managed Fund since 2015






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Market conditions may limit the ability to generate tax losses or to generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The Fund's ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curt ailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Changes  in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry, including REITs.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Prior to 8/7/15, Fund was called Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Small-Cap Value Fund and employed a different investment strategy. Please see prospectus for more details. Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of another Fund cla ss. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. The share class has no sales charge.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund's bottom-up stock-picking approach aims to identify companies that the manager expects to achieve growth that exceeds the average of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. over the long term.



The Approach
We believe small-cap markets are becoming increasingly inefficient, so we seek to exploit this inefficiency with intensive fundamental research by searching for companies with experienced and proven management teams whose interests are aligned with inves tors.



The Features
Led by two portfolio managers with more than 35 years of collective investing experience and supported by a focused team of small-cap analysts. The team holds approximately 1,000 company meetings per year to construct a high conviction diversified portfo lio of quality small cap companies.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Max Sales Charge: 5.75%.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Investments in for eign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Market conditions may limit the ability to generate tax losses or t o generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The Fund's ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose  money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

5. The Morningstar Small Growth Category includes funds that invest primarily in U.S. small-cap companies with growth characteristics such as high earnings growth and high price ratios.
6. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
7. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time.

Eaton Vance  Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio  October 31, 2016 
  Notes to Financial Statements 
    1  Significant Accounting Policies  Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio (the Portfolio)
is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The Portfolios investment objective is to achieve long-term, after-tax returns. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue interests in the Portfolio. At October 31, 2016, Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Fund held an interest of 99.9% in the
Portfolio.  The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the Portfolio. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Portfolio is an investment company and follows accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946.
 A  Investment
Valuation  The following methodologies are used to determine the market value or fair value of investments.  Equity Securities. Equity securities listed on a U.S. securities exchange generally are valued at the last sale or closing price on the day of valuation or, if no sales took place on such date, at the mean
between the closing bid and asked prices therefore on the exchange where such securities are principally traded. Equity securities listed on the NASDAQ Global or Global Select Market generally are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price.
Unlisted or listed securities for which closing sales prices or closing quotations are not available are valued at the mean between the latest available bid and asked prices.  Foreign Securities and Currencies. Foreign securities and currencies are valued in U.S. dollars, based on foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party pricing service. The pricing
service uses a proprietary model to determine the exchange rate. Inputs to the model include reported trades and implied bid/ask spreads. The daily valuation of exchange-traded foreign securities generally is determined as of the close of trading on
the principal exchange on which such securities trade. Events occurring after the close of trading on foreign exchanges may result in adjustments to the valuation of foreign securities to more accurately reflect their fair value as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. When valuing foreign equity securities that meet certain criteria, the Portfolios Trustees have approved the use of a fair value service that values such securities to reflect market trading that
occurs after the close of the applicable foreign markets of comparable securities or other instruments that have a strong correlation to the fair-valued securities.  Affiliated Fund. The Portfolio may invest in Eaton Vance Cash Reserves Fund, LLC (Cash Reserves Fund), an affiliated investment company managed by Eaton Vance Management (EVM). While Cash Reserves Fund is
not a registered money market mutual fund, it conducts all of its investment activities in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. Investments in Cash Reserves Fund are valued at the closing net asset value per unit on the
valuation day. Cash Reserves Fund generally values its investment securities based on available market quotations provided by a third party pricing service. Prior to Cash Reserves Funds issuance of units in October 2016, the value of the
Portfolios investment in Cash Reserves Fund reflected the Portfolios proportionate interest in its net assets and the Portfolio recorded its pro rata share of Cash Reserves Funds income, expenses and realized gain or loss.
 Fair Valuation. Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value
using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees of the Portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value, or the amount that the Portfolio might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its
current sale in the ordinary course. Each such determination is based on a consideration of relevant factors, which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the type of security, the
existence of any contractual restrictions on the securitys disposition, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities, quotations or relevant information obtained from
broker/dealers or other market participants, information obtained from the issuer, analysts, and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded securities), an analysis of the companys or entitys financial condition, and an
evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer and the market(s) in which the security is purchased and sold.  B  Investment Transactions  Investment transactions for financial statement purposes are accounted for on a trade date basis.
Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined on the basis of identified cost.  C  Income  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities. However, if the
ex-dividend date has passed, certain dividends from foreign securities are recorded as the Portfolio is informed of the ex-dividend date. Withholding taxes on foreign dividends and capital gains have been provided for in accordance with the
Portfolios understanding of the applicable countries tax rules and rates. Interest income is recorded on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount. Distributions from investment
companies are recorded as dividend income, capital gains or return of capital based on the nature of the distribution.  D  Federal Taxes  The Portfolio has elected to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. No provision is made by the
Portfolio for federal or state taxes on any taxable income of the Portfolio because each investor in the Portfolio is ultimately responsible for the payment of any taxes on its share of taxable income. Since at least one of the Portfolios
investors is a regulated investment company that invests all or substantially all of its assets in the Portfolio, the Portfolio normally must satisfy the applicable source of income and diversification requirements (under the Internal Revenue Code)
in order for its investors to satisfy them. The Portfolio will allocate, at least annually among its investors, each investors distributive share of the Portfolios net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses and any
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit.  As of October 31, 2016, the Portfolio had no uncertain tax positions that would require
financial statement recognition, de-recognition, or disclosure. The Portfolio files a U.S. federal income tax return annually after its fiscal year-end, which is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years from
the date of filing.

Eaton Vance  Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio  October 31, 2016 
  Notes to Financial Statements  continued 
    E  Foreign Currency Translation  Investment valuations, other assets, and
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are translated each business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases and sales of foreign investment securities and income and expenses denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon currency exchange rates in effect on the respective dates of such transactions. Recognized gains or losses on investment transactions attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains and losses on investments. That portion of unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.
 F  Use of
Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  G  Indemnifications  Under the Portfolios organizational documents, its
officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Portfolio. Under Massachusetts law, if certain conditions prevail, interestholders in the Portfolio could be
deemed to have personal liability for the obligations of the Portfolio. However, the Portfolios Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of liability on the part of Portfolio interestholders and the By-laws provide that the
Portfolio shall assume the defense on behalf of any Portfolio interestholder. Moreover, the By-laws also provide for indemnification out of Portfolio property of any interestholder held personally liable solely by reason of being or having been an
interestholder for all loss or expense arising from such liability. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Portfolios maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred.  2  Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates  The investment adviser fee
is earned by Boston Management and Research (BMR), a subsidiary of EVM, as compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the Portfolio. Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement and subsequent fee reduction agreement
between the Portfolio and BMR, the fee is computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Portfolios average daily net assets up to $500 million, and is payable monthly. On net assets of $500 million and over, the annual fee is reduced. The fee
reduction cannot be terminated or reduced without the approval of a majority vote of the Trustees of the Portfolio who are not interested persons of BMR or the Portfolio and by the vote of a majority of the holders of interest in the Portfolio. For
the year ended October 31, 2016, the Portfolios investment adviser fee amounted to $186,845, or 0.75% of the Portfolios average daily net assets. Pursuant to a voluntary expense reimbursement, BMR was allocated $14,670 of the
Portfolios operating expenses for the year ended October 31, 2016. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement effective November 16, 2015, BMR pays Eaton Vance Management (International) Limited (EVMI), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
of Eaton Vance Corp., a portion of its investment adviser fee for sub-advisory services provided to the Portfolio. The Portfolio invests its cash in Cash Reserves Fund. EVM does not currently receive a fee for advisory services provided to Cash
Reserves Fund.  During the year ended October 31, 2016, BMR reimbursed the Portfolio $28,539 for a trading error. The effect of the loss incurred
and the reimbursement by BMR of such amount had no impact on total return.  Trustees and officers of the Portfolio who are members of EVMs or
BMRs organizations receive remuneration for their services to the Portfolio out of the investment adviser fee. Trustees of the Portfolio who are not affiliated with the investment adviser may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of
their annual fees in accordance with the terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For the year ended October 31, 2016, no significant amounts have been deferred. Certain officers and Trustees of the Portfolio are officers of the above
organizations.  3  Purchases and Sales of Investments  Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations, aggregated $22,929,964 and $36,017,119, respectively, for the year ended October 31, 2016. 
4  Federal Income Tax Basis of Investments 
The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments of the Portfolio at October 31, 2016, as determined on a federal income tax basis, were as
follows:   











 Aggregate cost
 
$
21,134,298
  




 Gross unrealized appreciation
 
$

Eaton Vance  Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio  October 31, 2016 
  Notes to Financial Statements  continued 
    The net unrealized depreciation on foreign currency transactions at October 31, 2016 on a federal income tax basis was $595.  5  Line of Credit  The Portfolio participates with other portfolios and funds managed by EVM
and its affiliates in a $545 million unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks, which is in effect through September 1, 2017. Borrowings are made by the Portfolio solely to facilitate the handling of unusual and/or unanticipated
short-term cash requirements. Interest is charged to the Portfolio based on its borrowings at an amount above either the Eurodollar rate or Federal Funds rate. In addition, a fee computed at an annual rate of 0.15% on the daily unused portion of the
line of credit is allocated among the participating portfolios and funds at the end of each quarter. Because the line of credit is not available exclusively to the Portfolio, it may be unable to borrow some or all of its requested amounts at any
particular time. The Portfolio did not have any significant borrowings or allocated fees during the year ended October 31, 2016. 
6  Risks Associated with Foreign Investments  Investing in securities issued by companies whose principal business activities are outside the United States may involve significant risks not present in domestic investments. For example, there is generally less
publicly available information about foreign companies, particularly those not subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws. Certain foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting, auditing, and
financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers. Investments in foreign securities also involve the risk of possible adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations,
expropriation or confiscatory taxation, limitation on the removal of funds or other assets of the Portfolio, political or financial instability or diplomatic and other developments which could affect such investments. Foreign securities markets,
while growing in volume and sophistication, are generally not as developed as those in the United States, and securities of some foreign issuers (particularly those located in developing countries) may be less liquid and more volatile than
securities of comparable U.S. companies. In general, there is less overall governmental supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets, broker/dealers and issuers than in the United States. 
7  Fair Value Measurements  Under
generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the assumptions, referred to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is
summarized in the three broad levels listed below.   



 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 



 
 Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
  



 
 Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level disclosed is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.  At October 31, 2016, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolios investments, which are carried at value, were as
follows:

Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio  October 31, 2016   
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    To the Trustees and Investors of Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio:  We have audited the accompanying statement
of assets and liabilities of Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio (the Portfolio), including the portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2016, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Portfolios management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Portfolio is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2016, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tax-Managed Global Small-Cap Portfolio as of October 31, 2016, the
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP  Boston, Massachusetts  December 19, 2016

IMPORTANT NOTICES   
 
Privacy.  The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial
privacy. Each of the financial institutions identified below has in effect the following policy (Privacy Policy) with respect to nonpublic personal information about its customers: 
 



 
 Only such information received from you, through application forms or otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will be collected. This
may include information such as name, address, social security number, tax status, account balances and transactions.   



 
 None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed to anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to employees
necessary to service your account). In the normal course of servicing a customers account, Eaton Vance may share information with unaffiliated third parties that perform various required services such as transfer agents, custodians and
broker-dealers.   



 
 Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality of such
information.   



 
 We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time upon proper notification to you. Customers may want to review our Privacy Policy periodically for
changes by accessing the link on our homepage: www.eatonvance.com.  Our pledge of privacy applies to the following entities within the
Eaton Vance organization: the Eaton Vance Family of Funds, Eaton Vance Management, Eaton Vance Investment Counsel, Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., Eaton Vance Trust Company, Eaton Vance Management (International) Limited, Eaton Vance
Managements Real Estate Investment Group and Boston Management and Research. In addition, our Privacy Policy applies only to those Eaton Vance customers who are individuals and who have a direct relationship with us. If a customers
account (i.e., fund shares) is held in the name of a third-party financial advisor/broker-dealer, it is likely that only such advisors privacy policies apply to the customer. This notice supersedes all previously issued privacy disclosures.
For more information about Eaton Vances Privacy Policy, please call 1-800-262-1122. 
Delivery of Shareholder Documents. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits funds
to deliver only one copy of shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
householding and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders. Eaton Vance, or your financial advisor, may household the mailing of your documents indefinitely unless you instruct Eaton Vance, or your financial advisor,
otherwise. If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial advisor. Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will typically be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your financial advisor.  Portfolio Holdings. Each Eaton Vance Fund and its underlying Portfolio(s) (if applicable) will file a schedule of portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the SEC for the first and third
quarters of each fiscal year. The Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance website at www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the EDGAR database on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. Form N-Q may also be reviewed
and copied at the SECs public reference room in Washington, D.C. (call 1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the public reference room).  Proxy Voting. From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their
underlying Portfolios (if applicable) vote proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds and Portfolios Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and procedures and information on how the Funds
or Portfolios voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended June 30, without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122 and by accessing the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

Item 2. Code of Ethics 
The registrant has adopted a code of ethics applicable to its Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. The
registrant undertakes to provide a copy of such code of ethics to any person upon request, without charge, by calling
1-800-262-1122. The registrant has not amended the code of ethics as described in Form
N-CSR during the period covered by this report. The registrant has not granted any waiver, including an implicit waiver, from a provision of the code of ethics as described in Form N-CSR during the period covered by this report.  Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert 
The registrants Board has designated William H. Park, an independent trustee, as its audit committee financial expert. Mr. Park is a certified
public accountant who is a private investor. Previously, he served as a consultant, as the Chief Financial Officer of Aveon Group, L.P. (an investment management firm), as the Vice Chairman of Commercial Industrial Finance Corp. (specialty finance
company), as President and Chief Executive Officer of Prizm Capital Management, LLC (investment management firm), as Executive Vice 



President and Chief Financial Officer of United Asset Management Corporation (an institutional investment management firm) and as a Senior Manager at Price Waterhouse (now PricewaterhouseCoopers)
(an independent registered public accounting firm).  Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule) prohibits
an accounting firm, such as the Portfolios principal accountant, Deloitte & Touche LLP (D&T), from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, the Loan Rule
provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit clients equity securities. Based
on information provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees (the Audit Committee) of the Eaton Vance family of funds by D&T, certain relationships between D&T and its affiliates (Deloitte Entities) and its
lenders who are record owners of shares of one or more funds within the Eaton Vance family of funds (the Funds) implicate the Loan Rule, calling into question D&Ts independence with respect to the Funds. The Funds are providing
this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances as well as D&Ts conclusions concerning D&Ts objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audits of the Funds. 
D&T advised the Audit Committee of its conclusion that, in light of the facts surrounding its lending relationships, D&Ts objectivity and
impartiality in the planning and conduct of the audits of the Funds financial statements will not be compromised, D&T is in a position to continue as the auditor for the Funds and no actions need to be taken with respect to previously issued
reports by D&T. D&T has advised the Audit Committee that these conclusions were based in part on the following considerations: (1) Deloitte Entity personnel responsible for managing the lending relationships have had no interactions
with the audit engagement team; (2) the lending relationships are in good standing and the principal and interest payments are up-to-date; (3) the lending
relationships are not significant to the Deloitte Entities or to D&T.  On June 20, 2016, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) issued no-action relief to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter (June 20, 2016)
(the No-Action Letter)) related to the auditor independence issue described above. In the No-Action Letter, the SEC indicated that it would not recommend
enforcement action against the fund group if the auditor is not in compliance with the Loan Rule provided that: (1) the auditor has complied with PCAOB Rule 3526(b)(1) and 3526(b)(2); (2) the auditors
non-compliance under the Loan Rule is with respect to certain lending relationships; and (3) notwithstanding such non-compliance, the auditor has concluded that it
is objective and impartial with respect to the issues encompassed within its engagement as auditor of the funds. Based on information provided by D&T, the requirements of the No-Action Letter appear to be
met with respect to D&Ts lending relationships described above. After giving consideration to the guidance provided in the No-Action Letter, D&T affirmed to the Audit Committee that D&T is an
independent accountant with respect to the Funds within the meaning of the rules and standards of the PCAOB and the securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. The SEC has indicated that the
no-action relief will expire 18 months from its issuance. 


(a)-(d)  The
following table presents the aggregate fees billed to the registrant for the registrants fiscal years ended October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2016 by D&T for professional services rendered for the audit of the registrants
annual financial statements and fees billed for other services rendered by D&T during such periods.

(1) 
Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the registrants financial statements and are not reported
under the category of audit fees. 


(2) 
Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning and specifically include fees for tax return
preparation and other related tax compliance/planning matters. 


(3) 
All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and services provided by the principal accountant other than audit, audit-related, and tax services. 
(e)(1) The registrants audit committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the pre-approval of
services provided by the registrants principal accountant (the Pre-Approval Policies). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a framework intended to
assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies (i) specify certain types of
audit, audit-related, tax, and other services determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate specific procedures governing the mechanics of the
pre-approval process, including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees. Unless a service is specifically
pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrants audit committee at least annually. The registrants audit committee maintains full responsibility for the appointment, compensation,
and oversight of the work of the registrants principal accountant.  (e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the
registrants audit committee pursuant to the de minimis exception set forth in Rule 2-01 (c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X. 
(f) Not applicable.   (g) The following table presents
(i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed to the registrant by D&T for the registrants fiscal years ended October 31, 2015 and
October 31, 2016; and (ii) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed to the Eaton Vance organization by D&T for the same time periods.

(1)
Certain entities that provide ongoing services to the registrant are subsidiaries of Eaton Vance Corp. 
(h) The registrants audit committee has considered whether the provision by the registrants principal accountant of
non-audit services to the registrants investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, 



or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountants independence.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 2/28/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5] business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.




StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

Vanguard Equity Index Group
			
Product management

Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap Fund seeks a tax-efficient total return consisting of long-term capital appreciation and nominal current income. The fund tracks the investment performance of the Standard & Poor’s SmallCap 600 Index—an unmanaged benchmark representing small-capitalization U.S. stocks. The advisor uses portfolio optimization techniques to select a sample of stocks that, in aggregate, reflect the characteristics of the benchmark index. Vanguard uses proprietary software to implement trading decisions that accommodate cash flow and maintain close correlation with index characteristics. In addition, a disciplined sell process minimizes the realization of net capital gains and may include the realization of losses to offset unavoidable gains. The experience and stability of Vanguard’s Equity Index Group have permitted continuous refinement of indexing techniques designed to minimize tracking error and provide tax-efficient returns.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.
Prior to buying or selling options, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options brochure (PDF), also known as the options disclosure document. It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options.

Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
