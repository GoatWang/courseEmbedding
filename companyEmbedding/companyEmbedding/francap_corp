You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

After seven years, 91% of new franchises are still in business, as compared to only 20% of individual new start-up businesses.
- U.S. Department of Commerce


Franchising: Marketplace of the 21st Century




The Opportunity




The outlook for the franchise industry is that it will continue to grow in the coming years. The opportunity has been born of the need for specialized and knowledgeable funding and development of developmental stage franchise product and/or service concepts. We believe there is an opportunity in the franchise marketplace for a franchise development firm, such as FranCap, to partner with either existing or prospective franchisors to build their franchise operations rather than charge large upfront or ongoing cash fees for franchise development services such as most other franchise consulting firms that currently operate in the marketplace today.
In addition, we believe that meaningful investment support for aspiring franchisors has been almost entirely neglected until now. It is this void that FranCap intends to fill by sourcing of capital investments to qualified start-up and/or established early stage businesses, whose principals in concert with FranCap's Management Team, believe a successful franchise product or service can be speedily developed, packaged, registered, marketed and profitably managed.






Value Proposition




The value proposition that FranCap offers to existing small established businesses (that have the potential to become franchise operations) and to existing early stage franchisors (that have the potential to become large successful franchisors) is to provide them with the franchise development expertise and capital sources that will enable them to potentially become large national brands.






The Cost




FranCap's compensation for providing its franchise development services is generally performance based. In other words, FranCap may derive its revenue primarily from a revenue sharing arrangement with the franchisor in exchange for providing the franchisor with FranCap's franchise development services. In addition, FranCap may also take a small equity position in the franchisor.






Franchise Targets




FranCap's search for suitable franchise development opportunities is generally directed towards small and medium-sized enterprises which have the desire to develop and license their franchise rights. Typical franchise opportunity targets will: (i) be development stage entities with established "proof of concept"; (ii) be experiencing financial or operating difficulties; or (iii) be in need of expertise and funds to develop a franchise system.






Industry Segments




FranCap will primarily seek target opportunities in the following industry segments:

Automotive
Business Services
Commercial and Residential Services
Lodging
Personal Services
Quick Service Restaurants
Table/Full Service Restaurants
Real Estate
Retail Food
Retail Products and Services

Why Franchise?




Why Should I Consider Franchising My Business?
There are many reasons to consider expanding your business through franchising. However, there are also other expansion strategies that you may want to consider. By way of example, you may decide to expand your business through the development of company-owned locations. While this option may give you complete control over all of your operations, the disadvantage of expanding through adding company-owned locations is that it usually requires a significant investment of capital, time and other resources, which can slow down the development process. The advantage of expanding a business through franchising is that the franchisee puts up the money and other resources needed for the business. This generally allows the business to expand and build its brand at a much faster rate.
Businesses Best Suited To Franchising
Not all businesses are suitable for expansion through franchising. Although many types of business concepts are potential candidates for franchising, a successful franchise generally has some degree of distinctiveness, or the potential to achieve distinctiveness, in its business segment. If it does not, it will have difficulty attracting suitable franchisees in an increasingly competitive market for such persons. A franchise may be distinctive in terms of its products, services, operations and delivery systems or marketing. If a business is to be successfully expanded by franchising, its success must be attributable to its products or services, business format, operating or management systems and marketing. In addition, the business must be teachable to prospective franchise buyers and must be easily replicable by such persons. To be successful, a franchised business must appeal to qualified franchise buyers and compare favorably with other franchises in the same market category.
The Decision to Franchise Your Business
Making the decision to expand an existing business through franchising can represent a watershed moment in the furtherance of your strategic business plan. The first step in this process is to determine if your business is franchisable or not. This generally involves the meeting with an experienced franchise development consultant to assess the potential to franchise your business concept. However, before a final decision is made by a prospective franchisor to go forward with developing a franchise program, the franchise development consultant will typically recommend the preparation of a feasibility study to analyze the market potential, completion, brand awareness, expansion potential and other relevant factors. Should the feasibility study indicate that developing a franchise program is a viable strategy for the expansion of the business, the next step is to commence the franchise development process.






Franchise Development Process




The Franchise Development Process
Developing a franchise program for a prospective franchisor typically involves working with numerous franchise professionals including a franchise attorney, accountant, franchise development consultant, sales and marketing consultant and others. Depending on the complexity of the business and other factors, the franchise development process can take anywhere from 7 to 12 months, more or less, to complete including closing the first sale of a franchise. There are several phases of the franchise development process which are described in more detail below:



Development and Analysis of the Franchise Structure


Initial client meeting
Concept review
Onsite analysis
Prepare feasibility study
Develop franchise program structure




Preparation of Franchise Documentation


Draft Franchise Agreement

Ongoing Maintenance

Exit Strategies




Potential Franchisor Exit Strategies
There are several exit strategies that a franchisor may consider at the appropriate time including a merger or acquisition, registration of the company's securities (i.e., IPO, mini IPO, etc.), or other exit strategy. To get the most money from the sale of the business, the franchisor must anticipate that a potential buyer of the business will be requesting a great deal of due diligence information that will be needed to support the sale price of the business. Therefore, it is never too early to start preparing for the due diligence process. In order to be adequately prepared for a possible acquisition, sale or registration of the franchisor's securities, the franchisor must start early and consider what information would be needed by the prospective buyer (whether an institutional investor, private equity firm or other entity) or underwriter of the company's securities.
