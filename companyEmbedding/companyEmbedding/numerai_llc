A nice, accessible article by the founder.
If they haven't already, the Q team may want to have a look at this one.

We’re buying, regularizing and encrypting all of the financial data in the world and giving it away for free.
By requiring that you upload predictions, instead of the code related to your model, we ensure that you can retain all intellectual property rights to your model.
We want you to be able to remain completely anonymous on Numerai. To facilitate anonymity, we offer payments in Bitcoin as well as USD.

For Q, I'm wondering if this sort of approach might be better.  Basically, only farm out the problems that they need help with, versus trying to get the crowd to write entire stand-alone, institutional-grade trading strategies (that mere mortals wouldn't trade with their own money anyway, since millions to tens of millions of dollars are required).  Plus, the arbitrary software and hardware constraints of Q are removed.  The Numerai crowd is free to pick their own analysis tools, and deploy them on their own desktop/cloud high-performance computing platforms.
Sounds like they already have their hedge fund up and running:

We use predictions from our platform to trade global securities in our hedge fund, Numerai Fund 1, LP operated by the management company Numerai, LLC. Our independent fund administrator is SS&C Technologies, Inc. and our prime broker is Interactive Brokers, LLC  













Frank Vigilante






Any one want to collaborate on Numerai? I threw a couple ML algos at the data this week, and managed to crack #39 on the leaderboard for the upcoming month. Would love to swap prediction figures, or compare approaches to the data.

@Grant
"(that mere mortals wouldn't trade with their own money anyway, since millions to tens of millions of dollars are required)."
I would have thought that a good number of users here build algos and also trade the algos with their own capital (real money) via connecting their Q algos with brokers (e.g. Interactive Brokers).  In fact, I imagine this could also be a revenue stream for Q here - to take a cut of commission generated with such trading activities. 
Numerai would not have such commission sharing revenue model.  They pay out cash to purchase quality info from the crowd.

Chic-a-Peas, LLC is voluntarily recalling a limited number of Chic-a-Peas Baked Crunchy Chickpeas 2 oz. packages because the product has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.There have been no reports of consumer illness associated with this recall. We are voluntarily recalling these items out of an abundance of caution.A limited quantity was distributed online and in retail stores nationwide. Retailers and distributors who received the recalled lots have been contacted and asked to pull these lots from their inventory and shelves.This announcement applies only to the Chic-a-Peas Baked Crunchy Chickpeas products listed below and does not include any other items outside the below lot codes:Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Sea Sat Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/27/2017 UPC: 853404004033Lot Code: 0867Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Fresh Salsa Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/27/2017UPC: 853404004071Lot Code: 0877Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Falafel Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/28/2017 UPC: 853404004026Lot Code: 0897The lot codes and best by dates can be found on the back of the package.This recall has been initiated because our manufacturing company notified us that Listeria monocytogenes was found in the production environment and it may have the potential to contaminate this product.Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to return them to the place of purchase to request a refund.If you have any questions, you can reach out to us at info@chicapeas.com or at (800) 481-5716 Monday- Friday 9AM – 5PM (EST).

WHAT IS PROACTIVE WELLNESS?
Today’s personal emergency response solutions are largely reactive, home based, and lack solutions to promote healthy living. We at Numera are convinced that to live healthier longer, the solutions must allow for proactive engagement and early intervention.
Numera’s proactive wellness solutions integrate health device measurements (including weight scales, blood pressure meters, pulse oximeters and thermometers) with Numera Libris mPERS device and web-based Numera EverThere platform. Our solutions provide a more complete picture of overall health and wellness, enable prevention activities to effectively manage chronic conditions and follow-up care, while also reducing the financial burden on caregivers. 
We also acknowledge the seniors’ desire to live mobile and active lives while feeling safe.  Our solutions are multi-functional and cellular-based, providing tools for both personal security and virtual care, anywhere and anytime.


TESTIMONIALS


Mobile technologies hold great promise for keeping people healthy, managing diseases, and lowering healthcare costs.
