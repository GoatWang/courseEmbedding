ALPS Agrees To Acquire Listed Private Equity Specialist Red Rocks Capital LLC

DENVER, April 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ALPS, a DST Company that provides products and services to the financial services industry, today announced it has agreed to acquire asset manager Red Rocks Capital LLC, a leader in listed private equity and other private asset investments. 
The purchase price of up to $65 million will consist of a combination of up-front cash consideration and performance-related contingent consideration. The transaction will be funded using a combination of cash and short-term borrowings on revolving credit lines.
The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second half of 2015. 
Red Rocks, founded in 2003 by Adam Goldman and Mark Sunderhuse, is the first and largest domestic money manager to package listed private equity products in a '40-Act structure. The firm manages and advises $1.8 billion in assetsi through a variety of product structures, including mutual funds, sub-advised relationships, separately managed accounts, and select variable annuity contracts.
"Acquiring a best-in-class manager like Red Rocks Capital gives us a distinct edge in the alternative investments marketplace," says Ned Burke, CEO of ALPS Holdings, Inc. "This transaction represents an important step in our ongoing asset management strategy."
Golden, Colorado-based Red Rocks has been sub-adviser to the ALPS|Red Rocks Listed Private Equity Fund from its inception in 2007. The offering is now one of the largest actively-managed mutual funds in the U.S. that focuses on providing access to listed private equity investments.
"We have come to know the Red Rocks team quite well over the years," says Tom Carter, President of ALPS Advisors, Inc. "Everything in our experience tells us that ALPS and Red Rocks are going to do great things together for the investment community. I'm confident this acquisition will benefit all parties involved over the long term."
Goldman and Sunderhuse, who collectively represent more than 60 years of experience in private equity and public fund management, are expected to continue in their roles as co-managers for the Red Rocks strategy.
"Our goal has always been to provide investors and financial professionals with access to one of the world's most desired asset classes," says Goldman. "As part of ALPS and the DST Enterprise, we'll be in far greater position to expand the breadth and reach of Red Rocks' offerings."
In addition to its investment products, Red Rocks also created and maintains the Red Rocks Global Listed Private Equity Index, a benchmark for private equity firms that are publicly traded on nationally-recognized exchanges worldwide.
DST, ALPS' parent company, expects the transaction to result in an $0.08 to $0.10 dilution of earnings per share for the 12 months following the acquisition and be slightly accretive to earnings per share in the subsequent 12 months. The dilution following acquisition is driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets and by the expense recognition associated with the estimated future performance-related payments due to the principals of Red Rocks.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as financial advisor and Vedder Price acted as legal counsel to Red Rocks Capital on the transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom acted as legal counsel to DST and ALPS on the transaction. The acquisition is subject to certain agreed upon conditions precedent and customary closing conditions and approvals.

Listed Private Equity



 
 



Listed Private Equity
Characteristics
Benefits
Glossary







Listed Private Equity

Private equity consists of investors and funds that make investments directly into private and public holdings or conduct buyouts of public companies that result in a delisting of public equity.  Capital for private equity is raised from retail and institutional investors, and can be used to fund new technologies, expand working capital within an owned company, make acquisitions, or to strengthen a balance sheet.  The majority of private equity consists of institutional investors and accredited investors who can commit large sums of money for long periods of time. Private equity investments often demand long holding periods to allow for a turnaround of a distressed company or a liquidity event such as an IPO or sale to a public company.*
Listed private equity (LPE) companies are publicly traded vehicles that generally invest capital in privately held businesses. They may also take positions of significant influence and/or control in publicly traded businesses. The model and structure can be similar to those of traditional private equity funds, except that LPE companies are publicly traded in the open market. Simply stated, LPE is a different approach to accessing the same asset class.
Red Rocks Capital has identified a global investment universe of over 500 private equity companies and funds with an aggregate market capitalization of over $500 billion which represents over 10% of the total global private equity universe of $3.8 trillion.**
*Investopedia
            **Preqin, January 2015




Characteristics

Some common characteristics of Listed Private Equity (LPE) include:

LPE is an ownership interest in a set of investments that are traded in the open market on recognized financial exchanges every day. These ownership interests are no different than what an investor in a traditional private equity partnership might hold; investments in a set of businesses with the objective of maximizing total return at the end of an investment period.
LPE vehicles are structured as common equity (or shares), units in investment trusts or units in publicly traded limited partnership interests.
LPE vehicles typically take the form of direct private equity investments, fund of fund private equity investments (both primary and secondary fund interests, along with their future funding commitments) or an interest in the management company that oversees various investment funds/business units. Listed private equity vehicles can also be some combination of the above, or a hybrid.
LPE is a permanent pool of capital. Once raised, the capital of a listed private equity vehicle is recycled from one deal to the next. This represents a significant difference in the business model for a private equity manager and offers options not available through traditional limited partnerships.
An LPE company may also offer traditional limited partnership-based funds that they manage alongside the LPE vehicle. In this instance, the private equity company is investing both the LPE vehicle’s capital along with the limited partnership-based fund’s capital in the same deals or businesses, at the same time, on the same terms, thereby leveraging the deal flow, due diligence and ongoing work of the private equity managers for the benefit of both vehicles.
LPE vehicles can be structured to focus on senior loans, mezzanine debt or secured/unsecured debt investments. In some cases, a private equity manager may have an LPE equity vehicle that focuses on the debt side of the capital structure along with a traditional limited partnership-based fund(s) that invests in the equity side of a deal. The LPE vehicle may invest in the senior loan, mezzanine debt or secured/unsecured debt in a deal while the traditional limited partnership-based fund(s) invests in the equity side of the same deal.








Benefits

Potential benefits of the listed private equity (LPE) market include: 

Access to Private Equity Opportunities to invest in private equity funds have traditionally been available to well connected, very large institutions. LPE companies are available to retail investors and institutions of all sizes with low minimum investment amounts required.
Access to many of the best managers As a result of the investment banking and initial public offering process, it is typical to see only the best private equity companies able to become public.
Diversification A traditional private equity fund may invest in less than ten companies and are often concentrated by industry, stage of investment and subject to vintage year risk. By owning a basket of LPE stocks, investors can have exposure to hundreds of companies across various industries, countries, stage of investment (early, mid, late) and reduce exposure to the ‘J curve’ effect (the point where traditional private equity funds reach breakeven).
Investment Horizon Private investment funds or partnerships typically have a fixed life of 8-12 years. LPE companies are perpetual investment vehicles with no set life. Therefore, investments and liquidity decisions are based on the goal of maximizing long term return for shareholders.
Liquidity LPE companies are traded on public markets and offer a high level of liquidity whereas private equity funds are typically purchased at the beginning of the fund's life. Investors in traditional private equity funds are usually paid back through distributions over the life of that fund. Additionally, the structure of traditional private equity funds makes withdrawing an investment prior to the end of the fund's life difficult.
Long-term Investment Unlike private funds which have a pre-determined life span that often requires them to distribute proceeds at set points in time, LPE companies choose to re-invest or distribute proceeds from liquidated investments based on current market opportunities.
Pricing Private equity funds and partnerships are typically priced quarterly and usually take 3 months for valuations/prices to be determined. Pricing of investments within private funds are generally not scrutinized to the same degree or held to the same standards as publicly traded private equity companies. Within private funds there is great resistance to quickly mark investment values ﻿﻿upward or downward.
Reasonable FeesManagers of private equity funds typically charge fees based on total committed capital or fund size regardless of whether investments are made and are not as impacted by performance of investments. Listed private equity companies typically have tiered fee schedules based on success of the holding company, performance of portfolio investments, and/or the amount invested.
Transparency Public companies are required to disclose financial conditions and their investments. Activities of listed public companies and estimated values of investments can be observed on a timely basis.
YieldMany of these public companies return investment income, dividends and interest to investors while retaining proceeds from liquidated investments.








Glossary


Asset managers Asset managers are companies listed on a regulated markets which derive their income from managing private equity or private debt portfolios and from balance sheet investments in funds they manage.
Business development companies Business development companies are companies listed on a regulated US market and generate returns through direct investments (equity) in and loan capital (debt) to private companies at all stages of development.
Buyout Buyout typically refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company, business unit or business asset is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of financial leverage.
Carried interest The cut private equity firms take when the funds they manage make a profit. This serves as an incentive for fund managers with the remaining profits distributed to investors.
Club deals When private equity firms team up to go after large targets. Private equity firms often say these deals help spread out risk and leverage firm-level expertise.
Distressed debt The bonds of firms that have filed for, or are on the verge of, bankruptcy.
Fund-of-funds Funds-of-funds are listed on a regulated market and produce returns through investments in several private equity funds.
General partnerThe manager of a private equity fund. This can refer to the private equity firm itself, or the senior partners of a private equity firm. Some of the biggest private equity firms include Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Carlyle Group, TPG (formerly Texas Pacific Group) and Bain Capital.
Growth Capital Growth capital refers to minority investments in mature companies. It is a type of investment suited to a diverse range of growth opportunities, including acquisitions, increasing production capacity, market or product development, turnaround opportunities, shareholder succession and change of ownership situations.
Holding companies Holding companies are companies listed on a regulated market which generate returns through investments in unlisted or listed firms with a private equity approach (significant participation, active involvement, focus on exits and maintaining board seats).
Leveraged buyout When a company is bought with mostly borrowed money. The loan is frequently secured by the assets of the target firm.
Limited partnersThe investors in a private equity fund. These are usually institutional investors like pension funds and endowments looking for better returns and diversification than those generated in public markets.
Listed private equity (LPE) LPE is made up of listed vehicles that invest in private equity companies or vehicles. Such vehicles may take the form of corporations, unit trusts, publicly traded partnerships, or other structures, and may focus on mezzanine, buyout or venture capital investments.
Management fee An annual fee investors pay to general partners to manage a private equity fund.
Mezzanine Financing Private placements of unsecured, subordinated debt. Due to higher risk relative to senior debt, investors receive higher interest payments and in many cases ‘equity kickers’ in the form of equity warrants.
Multiple ArbitrageOther than operational improvements, these are tactics that increase the value of a portfolio company between buying and selling it, such as: buying several related companies and combining them into a single entity, merging a private company with a public entity, or repositioning a company to compete in markets and industries with more potential.
Operational Improvement Changes that improve the operating margins of a company, such as: supply chain optimization, product/SKU profitability and rationalization, product enhancements or new product introductions, pursuit of new geographic or market segments, IT investments/rationalization, sales team/sales process optimization, marketing enhancements, and real estate/facilities rationalization.
Venture Capital Seeks to provide cash financing to promising start-ups and companies in early stages of growth in return for an equity stake. It is often the riskiest private equity subclass and tends to focus on the technology and life sciences industries.
Vintage yearThe legal inception date as stated in a private equity fund's financial statement.

ALPS Agrees To Acquire Listed Private Equity Specialist Red Rocks Capital LLC






Apr 9, 2015, 12:25pm EDT















DENVER, April 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ALPS, a DST Company that provides products and services to the financial services industry, today announced it has agreed to acquire asset manager Red Rocks Capital LLC, a leader in listed private equity and other private asset investments. 
The purchase price of up to $65 million will consist of a combination of up-front cash consideration and performance-related contingent consideration. The transaction will be funded using a combination of cash and short-term borrowings on revolving credit lines.
The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second half of 2015. 
Red Rocks, founded in 2003 by Adam Goldman and Mark Sunderhuse, is the first and largest domestic money manager to package listed private equity products in a '40-Act structure. The firm manages and advises $1.8 billion in assetsi through a variety of product structures, including mutual funds, sub-advised relationships, separately managed accounts, and select variable annuity contracts.
"Acquiring a best-in-class manager like Red Rocks Capital gives us a distinct edge in the alternative investments marketplace," says Ned Burke, CEO of ALPS Holdings, Inc. "This transaction represents an important step in our ongoing asset management strategy."
Golden, Colorado-based Red Rocks has been sub-adviser to the ALPS|Red Rocks Listed Private Equity Fund from its inception in 2007. The offering is now one of the largest actively-managed mutual funds in the U.S. that focuses on providing access to listed private equity investments.
"We have come to know the Red Rocks team quite well over the years," says Tom Carter, President of ALPS Advisors, Inc. "Everything in our experience tells us that ALPS and Red Rocks are going to do great things together for the investment community. I'm confident this acquisition will benefit all parties involved over the long term."
Goldman and Sunderhuse, who collectively represent more than 60 years of experience in private equity and public fund management, are expected to continue in their roles as co-managers for the Red Rocks strategy.
"Our goal has always been to provide investors and financial professionals with access to one of the world's most desired asset classes," says Goldman. "As part of ALPS and the DST Enterprise, we'll be in far greater position to expand the breadth and reach of Red Rocks' offerings."
In addition to its investment products, Red Rocks also created and maintains the Red Rocks Global Listed Private Equity Index, a benchmark for private equity firms that are publicly traded on nationally-recognized exchanges worldwide.
DST, ALPS' parent company, expects the transaction to result in an $0.08 to $0.10 dilution of earnings per share for the 12 months following the acquisition and be slightly accretive to earnings per share in the subsequent 12 months. The dilution following acquisition is driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets and by the expense recognition associated with the estimated future performance-related payments due to the principals of Red Rocks.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as financial advisor and Vedder Price acted as legal counsel to Red Rocks Capital on the transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom acted as legal counsel to DST and ALPS on the transaction. The acquisition is subject to certain agreed upon conditions precedent and customary closing conditions and approvals.

Industry and Academic Studies
Harvard Business School - What Do Private Equity Firms Say They Do?:
                      In a groundbreaking study, the authors survey 79 private equity firms managing more than $750 billion in capital, and provide granular information on PE managers' practices in determining capital structure, valuing transactions, sourcing deals, governance, and operational engineering. Among the findings, very few investors use DCF or net present value techniques to evaluate investments, relying instead on internal rates of return and multiples of invested capital.
LPEQ Listed Private Equity Review 2015:
                      LPEQ, the industry association of listed private equity companies, publishes an annual review of member profiles, their investment strategies, NAV (net asset value) and share price performance information.

                      Bain and Company, one of the leading management consulting firms in the world, publishes an annual review and outlook for private equity. The report includes both insights and outlook for private equity globally.
EY - Private Equity Equity Survey 2015:
                      Positioning to win – the EY 2015 global private equity survey in collaboration with Private Equity International.
Commonfund Institute - Alternatives Reality: What to Expect From Future Allocations:
                      Commonfund Institute's study concludes that allocations to alternatives has created and should continue to create higher performance in comparison with allocations solely to traditional assets.
McKinsey & Co. - The $64 Trillion Question: Convergence in Asset Management:
                      Alternative investment assets hit a record high of $7.2 trillion in 2013 and the category has doubled in size since 2005, with global assets under management (AUM) growing at an annualized pace of 10.7 percent—twice the rate of traditional investments. This article highlights four trends that are driving growth: 1) disillusionment with traditional asset classes and products; 2) evolution in state-of-the-art portfolio construction; 3) increased focus on specific investment outcomes; and 4) a hard-to-close gap of commitments to beneficiaries.
Boston Consulting Group - The Advantage of Persistence in Private Equity Performance:
                      In this article, BCG consultants suggest that top private equity performers have developed a set of distinctive capabilities that have differentiated them from their rivals.  Going forward, either the capabilities of the top performers will turn out to be the source of sustainable competitive advantages that drive the consolidation of the private equity sector or they will simply define a new and higher standard of performance that—as public companies and other private-equity firms learn how to copy those capabilities—will stimulate a new round in the global competition for capital.
McKinsey and Co. - How Alternative Investments are Going Mainstream:
                      Globally, alternative assets under management more than doubled between year-end 2005 and year-end 2011, to $6.5 trillion. This pace represents a compounded annual growth rate of 14 percent over the period, far outstripping traditional asset classes. McKinsey's 2012 report, The Mainstreaming of Alternative Investments, is an informative look at the evolution and mainstreaming of alternative investments for both institutions and retail investors.
Institutional Investment in Listed Private Equity:
                      This study from Douglas Cumming, Associate Professor and Ontario Research Chair, York University - Schulich School of Business looks at the institutional investor’s propensity to invest in listed private equity.
Alternatives In Traditional Portfolios:
                      In this excerpt from Morningstar’s Alternative Investment Observer, Ibbotson Associates Senior Portfolio Manager Scott Wentsel discusses innovations in the mutual fund marketplace and how this evolution has opened the door to alternative strategies, including private equity, for the average investor. He then examines the potential benefits of adding alternatives to traditional portfolios.
Another Block in Building a Portfolio:
                      Research from Ibbotson Associates shines light on the role private equity should play in portfolios.
PE-Backed Companies Weathered the Great Recession Better Than Peers:
                      This paper addresses the important policy and business question of whether companies acquired through leveraged buyouts and similar transactions are more likely to default on their obligations than other non-investment grade firms.

We are all familiar with the rapid evolution in the world of technology. IPods replaced CDs, which replaced cassette tapes, which replaced 8-tracks and so on. With each step, the consumer benefited from technological enhancements that were previously reserved for governments, large corporations and select, wealthy individuals.
A similar evolution has been occurring in the financial services industry. Mutual funds were introduced in the 1920's to address the prohibitive cost associated with owning stock. REITS in the 1960's, separately managed accounts in the 1970's and exchange-traded funds in the 1980's all evolved in response to consumer demand for access to the latest investing 'enhancement'. Continuing the evolution, Red Rocks Capital launched their first domestically packaged listed private equity products in 2006 and, in doing so, provided today's financial professional access to many of the same high-quality private equity managers that have historically been reserved for the institutional investor.
For decades private equity was the one diversifier available to institutional investors that was largely unavailable to the individual investor. Advisors looking to replicate the Endowment Model (often referred to as the Yale Model) found their alternative strategies portfolio lacking a significant asset class. Now, by combining the Red Rocks private equity strategy with other offerings in the market, advisors are able to offer their clients and prospects access to a full complement of alternative assets.
In addition to access to some of the world's top private equity managers, the Red Rocks Strategy offers low minimums, daily liquidity, transparency and broad diversification in a structure free from placement fees and performance fees.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
               Bloomberg data from 6/30/2012 - 6/30/2017
The Index is designed to track the performance of private equity firms which are publicly traded on any nationally recognized exchange worldwide. These companies invest in, lend capital to, or provide services to privately held businesses. The Index is comprised of 40 to 75 public companies representing a means of diversified exposure to private equity firms. The securities of the Index are selected and rebalanced quarterly per modified market capitalization weights.
Market capitalization may be adjusted to represent a means of diversified exposure to private equity firms, as well as the consolidated exposure of the underlying portfolio investments. Considerations for diversification include the consolidated stage of investment (early, mid, late), type of capital (equity, debt, mezzanine, etc.), sector (energy, industrials, technology, etc.), and geography.

Index Information

Request Information


GLPE Index Methodology
Index membership and maintenance is determined by the Red Rocks Capital Index Committee. The Index is rebalanced at the end of each calendar quarter. There are no intra-quarter additions. Intra-quarter deletions occur only following de-listings from major stock exchanges.
Index Membership

Private Equity: Companies must have, or a stated intention of reaching, a majority of their assets invested in, or loans to, private businesses. Investments or loans must be made with at least five unrelated privately held businesses.
Domicile: Companies may be domiciled anywhere but the publicly traded stock must be listed on a recognized exchange.
Market Capitalization: Must be greater than $100 million.
Business Type: The publicly traded stocks within the Index may be, but are not limited to, the following: Business Development Companies, publicly traded limited partnership interests, Investment Holding Companies, Special Purpose Acquisition Corporations, publicly traded Venture Capital Funds, Closed End Funds, Financial Institutions, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and any other vehicle whose primary purpose is to invest in, or lend capital to, privately held companies.
Excluded Business Types: In order to minimize additional layers of fees, investment vehicles intended for the sole purpose of representing pooled investments or fund-of-funds of privately held businesses will be avoided.

Index Removal

Index Violations: Substantial violations to the criteria stated above are removed from the Index.
Private Equity Purity: Changes in or prolonged interruptions to focus of investments from private equity.

Modified Market Capitalization Weighting

Market Capitalization: Primary weighting of stocks within the Index is based on stock market capitalizations.
Diversification: Market capitalization may be modified in the interest of consolidated exposure of the underlying investments of Index constituents. Sector diversification is targeted to be similar to recognized industry weightings by other major Indices. Consolidated stage of investment is to be similar to the typical large institutional private equity portfolio: 65% late stage, 25% mid stage, and 10% early stage.
Private Equity Purity: Further adjustments to market capitalization may be made to companies experiencing diminishing exposure to private businesses or relatively unclear direct exposure versus other companies.
Restrictions: The Index holds a minimum of thirteen securities and a 10% maximum weight of individual securities. Companies that represent a 5% or greater weighting will not in aggregate equal more than 50% of the index. Securities with average daily volume less than $250,000 will be added to the index at a 0.25% weight, with changes at rebalance limited to 0.25% up or down. An exception may be to companies removed from the index following corporate actions.



GLPE Index Composition
The Index is composed of direct investments in over 60 public companies and indirect investments in over 1,000 private businesses. The top 10 direct investments are broken down in the table below.

*This report has been prepared by Red Rocks Capital from data believed to be reliable, but no representation is made as to accuracy or completeness. Returns are based on a simulated index from October 1, 1995 to September 27, 2007 and an actual index from September 28, 2007 to Present. Red Rocks Capital calculated the hypothetical results by taking a snapshot of the index as of September 28, 2007 and back-testing performance to October 1, 1995. The hypothetical performance results are back-tested and are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent decisions made by the adviser during the period described. Such results were compiled after September 27, 2007 and do not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the adviser's decision-making if the adviser was actually maintaining the index during that time. Hypothetical back-tested performance has inherent limitations. It does not reflect actual market activity and it is not indicative of future results. The performance of the index for the period from September 28, 2007 to present was actual. The results portrayed reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. The index included securities that track the performance of private equity firms that are publicly traded. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and future investments have the potential for loss as well as profit. Index returns shown are not reflective of actual investor performance or do they reflect fees and expenses applicable to investing. One cannot invest directly in an index.

Financial Professionals

We are all familiar with the rapid evolution in the world of technology. IPods replaced CDs, which replaced cassette tapes, which replaced 8-tracks and so on. With each step, the consumer benefited from technological enhancements that were previously reserved for governments, large corporations and select, wealthy individuals.
A similar evolution has been occurring in the financial services industry. Mutual funds were introduced in the 1920's to address the prohibitive cost associated with owning stock. REITS in the 1960's, separately managed accounts in the 1970's and exchange-traded funds in the 1980's all evolved in response to consumer demand for access to the latest investing 'enhancement'. Continuing the evolution, Red Rocks Capital launched their first domestically packaged listed private equity products in 2006 and, in doing so, provided today's financial professional access to many of the same high-quality private equity managers that have historically been reserved for the institutional investor.
For decades private equity was the one diversifier available to institutional investors that was largely unavailable to the individual investor. Advisors looking to replicate the Endowment Model (often referred to as the Yale Model) found their alternative strategies portfolio lacking a significant asset class. Now, by combining the Red Rocks private equity strategy with other offerings in the market, advisors are able to offer their clients and prospects access to a full complement of alternative assets.
In addition to access to some of the world's top private equity managers, the Red Rocks Strategy offers low minimums, daily liquidity, transparency and broad diversification in a structure free from placement fees and performance fees.
