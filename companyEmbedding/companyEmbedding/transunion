Decision View
When a subscriber code is selected, all TransUnion services validated for that subscriber code will display as options.
What does the L2C Thin File Model do?
Our L2C Thin File Model uses alternative data to identify creditworthy prospects among previously unscoreable consumers and predict the likelihood of their accounts becoming 90 days or more delinquent in a 12-month period. This insight - in the form of an easy-to-read score - can be used to increase consumer loyalty and repeat business by offering better credit terms or first-time credit to underserved buyers, and improve operational efficiency through real-time credit decisions and reduced manual review costs.
What do Authorized User Alerts do?
TransUnion's Authorized User Alerts help reduce the impact of authorized user abuse by notifying you about the potential for artificial score inflation using your own specific risk threshold as a guide. These alerts immediately advise you when a large number and/or percentage of active trades on an individual's credit file has an authorized user status and display such activity in the Special Messages section of the TransUnion credit report.
What is a Model Report?

The TransUnion Model Report was designed for customers who do not need the full level of detail provided by a Credit Report. It contains three standard sections:

Indicative information
Special messages
Model profile (optional)

It does not include collections, public records, tradelines, or inquiries. The Model Report uses all the information that is on a full Credit Report to calculate a risk score or other algorithm, if requested. The risk score can be used to generate a custom message.
What does High Risk Fraud Alert do?
High Risk Fraud Alert helps manage risk by providing specific information about potentially fraudulent situations. High Risk Fraud Alert generates a series of over 50 separate notifications based upon data received. The notifications will suggest further examination of the address, Social Security Number (SSN), or telephone number corresponding to the High Risk Fraud Alert Message returned.
What is Creditor Contact Information?
Creditor Contact Information is a standalone transaction that decodes individual codes for trades, collections, and public records, but not inquiry codes. Creditor Contact Information returns the subscriber's name, address, and, if available, telephone number.
What is ID Search?
ID Search uses subscriber-provided name and address information to return a subject's social security number (SSN) and other indicative information (excluding employment/salary). If the SSN is included in the input, a search is done across market areas.
What is Total ID®?
Total ID automatically provides access to Reverse Phone Append and the Total ID fraud verification logic. It is a quick and accurate identity verification and application service, providing both fraud detection and a reduction in manual review time. Total ID is identified by product code: 06710.
Total ID provides enhanced fraud detection by:

Performing identity verification. It matches application data against multiple databases and returns mismatch results. Total ID checks a variety of multi-sourced databases with national coverage and timely updates.
Application analysis. It helps determine if application data is valid by looking for inconsistencies in the application information.
 

What is Reverse Phone Append?
Reverse Phone Append is a TransUnion non-permissible product that uses only a phone number as input and does not return any credit information. It can return phone number ownership of both business and residential information, specific characteristics of the phone number, and any noted restrictions.
What is ID Report?
ID Report is a search tool that uses name and Social Security Number (SSN) for application evaluation and information verification when extending credit, collecting debt, or conducting employment screening. Permissible purpose is required, as this product uses TransUnion's consumer credit database and returns name, addresses and Social Security Number. A consumer statement and the number of hard inquires on the file are also returned. ID Report is available for individual inquiries only. High Risk Fraud Alert, ID Mismatch Alert, and Phone Append are available as add-on products.
What is the Batch User role?
In order to use TransUnion Direct's batch services, a user needs to be assigned the Batch User role. Batch Services currently available are Express Portfolio Review and Collection Prioritization Engine. The Company or Location Administrator assigns the role to users through the TransUnion Direct Administration site within the User Details section for that individual. Other users with access to the same subscriber code will not have access to batch services unless the user has been enabled as a Batch User.
What does SSN Search do?
SSN Search uses an individual's Social Security Number to return up to six different files. Name, current address and up to two previous addresses are returned on each file. A date reported is returned on the current and first previous address in each file.
What is Fraud Detect?
Fraud Detect is a personal and business identification verification system designed to prevent application fraud. Fraud Detect uses a variety of algorithms to determine the validity of personal identifiers provided by a consumer or business applicant.
What is Phone Append?
Phone Append is an add-on product that will attach a ten-digit telephone number (including area code) to a variety of core products. Phone Append searches for a consumer's telephone number in a national telephone number database owned by an independent supplier.
The number retrieved from the national phone number database will be displayed in the regular telephone field on the report unless it is unlisted or unpublished. The actual number for unlisted or unpublished numbers will not be returned, but an indicator will show that a private number was found.
What information is returned on a Collection Credit Report?
A Collection Credit Report is a comprehensive summary of the following information:
1.  Subject Name Information
2.  Address Information: Current address and two previous addresses
3.  Personal Information: Includes Social Security Number (SSN), birth date, and telephone number.
4.  Employment Information: The two most recent jobs are returned when present on the consumer file.
5.  Date of Last Activity and Activity Type: Both items are reported to show the most current information on the subject's file. The date of last activity is taken from a date on a public record, tradeline, or inquiry.
6.  Special Messages: Returned in the special message section, when applicable. Messages include a special deceased message, FCRA messages concerning bankruptcy, account closed by consumer or account in dispute.
7.  Model Profile: Includes any scores for models validated for the subscriber.
8.  Public Record Information
9.  Tradeline Information
10.  Inquiry Information
11.  Consumer Statement Information: If the file contains a consumer statement
12.  Owning Bureau Information

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
