Faculty
Northwestern Pritzker School of Law has a rich tradition of faculty excellence. Throughout our history, our faculty members have been engaged in major public policy debates, and that tradition is alive and well today. Northwestern Law has faculty addressing and speaking out on cutting-edge legal issues ranging from medical malpractice reform to intellectual property’s transformation in a digital age. It is our diversity of interests and expertise that distinguishes us.
That diversity carries over to the kinds of scholarship represented on our faculty. Northwestern has a remarkably interdisciplinary faculty. We have faculty working at the intersection of law and many other disciplines, including economics, psychology, philosophy, political science, sociology, and history. We have distinguished legal theorists as well as one of the strongest cohorts of empirical scholars in any law school. One of the notable features of our faculty is the high degree of scholarly collaboration between faculty who come to the scholarly enterprise with different kinds of training and different methodologies.
Together, our faculty members combine to form what is, we believe, the most eclectic and balanced mix of legal scholars among our nation’s law schools. Their diverse mix of expertise and research methodologies allows them to bring a unique perspective to both their scholarship and teaching. And our more than 30 clinical faculty members provide one of the most comprehensive clinical programs anywhere through the 14 centers and more than 20 clinics of our Bluhm Legal Clinic.
We also have one of the lowest student-faculty ratios, so our students enjoy an unusual amount of individual access to these scholars, even after graduation.
Northwestern Law students have access to the most interdisciplinary research faculty in the nation. No other law school can boast as high a percentage of PhD-trained faculty members. Northwestern Law has the highest percentage (48 percent) of full-time research faculty with PhDs in the nation.

Biography
Karen Daniel is a Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions (CWC). She supervises second- and third-year law students in the representation of convicted persons with claims of innocence in state and federal court proceedings and before the Governor’s clemency board.  She also speaks frequently about her work and the causes of wrongful convictions.  Since joining the CWC in 2000, Professor Daniel and her students have freed numerous wrongfully convicted clients, achieving exonerations in both DNA and non-DNA cases.  In 2012, Professor Daniel co-founded the Women’s Project of the Center on Wrongful Convictions.  Professor Daniel is a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former member of the Illinois Office of the State Appellate Defender, where she represented hundreds of convicted defendants on appeal and supervised staff attorneys and law student interns.

Professor Daniel's clients at the Center on Wrongful Convictions have included Michael Evans, who served 27 years in prison for a murder he did not commit prior to his exoneration through DNA testing; Dana Holland, who was freed after a decade of incarceration for two wrongful convictions; Randy Steidl, who became the 18th and most recent former Illinois death row inmate to be exonerated since the Illinois death penalty was reinstated in 1977; Marlon Pendleton, who was exonerated by DNA testing in 2006; Robert Wilson, whose conviction for a 1997 attempted murder was vacated nearly 10 years later after the victim admitted she was mistaken in her identification of him; Julie Rea Harper, who was acquitted of the murder of her son after a retrial in 2006; and Alan Beaman, whose 1995 murder conviction was reversed by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2008 based on prosecutorial misconduct.
