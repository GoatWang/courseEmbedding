(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
       
(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. On each
    of August 19, 2016 and January 11, 2017, we borrowed $150,000 under the 
    promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses
    of this offering. The $300,000 will be repaid upon completion of this 
    offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
    for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions)
    and amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund 
    such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriter's
    deferred commissions (or $15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
   
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a "no shop" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this 
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private 
placement warrants, $375,000,000 (or $431,250,000 if the underwriter's 
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or
$15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $750,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to fund
our Regulatory Withdrawals and/or to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months 
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest 
rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income
taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and se
cretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. On each of
August 19, 2016 and January 11, 2017, we borrowed $150,000 under the promissory
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of 
January 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private 
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We 
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such 
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds
in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's "penny stock" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to 
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of 
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our 
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability
to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout


 this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any
potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any
potential business combination target.

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or
sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to
identify, acquire and manage a business that can benefit from our operational
expertise, as members of our management team have done in diverse sectors,
including industrials, technology, telecommunications, media and entertainment,
business services, healthcare and consumer products. This operationally-oriented
investment approach has served The Gores Group well since its founding in 1987.

We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify
operationally-oriented acquisition opportunities in the marketplace and that our
contacts and transaction sources, ranging from owners and directors of private
and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, lenders,
attorneys, accountants and other trusted advisors across various sectors, will
allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. Our team is led by
Alec Gores, our Chairman, who has more than 35 years of experience as an
entrepreneur, operator and private equity investor. Over the course of his
career, Mr. Gores and his team have invested in more than 100 portfolio
companies through varying macroeconomic environments with a consistent,
operationally-oriented investment strategy.

Together with a team of operations professionals spanning key business
functional areas, as well as dedicated investment origination and mergers and
acquisitions professionals, Mr. Gores developed a formula that led to numerous
marquee investments and business transformations, with a strong focus on
carve-out acquisitions from large corporate transaction partners, including:

• The Learning Company from Mattel Corporation;

• VeriFone from Hewlett-Packard Company;

• Micron PC from Micron Electronics, Inc.;

• Sagem Communications from the Safran Group;

• Stock Building Supply from Wolseley plc;

• The broadcast communications division from Harris Corporation;

• The electronics power systems business from TE Connectivity Ltd.;

• Elo Touch Solutions from TE Connectivity Ltd.;

• Therakos from Johnson & Johnson; and

• Brand-Rex from Honeywell International, Inc.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
