A Differentiated Approach to Value Investing
Third Avenue is a private investment firm rooted in our collective value-driven investment philosophy. Since our founding in 1986, we have consistently pursued a fundamental, bottom-up approach to deep value and distressed investing–we focus on the company’s balance sheet, the value of its underlying assets, and the discounted price of its securities.  Our distinct investment approach seeks what we believe are the best risk/reward opportunities across geographies, industries, market capitalizations and throughout the capital structure.
 
Long Tenured Management Team
Third Avenue’s Management Committee has full responsibility for the leadership of the Firm. The Management Committee has been in place since 2002 when Affiliated Managers Group (“AMG”) invested in Third Avenue. On average, the Management Committee has provided a decade of service to the Firm. Our refined management structure ensures that its leadership team is represented by senior members of each of our functional departments.
 
Team-Based Investment Approach
Our investment strategies leverage the collective expertise across investment teams. Our team approach enables us to generate and evaluate ideas from multiple perspectives and to efficiently identify the part of the asset class or capital structure that offers the most compelling risk/return opportunity.

Michael Winer | Lead Portfolio Manager, Real Estate

Lead Portfolio Manager | Joined in 1995
Third Avenue Real Estate Value Strategy
Mr. Winer has managed the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund since its inception in 1998. He is also the co-portfolio manager of the Third Avenue Real Estate Opportunities Fund LP.
As a real estate securities analyst for Third Avenue in the mid-1990s, Mr. Winer convinced his colleagues that real estate should be (and in fact always had been) an essential part of the firm’s value investing arsenal. This led to Third Avenue establishing its first sector fund — a new concept for a firm whose generalist approach runs deep. Since then, Mr. Winer has played crucial roles in several unique, landmark Third Avenue investments, including the firm’s participation in reorganizing Kmart (which was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy), where Mr. Winer determined that Kmart’s real estate assets provided a substantial margin of safety for Kmart’s stakeholders.
Prior to joining Third Avenue in 1994, Mr. Winer was Vice President of the Asset Sales Group for Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. where he was responsible for evaluating and underwriting portfolios of distressed real estate loans. He had previously been First Vice President of Society for Savings, a Connecticut savings bank, and Director of Asset Management for Pioneer Mortgage, a financial institution, where he directed the workout, collection and liquidation of distressed real estate loan and asset portfolios.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Winer was the Co-Founder and Chief Financial Officer of Winer-Greenwald Development, Inc., a California-based real estate development firm that specialized in the development, construction, ownership and management of commercial properties. Mr. Winer previously held executive positions at Pacific Scene, Inc., and The Hahn Company, both California-based real estate development firms. Mr. Winer began his career in public accounting with Deloitte & Touche (formerly Touche Ross & Co.) where he specialized in real estate development companies.
Mr. Winer holds a B.S. in Accounting from San Diego State University. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Tejon Ranch Co., a public company that owns the largest continuous expanse of private land in California and Five Point Holdings LLC, a public company with three large master-planned communities in coastal California.  Mr. Winer serves on the Board of Trustees of the Future Citizens Foundation (dba The First Tee of Monterey County) and the Pacific Legal Foundation (a public-benefit law firm).

In Value Investor Insight:  “The market isn’t giving the Forest City adequate credit for de-risking their strategy”
Third Avenue Real Estate Value team is featured in the May 31, 2016 issue of Value Investor Insight.  The team discusses Forest City Realty Trust’s “de-risked” operating strategy, its focus on core markets, and its valuable portfolio of diverse properties.  Reprinted below with permission from Value Investor Insight.

Down to Earth
Long-admired real estate developer Forest City Enterprises’ rocky navigation of the financial crisis seems to have put investors persistently on edge. Has the time finally come to forgive and forget? By Ted Crawford
Long considered a commercial real estate development powerhouse, Forest City Enterprises took it on the chin in the financial crisis, forced to raise equity at dilutive prices after overextending both its balance sheet and development pipeline. From a high above $70 in 2007, the shares fell below $3.50 in March 2009.
Now a real estate investment trust, the company has made strides in climbing back into the market’s good graces.  It generates predictable cash flows from a diverse portfolio of properties in desirable markets. Higher-profile examples include The New York Times Building in Manhattan, Atlantic Center in Brooklyn, The Yards mixed-use development adjacent to Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., and a life-sciences property portfolio around the M.I.T. campus in Cambridge, MA.  Business has been good: driven by expense reductions and record industry-wide occupancy levels, Forest City’s net operating income grew 10% in the first quarter.
Even better, says Jason Wolf, co-managerof the Third Avenue Real Estate Fund, Forest City has “de-risked its strategy considerably.” It has sold non-core assets and reduced net debt to EBITDA from 13x in 2011 to 9x, a ratio likely to reach 7-8x over the next year or two. The debt makeup has improved, with mostly nonrecourse fixed-rate mortgages with 4% average interest rates. Its ratio of development assets to total assets has decreased from 20% pre-crisis to around 8% today.
With a focus on core markets, Forest City is now poised for growth. Wolf’s co-manager, Ryan Dobratz, expects its funds from operations (FFO) to increase 7-8% annually, driven by improving economics at operating properties, further cost cuts and the lower-risk monetization of its pipeline that comes from building out already established developments.
THE BOTTOM LINE
The market isn’t giving the company adequate credit for having “de-risked” its strategy in
recent years, says Jason Wolf, by selling non-core assets, cutting debt and focusing on
more mature developments. Using peer cap rates on operating assets and private-market
values on development assets, he pegs the company’s net asset value in the mid-$30s.
Despite all this, Dobratz says Forest City’s shares trade at their biggest discount to net asset value (outside of the financial crisis) in 20 years. Using peer cap rates of 5.6% on operating assets and valuing development assets based on private-market transactions, he pegs the company’s NAV in the mid-$30s. The large discount and today’s wide spread of spot cap rates over Treasury-bond rates, he adds, should provide some cushion if interest rates rise.
Two catalysts could drive new demand for the stock. As tax loss carryforwards burn off, Dobratz expects the company’s dividend to grow at nearly twice the growth in FFO, attracting yield-hungry investors. In addition, in September, real estate will become its own sector in the S&P and MSCI indices. Dobratz believes this will highlight equity funds’ systematic underweighting of real estate, which he estimates, if corrected, could bring $130 billion in fresh capital to the $1 trillion U.S. equity-REIT market. “Forest City has changed so much for the better,” he says, “maybe having an expanded audience will help recognize that.”

				The Trust has adopted reasonable policies and procedures designed to prevent selective disclosure of the Funds’ portfolio holdings to third parties. Each Fund discloses its top ten portfolio holdings on a monthly basis approximately fifteen (15) business days after month end by posting the information on the Trust website. Each Fund also discloses its portfolio holdings on a quarterly basis in reports to shareholders and via SEC filings within sixty (60) days after quarter end. Other disclosures of portfolio holdings may only be made when the Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer determines that the disclosures are for a legitimate business purpose (such as to service providers or broker-dealers in connection with the performance of services for the Funds) and that the recipient is made aware that the information provided is strictly confidential and that they may not trade in securities based on non-public information that may be included in the disclosures. The Trustees periodically review Fund portfolio holdings disclosures and their recipients as part of their overall review processes. Service providers that are currently authorized for disclosure of information are the Trust’s Adviser, Distributor, Transfer Agent, Custodian(s), Auditors, Accountants, Counsel and each of their respective affiliates and advisers. Any additional parties to whom portfolio holdings information is disclosed will be reported to the Board of Trustees. The Trust’s policies and procedures prohibit any person or entity from receiving compensation or consideration of any kind in connection with any disclosures of portfolio holdings. The Trust believes that the foregoing procedures substantially eliminate the likelihood of conflicts between the interests of shareholders and affiliates of the Trust.
			 
				Third Avenue Management (“TAM”) has developed a Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) outlining the processes that will be implemented in response to events that significantly disrupt our business. The timing and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, so we will be flexible in responding to events as they occur.
If you are not able to contact TAM as you normally would after a significant business disruption, please visit our website at www.thirdave.com for contact information.
TAM plans to resume business operations as quickly as possible after a significant business disruption. TAM’s BCP includes, among other procedures, instructions regarding the following: safeguarding TAM employees and TAM property, protecting TAM’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business.
TAM’s BCP addresses data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.
Significant business disruptions can vary in scope (i.e. only TAM, a single building housing TAM, the business district where TAM is located, etc.) The severity of disruptions can also vary from minimal to severe. The plan developed by TAM addresses all potential disruptions and we are confident that it will help us to resume business as soon as possible following a significant business disruption. If a disruption is so severe that it prevents TAM from remaining in business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and securities.
