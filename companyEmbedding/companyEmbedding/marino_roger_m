Act Two-  Roger Marino (part one)


							By Andrew Rimas |
Boston Magazine |

November 2003
 








 







 
 

The limousines won't spill their pampered contents for another two hours, but a battery of cameras has already begun its siege. It's late afternoon in the no man's land outside the red carpet of Manhattan's Sam S. Shubert Theatre. As in any scene of plotted hoopla, the crowd is as self-propagating as a virus. Celebrities draw photographers, flashbulbs draw tourists, gawkers validate the celebrities. Thickets of tripods jostle above the media fence, while grunts in bulging safari vests calibrate television cameras. Every lens is focused on the theater door. In brilliant electricity, the words “Bernadette Peters” and “Gypsy” sear through the high-rise shadows. It's opening night on Broadway.
 “This is probably a stupid question,” a woman asks the cashier inside the box office, “but you wouldn't have any tickets left, would you?” It is, indeed, a stupid question. Tickets have been held for names that have long since been burned into the public retina. Kate Winslet and Mia Farrow. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane. Susan Lucci. Joel Grey. Even — reverent pause — Tom Hanks.
   Opening night is for People, with a scrolling, Corinthian capital “P.” People like Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, who shakes and greets his way down the aisle, mobbed by suppliant hands. Or New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has proclaimed “Curtain Up on Gypsy Day” in New York. People with names and influence. With glamour.   As the lights draw out the sparkle and noise of the opening act, and Bernadette Peters strides from the darkness with the cry, “Sing out, Louise!,” the man clapping hardest is also one of the least likely to be there, almost as incongruous as the floral midwesterners populating the balcony. He is, in fact, a 65-year-old electronics engineer from Revere, a grandfatherly computer nerd — albeit one with the healthy coloring and firm handshake that come from lots of golf and holidays in Tuscany. He is giddy with excitement. And he is sitting improbably close to Tom Hanks. This is because he is Roger Marino, a founder of (and the “M” in) the multibillion-dollar Massachusetts computer giant EMC. He is also one of the producers of the show.
   Any Broadway producer on the flip side of Max Bialystock is filthy rich, and Marino is among the richest. Ten years after he retired from it, Hopkinton-based EMC remains the biggest shark in the yawning deeps of an industry — data storage — that most people don't understand, assuming they even know it exists. It's Massachusetts' most valuable company: Its market capitalization passed Gillette's way back in 1999. And though few people in Dedham, where he now lives, could probably readily identify him, Marino has been dubbed a “demibillionaire” with a net worth once estimated at as much as $1.2 billion. That was, admittedly, during the technology boom, but his current bank balance is nonetheless reliably muttered to still be in the hundreds of millions.
   One day, he was lying by the pool, talking to his broker on the phone. “Buy,” he would say. And “Sell.” After a while, it occurred to him to question whether this was a useful thing to do. “I don't think so,” Marino says. “What a bunch of bullshit that is. You might as well become a lawyer.” It was time for reinvention. And so began the tale of the rich man who could buy just about anything and decided to go Hollywood.
   Marino became an executive producer of movies, including the upcoming I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and an adaptation of John Irving's novel A Widow for One Year, called The Door in the Floor. He bought, and later sold, the Pittsburgh Penguins. He tried to buy the Red Sox. He invested in a Broadway show.
   Of course, these are expensive hobbies. Hockey teams may be playthings, but they're playthings for a rarefied income bracket, and while paupers often meddle in theater production, few will ever boast a Bernadette Peters. Marino jokingly told a Boston Globe reporter that he left sports after dropping $40 million on the Penguins and went into the movie business “because I hear you can lose a lot of money doing that.” He is said to have since spent at least another $40 million on his films.   Other rich executives have traded cash for big-screen credits. Federal Express founder Fred Smith, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, and eBay cofounder Jeff Skoll have all produced films. Some have even made a killing at it. Gateway computer cofounder Norm Waitt Jr. bankrolled My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
   But Marino is different: He also wants to direct. He's “a lot more than just your average guy with a lot of money,” says Michael Corrente, 44, Marino's partner in Revere Pictures, a fledgling movie production outfit that the two formed two years ago. “He's very, very well versed and literate in the world of cinema.” Indeed he is. Few Fortune 500 executives would cite the 1958 Richard Burton drama Look Back in Anger as a profound influence. Nor does Marino need much prompting to trumpet the beauties of cinema arcana. He lists Bryan Forbes's The L-Shaped Room, Tony Richardson's The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, and Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life as celluloid masterpieces, and he has a taste for subtitles. “I first started liking French cinema when I was a kid because of the sex,” he says. “Then I started appreciating the art.”
   In addition to I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and The Door in the Floor, Marino's Revere Pictures — named for his hometown — is about to release a thriller called Corn and a flick for young adults, When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, based on a book of the same name. 
   That's for the future, though. As the curtain comes down at the Shubert Theatre, the night bubbles with camera strobes and Champagne, with cheek-kissing and self-congratulation. In the center of it stands Roger Marino, snug in the coils of celebrity. 
   How Marino ended up there is a story not unlike a Broadway rags-to-sequins fable. His father was a self-educated tailor who took the boat from Naples in 1915, then slept in doorways before getting work in a shop within the shadow of the elevated Orange Line on Forsyth Street, next to Northeastern University. (The younger Marino would one day plant the family name on a futuristic $12 million recreation center, to which he and his wife gave $5.5 million.) The old man worked hard and crossed the water to Revere, where he and his family lived a relatively comfortable existence. 
 “I didn't grow up poor,” says Marino, who still speaks with the hammered vowels and street consonants of the North Shore. “It wasn't a bad neighborhood at all. I took the trolley to the beach.” And to less sweaty diversions. “My father took me to operas when I was a kid,” he says. “Puccini and Joe Green. Giuseppe Verdi. I grew up with opera in the house.” More significantly, he became a regular visitor to the Revere Theater. “Twelve cents for two movies and a serial,” he remembers.
   Marino went through the expected motions of a sepia-tinged childhood. One set of relatives in the walkup above, another in the apartment below. Sandlot baseball, sandlot football, street basketball. (Every game, apparently, except hockey.) He worked on one of the town's two remaining farms and even walked behind a horse once or twice. “Not plowing,” he says, “but turning up the dirt to air it out.”
   After graduating from Revere High School, Marino carpooled to Northeastern with three or four of the neighborhood boys, and earned himself a degree in electrical engineering. “Electrical, not electronic,” he stresses, although he worked as an electronics engineer after he graduated. This led, naturally enough, toward breakneck thrills in the exciting world of early computer development.
 “From the early '60s on, Boston became more technical,” Marino says. “There was no need for travel outside. I stayed    in Boston my whole career.” By 1964 he had a wife, Janice Lundgren, and two daughters. (They would later divorce; Marino remarried and had three more children, including a set of twins.)
   But Marino found that engineering, whatever its glories, lacked vim. “There wasn't enough action. I went into marketing, and then I went to smaller companies to get closer to the action.” He stuck his foot into startup ventures.
   Newton, of course, had something to say about actions and their opposites, and for every push to the heavens, the unwashed hand of reality comes crashing down with all the bludgeoning malice of the cosmos. “I started a couple of failures,” says Marino. And then, just when it seemed that the natural state of an object ought to be at rest, he found movement. In 1979, Marino and a Northeastern friend, Dick Egan, founded EMC. This company would become a winner, changing both their lives, reshaping an industry, and becoming one of Massachusetts' biggest employers.
 “We started off as manufacturers' reps, selling, peddling on the street,” says Bob Blanding, the third person to join EMC and now CEO of Technical Applications Associates. “EMC started on a card table. The current Mrs. Marino was our rent-a-secretary. I remember the typewriter    sitting there on that rickety card table, and Michelle Marino — St. Pierre, at the time — typing away.”
   Any fledgling business is less a walk in the park than a stroll through a minefield crammed with alligators. EMC's early years proved no exception. “It was hard work,” says Greg Strakosch, who worked under Marino during the 1980s, and who is now the CEO of TechTarget, a media company specializing in information technology. “We were selling a very unsexy product: computer memory and disk drives. And we were competing against IBM, which had a 98 percent market share. We were fighting Goliath.”
   Unlike the technology firms that would one day self-immolate on pyres of torched IPOs, EMC survived by blending rock-skulled business sense with something rare in the high-tech milieu: frugality. Nor was the vigor of its staff a handicap. “I hired guys I liked,” Marino says. “I like smart people. I like athletes. These guys that worked for me were smart athletes, and they went out and killed.”
 “Roger is one of the best salesmen I ever knew,” says Blanding, who left EMC in 1984. “He got our first order.” It was for computer desks, furniture being EMC's first line of product before it became a manufacturer. “Roger said, 'We'll just bring the order right up to the customer.' About 10 minutes before we were ready to leave, Roger said, 'I'm tied up. You're going to have to take that in yourself.' I took it in. There was construction, and I had to drag these large computer desks down the sidewalk and up two flights of stairs to his customer. And he did forget to say thank you.”
 “I found that it was not a good idea to go out to lunch,” says Annie Tulley, who joined EMC as its fourth employee and left in 1981, “because they would have sold my desk. It was probably the best job I ever had in my life, though. You were never bored.”
   The ghost of Horatio Alger, or perhaps of Gordon Gekko, walked EMC through those early years. By 1987 the company had swelled into a full-blooded giant. Hiccups did occur — “events,” as Marino calls them (“burning crashes that almost kill people”). In 1988 and 1989, for example, EMC lost $50 million because of contaminated disk drives it bought from Japanese manufacturer NEC. “We had a war chest of about $50 million in the bank. If we didn't have that, we'd have been dead.” Even today Marino waxes sarcastic about “Japanese reliability.”
   But by 1992 he was able to retire, his fortune padlocked tight. Marino then faced what has been termed the Conundrum of the Lucky Bastard: What does a healthy man in the prime of life do with his pile?

Roger M. Marino, E'61,H'96
Hailing from a modest background, Roger Marino learned the value of hard work early in life—his father worked as a tailor in a factory that was a stone’s throw from the Northeastern campus. When Roger arrived at Northeastern in 1956 as an engineering student, he quickly made the most of the opportunities afforded him and earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering.
Following his graduation in 1961, Roger worked as a circuit designer at RCA Storage Systems in Burlington, Massachusetts. After leaving RCA, he became a salesman for a memory products company. All the while that Roger worked for other companies, honing his technical and management skills, he dreamed of starting his own business.
In 1979, Roger made that dream come true. Along with his former classmate, Richard J. Egan, E’61, H’95, he co-founded EMC Corporation, now a $17 billion company that designs and manufactures computer storage products. The Fortune 500 firm rapidly became one of the largest and most successful companies in the industry, and is now a global leader in sophisticated information storage. 
Always seeking new challenges, Roger retired from EMC in 1992 to pursue a number of business ventures related to his lifelong interest in sports and recreation. He was the chair and chief financial officer of Golf Technologies, Inc., in Natick, Massachusetts, which develops technology products for golf enthusiasts. He is also the former principal owner of the Worcester Ice Cats, a professional minor-league hockey team, and the Pittsburgh Penguins, a National Hockey League team.

Roger has always maintained close ties with Northeastern, serving as a university trustee from 1996 to 2008 and as a trustee emeritus beginning in 2009. In 2011, he was appointed to lead the emeriti community at the university, and lends his keen insights and business acumen to this important group of Northeastern ambassadors.
Throughout the years, Roger has been dedicated to numerous initiatives across the Northeastern campus. While a trustee, he and his family pledged a generous gift supporting the cost of building the iconic and state-of-the-art Marino Recreation Center. Upon its opening in 1996, the facility became the university’s signature building on Huntington Avenue and remains a popular destination for members of the university community.  
Deeply committed to education, Roger supports the Torch Scholars Program, a Northeastern initiative for students who have risen above exceptional odds and who demonstrate the potential to excel. He additionally endows two annual scholarships at Revere High School, co-founded the Summit Montessori School in Framingham, Massachusetts, and is a trustee at the Belmont Hill School in Belmont, Massachusetts. 
With a great affinity for the arts, Roger has produced five feature films including Ciao America, The Door in the Floor, I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead and When Zachary Beaver Came to Town. He also produced the acclaimed Broadway revival of Gypsy, starring Bernadette Peters, who was nominated for a Tony Award for her role as Mama Rose. An artist in his own right, Roger’s work was displayed at Northeastern’s Gallery 360 in 2010. 
Roger, who resides in the Greater Boston area, has two sons and three daughters.

President's Welcome

Roger M. Marino, E'61, H'96
EARLY INFLUENCES
On growing up in a triple-decker on Boston’s North Shore:  “I grew up in Revere, Massachusetts, at 21 North Avenue and I lived in the middle floor of a three-floor building. My grandmother and grandfather and a couple of their kids lived on the bottom floor, and a couple of their kids lived on the top floor.”  

As a child in Revere, Massachusetts.

On his father immigrating to America from Italy in the early twentieth century: "My father came from Naples, Italy, in 1915; he was 17 years old. He claimed that in the first couple of weeks he lived in doorways in Boston, because he couldn’t find a place to eat and sleep. So he had to get a job."
On his father being his greatest inspiration: “He has always been my hero. He was a hard worker. He was very studious. He read a lot. He read a lot of poetry. He was an art appreciator in that he had poems and artwork, and he loved opera." 
 

Roger Marino and his father, Anthony, on a Sunday morning in 1946. 

NORTHEASTERN REFLECTIONS
On why he studied engineering at Northeastern: "I was really interested in science. I loved science when I was high school. In fact, I have a scholarship dedicated to one of my science teachers from high school at Revere High, Peter Cerasoli." 
On how co-op made his Northeastern education possible: “Co-op is key. My father paid for my first two tuition bills which were $300 each per term. And I paid from there on in. They did supply me with room-and-board, because I commuted in a Volkswagen every day to school.”
 On launching EMC with fellow Trustee Richard Egan, E’61, H’95: “I got a phone call from Dick Egan saying, ‘I would like to meet at the Marriott in Newton.’ That’s where all good businesses meet, central location. We met one night and he said, ‘Listen, you’ve been in a few companies. I’ve been in a few companies. Some have gone out of business. Let’s start our own company and if it goes out of business, it’s our fault.’”
 

Roger Marino and Richard Egan (center) with President Joseph E. Aoun. 

 
PHILANTHROPY AND GIVING BACK
On the importance of giving back: “It’s because I think you have to give back. I give back in two areas, health and education. And I work with Revere High and I give scholarships there, and I work with Northeastern and I enjoyed Northeastern.’”

Roger Marino with Torch Scholars. 

On why he supports the Torch Scholars program: “I had a talk with Richard Freeland a while ago, and I sat down and said, ‘You know this university is getting so popular and so good, people like me can’t come here anymore.’ And you have heard that a thousand times since then.”
CAMPUS TRANSFORMATION AND GREAT MOMENTUM
On how much it means that the Marino Center was built close to where his father worked in a factory: “I said that in the groundbreaking speech, and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house when I said it. It’s pretty touching that you can build a building where your father used to work in a factory.”

Singing a beam during the Marino Center construction.

On his first visits to the iconic Marino Recreation Center: “I was impressed. It, of course, bowled me over when I saw it in person. I will tell you when I really was bowled over—when I saw it at night, all lit up against the Boston background. That was just amazing. That’s when it was really pretty.”

The Marino Center at night.

On Northeastern's physical transformation since the late 1950s: “When I was coming here, I never got lost. When I come here now, I get lost. That’s really kind of an overview of what the difference is. I’ve taken pictures on my iPhone now of various parts of Northeastern that show how pretty it is. I want to show it to people."

Roger Marino visiting the Marino Center. 

On Northeastern's great progress and momentum: “I think the progress that I have seen through my years has just been spectacular. It would take a book to describe the type of progress that was made here through all of its presidents. I am really happy to see that this president (Joseph Aoun) can take it to another level, which I thought was impossible. And he is doing it.”

President Aoun and Roger Marino.

Biography
Hailing from a modest background, Roger Marino learned the value of hard work early in life—his father worked as a tailor in a factory that was a stone’s throw from the Northeastern campus. When Roger arrived at Northeastern in 1956 as an engineering student, he quickly made the most of the opportunities afforded him and earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
