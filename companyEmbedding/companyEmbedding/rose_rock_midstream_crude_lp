Rose Rock


Rose Rock Midstream specializes in crude oil gathering, transportation, storage and marketing in some of the best resource plays in North America. 
 
We serve areas that are experiencing strong production growth and drilling activity through our exposure to the: 



Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana;
Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin and the Niobrara Shale in the Rocky Mountain region;
Eagle Ford Formation, Granite Wash and Mississippian oil trend in the Mid-Continent region; and
Utica Basin in Ohio.

We own and operate a network of more than 1,800 miles of crude oil pipelines and 10.3 million barrels of crude storage. The majority of our assets are strategically located in or connected to the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil marketing hub, the designated point of delivery specified in all NYMEX crude oil futures contracts and one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the United States. 
 
Our midstream services are further extended with our Field Services trucking division. Our fleet of more than 225 transport trucks follow the drilling, acting as mobile extensions of our operations. Together, our assets offer the connectivity and flexibility needed to support the growing demand for midstream services throughout the U.S.

 







David Minielly
Vice President
 
Dave Minielly serves as vice president of Rose Rock Midstream. Dave is responsible for overseeing all of the company’s field and pipeline operations as well as asset integrity and supply chain management.
