	Juniper Pharmaceuticals Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial and Operating Results




	Revenue from Core Business Increased 17% Year-over-Year




	CRINONE

	®

	Revenues Increased 22% and Juniper Pharma Services Revenues Rose 25% in
	Local Currency Compared to First Quarter of 2016



	BOSTON, May 4, 2017  Juniper Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:JNP), a womens
	health therapeutics company, today announced financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents were $21.8 million at March 31, 2017, a 4% increase from December 31, 2016.


	We continue to execute on our strategy to leverage our solid financial position and grow the core business. The Company maintains a fiscally disciplined
	approach to developing our portfolio of differentiated therapeutics that address unmet and underserved medical needs in womens health, said Alicia Secor, Chief Executive Officer.


	We expect to be in a position to file up to three INDs with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2018, pending completion of

	IND-enabling

	activities for each program. Our strong balance sheet ensures that we will have sufficient capital to fund operations and development through achievement of these planned milestones, added
	Ms. Secor.


	The Company plans to prioritize development of its portfolio and may also seek partnerships to support the advancement of one or more of
	its product candidates through

	non-dilutive

	financing. In addition, the Company continues to explore external opportunities to expand its existing product pipeline and pursue additional partnerships.


	Advancements on lead formulations for the Companys pipeline of intravaginal ring (IVR) candidates continue on track for the following:


	 




	 


	


	 



	JNP-0101

	(oxybutynin IVR) for overactive bladder;










	 


	


	 



	JNP-0201

	(estradiol + natural progesterone IVR) for symptoms of menopause; and




	 




	 


	


	 



	JNP-0301

	(natural progesterone IVR) for the prevention of

	pre-term

	birth (PTB) in women with a short cervical length at

	mid-pregnancy.





	This first quarter of 2017 was marked by the continued growth of our core
	business, said Jeff Young, Chief Financial Officer at Juniper. CRINONE product revenues were up 22%, and revenues from Juniper Pharma Services increased 25% on a local currency basis, compared to the first
	quarter of 2016. We are in a strong financial position to achieve our objectives.



	First Quarter Financial Results



	First quarter total revenues increased 7% to $11.2 million, compared with $10.5 million for the quarter ended March 31,
	2016. First quarter 2016 revenues include $0.9 million of royalty revenue from Allergan. Following the monetization of the Allergan royalty stream in November 2016, Juniper no longer records royalty revenue from Allergan.


	Product revenues were $7.7 million, an increase of 22%, driven by continued

	in-market

	growth and new market sales
	of CRINONE

	®

	(progesterone gel) by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.


	Service revenues from
	Juniper Pharma Services were $3.5 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 8%, versus the first quarter of last year, driven by new and existing customer growth.


	Gross profit increased to $4.7 million as compared to $4.1 million in the prior year quarter.


	Total operating expenses were $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.3 million increase as compared to the prior year quarter.


	Juniper recorded a net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of
	$1.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the same period of 2016.







	Liquidity



	Cash and cash equivalents were $21.8 million as of March 31, 2017, versus $21.0 million at December 31, 2016.



	Board and Committee Composition Matters



	Juniper also
	announced today that Frank Condella will not seek

	re-election

	to the Companys Board of Directors at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting, as a result of which his term in office
	will expire upon completion of the meeting.


	Ms. Secor added, We want to thank Frank for his years of service to Juniper
	and his commitment to the vision of the Company. We wish him well in his future endeavors.


	In addition, the Company announced a
	change to its audit committee composition, with Ann Merrifield assuming Dr. Frank Armstrongs place on the committee, effective upon completion of the upcoming annual shareholder meeting.

	Forward Looking Statements




	This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
	1995, including statements relating to anticipated future financial performance; the number and timing of Investigational New Drug (IND) application filings and potential clinical trials for Junipers product candidates and the
	announcement of results from these trials; the potential of Junipers Intravaginal Ring (IVR) technology to improve the delivery of therapeutics to women; Junipers ability to leverage the 505(b)(2) pathway
	for product candidates; Junipers ability to complete business development transactions, including new product acquisitions and/or new collaborations regarding Junipers IVR technology; and, the expectation that the core
	operating business will enable targeted product development investments. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
	uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks associated with the drug
	development process generally, including the timely completion of prototype development and planned

	IND-enabling

	and sheep studies; risks associated with the outcomes of the prototype formulation development
	efforts and planned

	IND-enabling

	and sheep studies and whether they support further development of our product candidates; risks associated with the regulatory review process, including the risk that the FDA
	does not ultimately accept our proposed clinical program for

	JNP-0301;

	the risk that the results of previously conducted studies involving our product candidates will not be repeated or observed in ongoing or
	future studies or








	following commercial launch, if such product candidates are approved; risks associated with obtaining, maintaining and protecting intellectual property; risks associated with Juniper
	Pharmaceuticals ability to enforce its patents against infringers and defend its patent portfolio against challenges from third parties; the risk of competition from currently approved therapies and from other companies developing products for
	similar uses; risks associated with Juniper Pharmaceuticals ability to manage operating expenses and/or obtain additional funding to support its business activities; and risks associated with Juniper Pharmaceuticals dependence on
	third parties. For a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties associated with Juniper Pharmaceuticals forward-looking statements, please review the Companys reports filed with the SEC, including, but not limited
	to, its Annual Report on Form

	10-K and

	subsequent filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which

Columbia Laboratories Begins Trading as Juniper Pharmaceuticals (JNP)

		  -- Company Updates on Q1 Revenue --
		

Apr 13, 2015, 07:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Columbia Laboratories, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BOSTON, April 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Effective this morning, Columbia Laboratories, Inc. is now Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:   JNP) ("the Company"), and its Nottingham, UK based subsidiary Molecular Profiles, Ltd., is now Juniper Pharma Services. The Company's common stock will begin trading today under the symbol JNP on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
"The single Juniper brand formalizes the experience and capabilities we have built across our CRINONE® franchise, service business, and proprietary product development programs," said Frank Condella, CEO of Juniper Pharmaceuticals. "The integration of Juniper Pharma Services has provided critical in-house drug development expertise, as well as supply chain management for CRINONE®, while also generating cash-flow to advance our proprietary drug programs."
The specialty pharmaceutical company has adopted a new logo with an icon featuring two interlocked rings. The icon symbolizes the synergy between Juniper Pharma Services capabilities and the Company's women's health focused pipeline.  
Additionally, a new corporate website reflecting the Juniper brand identity has been launched at www.juniperpharma.com.
Separately, the Company announced that revenues for the first quarter of 2015 are expected to exceed the prior year first quarter by more than 15%. The growth is driven by an increase in CRINONE® (progesterone gel) shipments, combined with the growth of the service business in local currency. The first quarter of 2015 will also include R&D spending associated with drug development activities discussed below. The Company is maintaining its full year guidance of low double-digit revenue growth. 
The Company's value creation strategy is to support the continued growth of the CRINONE® franchise by its partners Merck Serono and Actavis, expand and maintain a profitable service business by providing unique pharmaceutical development capabilities to global pharmaceutical customers, and invest operating cash flow into a proprietary product pipeline to build long-term shareholder value.  
Recent pipeline developments include an Investigational New Drug filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COL-1077, a 10% lidocaine bioadhesive gel intended as an acute anesthetic for use in women undergoing transvaginal pipelle-directed endometrial biopsy. A Phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study that will enroll 150 patients at fifteen U.S. sites will be initiated later this quarter. 
Furthermore, the Company recently licensed worldwide exclusive rights to a proprietary intra-vaginal ring technology (IVR) developed by renowned scientists Dr. Robert Langer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. William Crowley from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The IVR technology enables the delivery of one or more pharmaceuticals at different dosages and release rates in a single segmented ring. This patient administered-device will be utilized as a key drug delivery platform for Juniper's emerging proprietary product pipeline. 
Drs. Langer and Crowley are also serving as strategic scientific advisors to help guide Juniper's R&D initiatives and drug development strategy.

Women represent over 50% of the US population, yet treatment options for common conditions beyond contraception are limited," Ms. Secor continued. "We aim to address conditions such as menopausal symptoms, overactive bladder, and preterm birth, but also to remove the stigma and inspire the conversations that will foster a vibrant community of healthy, empowered women."JNP-0301 for Preterm Birth Prevention In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company held a constructive pre-IND meeting with the FDA for JNP-0301, its natural progesterone IVR in development for the prevention of preterm birth (PTB) in women with a short cervical length at mid-pregnancy (SCL).  In the U.S. alone, the prevalence of women at risk for PTB due to SCL (defined as <</span>25 mm) is estimated to be around 400,000. The incidence of this condition is expected to rise as more physicians adopt the current medical guidelines to screen for SCL in all pregnant women.  There is currently no FDA-approved drug to prolong gestation in this patient population."We look forward to further dialogue with the Agency as we advance our IND-enabling work and seek to finalize the clinical program design for JNP-0301," noted Dr. Bridget Martell, Juniper's Chief Medical Officer.Prototype testing is underway, and benefits from the concurrent work being done on JNP-0201.  Juniper expects to conduct IND-enabling studies with JNP-0301 in 2017 and to initiate definitive sheep studies by year-end 2017 which, among other planned activities, are expected to enable an IND submission in the first half of 2018 for JNP-0301.With 15 million babies born before 37 weeks gestation around the world each year, and 1.1 million deaths annually due to complications of preterm birth, Juniper will also seek scientific and regulatory input in other geographies to support development to meet the global unmet need.JNP-0201: Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for MenopausePrototype testing is also underway for JNP-0201, which employs the multi-segmented capability of the Juniper IVR for HRT to deliver natural estrogen and progesterone to alleviate symptoms of menopause in women.  An estimated 45 million women are either menopausal or approaching menopause in U.S. alone. The domestic market was valued at over $4 billion in 2015, comprising both pharmacy-compounded and FDA-approved therapies for HRT.Read MoreThe Company will focus on IND-enabling activities for JNP-0201, including a definitive sheep study to be initiated by year-end 2017.  An IND for JNP-0201 is also planned for the first half of 2018.JNP-0101 for Overactive Bladder (OAB)Building on preclinical data from a recently-completed pilot study in a sheep model, Juniper is refining the cGMP formulation of JNP-0101, its oxybutynin IVR for the treatment of OAB in women, to address the unique properties of this molecule.OAB is characterized by involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscles before the bladder is full. This chronic urological condition affects an estimated 20 million women in the U.S., with approximately nine million receiving pharmacologic therapy. The domestic market for OAB therapeutics was approximately $2.3 billion in 2015.Pursuing Multiple Strategic OpportunitiesIn addition to making investments in Juniper Pharma Services and measured development of the aforementioned IVR candidates, Juniper is actively exploring new strategic opportunities, including:Collaborations to apply the IVR technology platform and technical expertise in polymer science with other companies' therapeutic agents;Partnerships for internally-developed candidates;Pipeline expansion through in-licensing or acquisition of externally-developed women's health therapeutics."Business development is a key strategic focus for 2017. While advancing our pipeline internally, we intend to leverage our many assets and maintain optionality for our programs to maximize value for shareholders," Ms. Secor concluded.About Juniper PharmaceuticalsJuniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is focused on developing therapeutics that address unmet medical needs in women's health. The Company is advancing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates that leverage its differentiated intravaginal ring technology and when appropriate the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.

(JNP) ("Juniper" or the "Company"), a women's health therapeutics company, today announced financial and other results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016. Recent highlights include:Product and service revenue increased 15% and 24%, respectively, versus the second quarter of 2015;Balance sheet remains strong;Crinone® (progesterone gel) approved in Japan under the brand OneCrinone®;Completed enrollment of Phase 2b trial of COL-1077 10% lidocaine vaginal gel in women undergoing a minimally invasive pipelle-directed endometrial biopsy;Two Phase 1 studies of COL-1077 published in the international peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Pharmacology in Drug Development;Phase 1 proof-of-concept study demonstrating the ability of Juniper's intravaginal ring to successfully deliver the nine amino acid peptide leuprolide published in the influential peer-reviewed Journal of Controlled Release; and,Alicia Secor appointed President and CEO, and a director of the Company. Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRNewsFoto/Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)More"I am very excited to join the Company, and congratulate the team on a strong second quarter," said Alicia Secor, Juniper's President and CEO.  "I look forward to building on this momentum as we work to transform Juniper into a leading, global, women's health company.""Strong growth of the ex-U.S. Crinone franchise and Juniper Pharma Services drove revenue up 16% to $11.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year," said George O. Elston, Juniper's Chief Financial Officer.  "This solid year-to-date performance has enabled us to maintain a stable, healthy cash position while advancing our proprietary R&D programs.""We are uniquely positioned to leverage our world-class service and platform capabilities to develop and commercialize important new therapeutics for women," Ms. Secor continued. "I look forward to advancing our current product candidates and expanding our portfolio to fulfill our mission to deliver value-added treatments that meet the unique and underserved healthcare needs of women."The Company continues to expect to report top-line results of its recently-completed Phase 2b clinical trial of COL-1077 10% lidocaine bioadhesive vaginal gel this quarter and, assuming positive outcomes, to advance this candidate into Phase 3 in 2017.If successful, COL-1077 is expected to fill an unmet need for pain management in women undergoing minimally-invasive gynecologic procedures.  There are over seven million such procedures performed annually in the United States, with no standard of care for pre-treatment analgesia.Juniper's intravaginal ring ("IVR") programs continue to advance toward clinical development.  The most advanced IVR product candidate is JNP-0101, an oxybutynin IVR for the treatment of overactive bladder in women.  IND-enabling studies are underway including a study, defined in the Company's pre-IND meeting with the FDA, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNP-0101 in a representative animal model.The Company is accelerating the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC") and production scale-up for JNP-0101 beyond its existing in-house capacity to further develop the go-to-market formulation and commercial manufacturing process ahead of its IND filing, which is now expected in 2017.  This activity is intended to reduce CMC-related risks as JNP-0101 moves through clinical trials and toward commercialization in the $1.3 billion U.S. overactive bladder market.Second Quarter Financial ResultsSecond quarter total revenues increased 16% to $11.9 million, compared with $10.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  Product revenues were $7.6 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 15%, versus the second quarter of last year, driven by continued in-market growth and new market sales of Crinone® (progesterone gel) by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Service revenues from Juniper Pharma Services were $3.4 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 24%, versus the second quarter of last year, as we experienced continued strong growth in customer volume.  Royalty revenues, based on Allergan's sales of Crinone®, were essentially unchanged at $0.9 million.Read MoreGross profit increased to $5.4 million as compared with $4.6 million in the prior year quarter.Total operating expenses were $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2016, a $2.2 million increase as compared to the prior year quarter.Sales and marketing costs increased $0.1 million to $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting continued investment in the U.S. market by Juniper Pharma Services. The $1.4 million increase in R&D spending as compared to the prior year quarter was predominantly driven by costs associated with the Phase 2b clinical trial of COL-1077. R&D expense also includes preclinical development costs for the IVR pipeline product candidates: JNP-0101 (oxybutynin IVR), JNP-0201 (estradiol + progesterone IVR for symptoms of menopause), and JNP-0301 (progesterone IVR for the prevention of preterm birth).The $0.7 million increase in general and administrative costs as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily driven by the creation of an internal business development function that was not in place in 2015 along with costs associated with CEO succession and organizational growth.Juniper recorded a net loss of $1.7 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, in the same period of 2015.LiquidityCash and cash equivalents were $13.0 million as of June 30, 2016, versus $13.5 million at March 31, 2016 and $13.9 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of capital expenditures.  OutlookBased on year-to date revenues and expectations for the second half of the year, Juniper now anticipates full-year 2016 revenue growth in the low- to mid-teen percentage range over 2015 results.Conference CallAs previously announced, Juniper's management will hold a conference call to discuss financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, as follows:  Date:   Thursday, August 4, 2016     Time:   8:30 a.m. EDT     Dial-in numbers:   Toll free: (866) 374-4635 (U.S.), (855) 669-9657 (Canada), or International: (412) 902-4218     Webcast (live & archive):   www.juniperpharma.com, under 'Investors' or click here  The teleconference replay will be available at approximately one hour after completion through Thursday, August 11, 2016, at (877) 344-7529 (U.S.), (855) 669-9658 (Canada) or (412) 317-0088 (International).
