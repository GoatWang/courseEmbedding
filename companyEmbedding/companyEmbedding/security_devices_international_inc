Security Devices International, Inc. Key Developments

Security Devices International Inc. Enters Multi-Year Agreement to Supply Safariland with SDI's Patented Collapsible Head 4omm Projectiles
Jun 22 17
Security Devices International Inc. announced the signing of a multi-year agreement to provide its patented collapsible head blunt impact projectiles (BIPs) and collapsible head payload projectiles including OC (pepper spray), CS (tear gas), ML (marking liquid), MP (marking powder), MO (malodorant), IN (inert powder) and DNA (plant based DNA forensic marking rounds) to The Safariland Group (Safariland), headquartered in Jacksonville, FL. SDI will supply BIPs and payload projectiles to Safariland for integration with Safariland's proprietary propulsion system. These new rounds will be marketed under the Defense Technology brand name. The first shipment of rounds was made as of the date of this press release. SDI believes that this agreement with Safariland validates the more than five years of research and development that SDI has invested in the creation of the collapsible head 40mm round. SDI further believes that by working in partnership with Safariland, together the companies can reach a far larger market for the BIP than SDI would be able to reach on its own.


Security Devices International, Inc. announced delayed 10-Q filing
Apr 14 17
On 04/14/2017, Security Devices International, Inc. announced that they will be unable to file their next 10-Q by the deadline required by the SEC.


Security Devices International Inc. Enters into OEM Agreement with Mission Less Lethal
Mar 28 17
Security Devices International Inc. announced the signing of a multi-year OEM agreement with Mission Less Lethal (Mission). Under this agreement, SDI will be able to offer its customers a full line of .68 caliber chemical irritant projectiles and air-powered launchers produced by Mission Less Lethal. The .68 caliber launchers and projectiles are an important addition to SDI’s line of less lethal munitions. Currently, SDI’s product line, the Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP) leads the 40mm (high-kinetic) less lethal segment in range, accuracy, and most importantly safety. Capable of delivering over 200 joules of kinetic energy the BIP is designed to stop an assailant with a single shot (without causing permanent injury or death). Similarly, SDI’s extensive range of 12 gauge munitions including bean bags, rubber finned rockets, rubber balls and door breaching rounds provide law enforcement with a wide array of less lethal tools. Producing between 110-150 joules of energy these products offer a complete solution set in the mid-to-high kinetic segment. Now, the addition of a .68 caliber line of chemical irritant projectiles and launchers fills a critical gap in SDI’s offering by servicing the low kinetic impact segment. At only 15 joules of energy these systems rely more on the dispersion of chemical irritants than on impact energy. Together, these products give SDI, and their customer agencies, the most comprehensive range of less lethal solutions available.

By Grant Clauser 
This post was done in partnership with The Sweethome, a buyer's guide to the best things for your home. Read the full article here.
After 20 hours of research and a month spent testing six home security systems, we're confident that the LiveWatch Total Home + Video is the best self-installed wireless home security solution for most people. LiveWatch offers reliable equipment, fair monthly monitoring prices, and an innovative group-messaging system that can help protect your family and reduce the likelihood of false-alarm fines. LiveWatch also doesn't lock you into years of payments, unlike most security companies.










How we picked and testedWe narrowed down our list to six systems for testing. Here's some of the aftermath. Photo: Grant Clauser For this article, we considered only self-installed wireless security systems with continuous professional monitoring via a cellular connection. Professional monitoring means that someone is always available to respond to an alarm and can contact local emergency services for you if necessary. Most home insurance companies offer premium discounts for monitored alarm systems, but not for unmonitored ones. A cellular connection means the system can't be disabled by cutting your landline or cable connection. The control panel also needs a battery backup, so the system still works if your power goes out. We also looked for companies with short or no contracts, and without high cancellation fees. (A few newer companies are now offering pay-as-you-need systems without contracts. We didn't consider any for our main pick, but called in several as a possible alternate recommendation.) In addition to our testing, we sent a lengthy questionnaire to each vendor and asked about not only its technology, but also asked for such information as UL certifications and details about its user contracts and policies.We didn't consider any alarm systems that required professional installation, because a reader survey we conducted showed us that people are much more interested in DIY systems. Modern wireless security systems are easy to install, and professionally installed systems usually cost a lot more and have much more onerous contract terms. We also didn't test any of the thousands of local and regional alarm companies, because there are far too many to account for. The self-installed systems we tested should be available throughout the US.We called in six self-installed security systems and used them for four weeks, testing their control panels, motion sensors, contact sensors, sirens, cameras, and smartphone apps.Our pickLiveWatch offers short contracts with no early termination fees and includes a feature that lets your household group chat in the event of an alarm. Photo: Grant Clauser The LiveWatch Total Home + Video system offers the best combination of reliable equipment, comprehensive smart-home options, and flexible, no-contract professional-monitoring plans. In our tests, it proved easy for us to set up and dependable in operation. Its touchscreen control panel and smartphone app are simple to use, with its most important functions easily accessible from the main screen. You can expand the LiveWatch system to include security cameras, smart locks, garage door openers, and other Z-Wave devices. It also has a reasonable up-front price and monthly monitoring fee, which, when coupled with the lack of a lock-in contract, makes LiveWatch a safer investment than similar home security systems.One of LiveWatch's unique features is a system called ASAPer. When an alarm is triggered, it sends your family and emergency contacts a text message with a link to a text chat. Users can confirm the emergency or declare it a false alarm. This way, the person with the best knowledge of the situation (such as the person at home who accidentally tripped the system) can let everyone else know that things are fine (or that they're not fine). It's a nice feature, works fast, and should help put your family's mind at ease and reduce false alarms.A good budget optionSimpliSafe's equipment looks a bit clunky compared with LiveWatch's seeker touchscreen. Photo: Grant Clauser If you're looking for much cheaper monitoring without a contract, and you don't mind paying more up front for the equipment, we like SimpliSafe. It is easy to set up and doesn't require a contract, and its monthly monitoring is half the price of LiveWatch's. Unlike LiveWatch's system, SimpliSafe's system doesn't integrate with other home-automation or smart-home devices, and it doesn't have video cameras (yet). Still, the equipment and smartphone app, though basic, do their one job well. As with LiveWatch, you can cancel SimpliSafe's monitoring at any time, and then start up again later if your needs change—although both systems are effectively useless without monitoring if you're not at home.Setup, care, maintenance, and local feesMost security companies offer preconfigured starter packages, but those packages may not be enough to cover your whole house. But adding loads of sensors can drastically increase the initial price of the system, so don't rush to cover every square inch.You should have contact sensors (that trigger when opened) on every entrance door to your house, but you probably don't need them for every operable window. If there's no easy way into your second floor, for instance, you can probably skip sensors for those upstairs windows. You likely also don't need motion detectors in every room—one or two on the main floor are usually enough. Once you get a system, the company should let you put it in test mode to check for obvious holes.When you order your security system, the company should also let you know whether your municipality requires an alarm permit and should walk you through the steps to get one. Without one, you could face hefty false-alarm fees. You should also make sure you know how your local police department treats alarms from monitored security systems or reports from owners based on unmonitored systems. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness, or video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.Low batteries in sensors can trigger false alarms, and so can sensors that have fallen off the wall due to worn out double-sided tape. To avoid a visit from the police—and a fine—it's important that you test your sensors frequently to make sure they're still reporting to the system the way they're supposed to, and you should also give the devices a tug now and then to make sure they're secure.This guide may have been updated by The Sweethome. To see the current recommendation, please go here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
