	On January 10, 2017, JRjr33, Inc. (the “Company”) received notification (the “Deficiency Letter”) from the NYSE MKT LLC (the “NYSE MKT”) that it was not in compliance with certain NYSE MKT continued listing standards relating to stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2016. Specifically, the Deficiency Letter stated that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) (requiring stockholders’ equity of $2.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two its three most recent fiscal years), Section 1003(a)(ii) (requiring stockholders’ equity of $4.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years); and Section 1003(a)(iii) (requiring stockholders’ equity of $6.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years). The Deficiency Letter noted that the Company had a stockholders’ equity deficit of $(4,895,000) as of September 30, 2016, and has reported net losses in its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015.









	On April 18, 2017, the Company received a letter from the NYSE MKT (the “April 18 Letter”) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing of the report is a condition for the Company’s continued listing on the NYSE MKT as required by Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE Company Guide.









	On July 14, 2017, the Company received a letter from the NYSE MKT notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the “Form 10-Q”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing of the report is a condition for the Company’s continued listing on the NYSE MKT as required by Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE Company Guide.




	 




	Pursuant to the April 18 Letter the Company was required to submit a plan to the NYSE MKT by May 18, 2017 advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by October 17, 2017. The Company submitted its plan on May 18, 2017 (the “Plan”).




	 




	On July 14, 2017, the NYSE MKT notified the Company that it has reviewed the Plan and determined to accept the Plan and grant a Plan period through October 18, 2017.  NYSE Regulation Staff will review the Company periodically for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the Plan.  If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by October 18, 2017 or if the Company does not make progress consistent within the Plan period, NYSE Regulation staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.




	 




	The Company’s common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE MKT while it attempts to regain compliance with the listing standards noted, subject to the Company’s compliance with other continued listing requirements. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade under the symbol “JRJR,” but will have an added designation of “.BC” to indicate that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE MKT’s listing standards. The NYSE MKT notification does not affect the Company’s business operations or its Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements and does not conflict with or cause an event of default under any of the Company’s material agreements.




	 




	The Company issued a press release on July 20, 2017, announcing that it had received the notice of continued noncompliance and acceptance of the Plan. A copy of the press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

	The NYSE has reviewed the Company’s May 18, 2017 plan advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards and determined to accept the plan and grant a plan period extension through October 18, 2017. The Company intends to file the Form 10-Q as soon as reasonably practicable after completion of the audit.
