	WAVE Life Sciences Ltd.









	Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements


	 


	1. THE COMPANY


	Organization


	WAVE Life Sciences Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “WAVE,” “we” or the “Company”) is a genetic medicines company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for genetically defined diseases. We are initially developing oligonucleotides that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins.


	The Company was incorporated in Singapore on July 23, 2012 and has its principal U.S. office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Company was incorporated with the purpose of combining two commonly held companies, WAVE Life Sciences USA, Inc. (“WAVE USA”), a Delaware corporation (formerly Ontorii, Inc.), and WAVE Life Sciences Japan, Inc. (“WAVE Japan”), a company organized under the laws of Japan (formerly Chiralgen., Ltd.), which occurred on September 12, 2012. On May 31, 2016, WAVE Life Sciences Ireland Limited (“WAVE Ireland”) was formed as a wholly

	-

	owned subsidiary of WAVE Life Sciences Ltd. On April 3, 2017, WAVE Life Sciences UK Limited (“WAVE UK”) was formed as a wholly

	-

	owned subsidiary of WAVE Life Sciences Ltd. It was formed as a private company organized under the laws of England and Wales and the company number is 10705375.


	The Company’s primary activities since inception have been developing a synthetic chemistry drug development platform to design, develop and commercialize nucleic acid therapeutic programs, advancing the Company’s neurology franchise, expanding the Company’s research and development activities to enter the clinic, building the Company’s intellectual property, recruiting personnel and raising capital to support these activities.


	Risks and Uncertainties


	The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, developing internal manufacturing capabilities, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations and the need to obtain additional financing. The Company’s therapeutic programs will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization of any product candidates. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. The Company’s therapeutic programs are currently in the development or discovery stage. There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained, that any products developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval or that any approved products will be commercially viable. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees and consultants.


	Basis of Presentation


	The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in U.S. dollars.


	 


	 


	2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	The significant accounting policies described in the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the notes thereto, which are included in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 16, 2017, have had no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	Unaudited Interim Financial Data




	The accompanying interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, the related interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related interim information contained within the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and the notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The financial data and other


	7





	information disclosed in these notes related to the three months ended March 31, 2


	017 and 2016 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial positi


	on and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017 or any other interim perio


	d or future year or period.



	Principles of Consolidation


	The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	The recently issued accounting pronouncements described in the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the notes thereto, which are included in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017, have had no material changes during the three months ended March 31, 2017 except as described below.


	In November 2015, the

	Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)

	issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (“ASU 2015-17”),

	which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard resulted in the reclassification of short-term deferred tax assets to long-term deferred tax assets.


	 


	 


	3. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION


	The WAVE Life Sciences Ltd. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) authorizes the board of directors or a committee of the board to grant incentive share options, non-qualified share options, share appreciation rights and restricted share awards to eligible employees, outside directors and consultants of the Company. Options generally vest over periods of one to four years, and options that lapse or are forfeited are available to be granted again. The contractual life of all options is generally five or ten years from the grant date.


	As of March 31, 2017, 780,813 ordinary shares remained available for future grant under the 2014 Plan.


	The Company measures and records the value of options granted to non-employees over the period of time that services are provided and, as such, unvested portions are subject to re-measurement at subsequent reporting periods.

	4. PFIZER COLLABORATION AND SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT


	On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Research, License and Option Agreement (the “Pfizer Collaboration Agreement”) with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Pfizer agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of stereopure oligonucleotide therapeutics for up to five programs (the “Pfizer Programs”), each directed at a genetically-defined hepatic target selected by Pfizer (the “Collaboration”). The Company received $10.0 million as an upfront license fee under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement. Subject to option exercises by Pfizer, assuming five potential products are successfully developed and commercialized, the Company may earn up to $871.0 million in potential research, development and commercial milestone payments, plus royalties, tiered up to low double-digits, on sales of any products that may result from the Collaboration. None of the payments under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement are refundable.


	Simultaneously with the entry into the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Pfizer Equity Agreement,” and together with the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the “Pfizer Agreements”) with C.P. Pharmaceuticals International C.V., an affiliate of Pfizer (the “Pfizer Affiliate”). Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Equity Agreement, the Pfizer Affiliate purchased 1,875,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares (the “Shares”) at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $30.0 million. The Company did not incur any material costs in connection with the issuance of the Shares.


	Under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the parties agreed to collaborate during the four-year Research Term. During the Research Term, the Company is responsible to use its commercially reasonable efforts to advance up to five programs through to the selection of clinical candidates. At that stage, Pfizer may elect to license any of these Pfizer Programs exclusively and to have exclusive rights to undertake the clinical development of the resulting clinical candidates into products and the potential commercialization of any such products thereafter. In addition, the Company receives a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicenseable license to use Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology in any of the Company’s own hepatic programs that are outside the scope of the Collaboration (the “WAVE Programs”). If the Company uses this technology on the WAVE Programs, Pfizer is eligible to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments from the Company. Pfizer is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of any products that include Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology.




	Pfizer nominated two hepatic targets upon entry into the Collaboration in May 2016. In August 2016, Pfizer nominated the third hepatic target under the Collaboration and has the option to nominate two additional targets by November 5, 2017. The Collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee in which both parties are represented equally, which will oversee the scientific progression of each Pfizer Program up to the clinical candidate stage. During the four-year Research Term and for a period of two years thereafter,


	9





	the Company has agree


	d to work exclusively with Pfizer with respect to using any of the Company’s stereopure oligonucleotide technology that is specific for the applicable hepatic target which is the basis of any Pfizer Program.



	The stated term of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement commenced on May 5, 2016 and terminates, with respect to each Pfizer Program, on the date of the last to expire payment obligations and expires, with respect to each WAVE Program, on a program-by-program basis accordingly. Pfizer may terminate its rights related to a Pfizer Program under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement at its own convenience upon 90 days’ notice to the Company. The Company may also terminate its rights related to a WAVE Program at its own convenience upon 90 days’ notice to Pfizer. The Pfizer Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement by the other party.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recognized revenue of $0.7 million under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement

	. Deferred revenue amounted to $10.3 million

	 

	at March 31, 2017, of which $2.7 million is included in current liabilities.

	 


	 


	 


	5. NET LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE


	The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders, as its Series A preferred shares are participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to ordinary shareholders. However, for the periods presented, the two-class method does not impact the net loss per ordinary share as the Company was in a net loss position for each of the periods presented and holders of Series A preferred shares d

	o not participate in losses.



	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares used in computing net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders.


	The Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding share options to purchase ordinary shares and Series A preferred shares, are considered to be ordinary share equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.


	The following ordinary share equivalents, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

	6. INCOME TAXES


	The Company is a multi-national company subject to taxation in the United States, Japan, Ireland and Singapore. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded a tax provision of $1.3 million and a tax benefit of less than $0.1 million, respectively, the increase in the tax provision is a result of additional income earned in the United States under a contract research agreement between our U.S. and Singapore entities. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred in Japan, Ireland and Singapore, due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items.


	The Company’s reserves related to taxes and its accounting for uncertain tax positions are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more-likely-than-not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit.

	7. RELATED PARTIES



	The Company had the following related party transactions for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have not otherwise been discussed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements:

	The Company had cash of $127 thousand and $118 thousand at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, in depository accounts with Kagoshima Bank, Ltd., an affiliate of one of our shareholders,


	Kagoshima Shinsangyo Sousei Investment Limited Partnership


	.











	 





	•

	•






	In 2012, the Company entered into a consulting agreement for scientific advisory services with Dr. Gregory L. Verdine, one of our founders and the Chairman of our Board of Directors. The consulting agreement does not have a specific term and may be terminated by either party upon 14 days’ prior written notice. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, the Company pays Dr. Verdine approximately $13 thousand per month, plus reimbursement of certain expenses.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of


	Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

	Overview


	We are a genetic medicines company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for genetically defined diseases. Nucleic acid therapeutics are a growing and innovative class of drugs that have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. We are initially developing oligonucleotides that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins.




	The nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure. A stereopure oligonucleotide is comprised of molecules with atoms precisely arranged in three-dimensional orientations at each linkage. We believe controlling the position of the sulfur atom in the phosphorothioate (“PS”) moiety will optimize the pharmacological profile of our therapeutics by maximizing therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. The stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixture-based


	12





	nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in developme


	nt by others. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior pharmacologic properties as compared to mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. Our platform is designed to enable us to rationally


	design, optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics, which were previously thought to be too difficult to make and too expensive to manufacture. Further, our platform has the potential to design therapies that use any of the major molecular m


	echanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics, including antisense, ribonucleic acid interference (“RNAi”) splicing, and exon skipping.



	Our goal is to develop disease-modifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. We are focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. In addition to our current programs in development, we are also leveraging our platform to explore the next generation of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics that have the potential to selectively target certain cell types.


	Our core focus for our wholly-owned proprietary programs is neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the central nervous system (the “CNS”) and neuromuscular system. We expect to initiate six development programs by the end of 2018. These programs include our three most advanced programs, which are in Huntington’s disease (“HD”), and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), and three additional development candidates which we expect to select by the end of 2017. Further details regarding our programs are set forth below.






	 





	•






	In HD, we have two separate programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, each targeting a different disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”), within the


	huntingtin


	gene: rs362307 (“HTT SNP-1”) and rs362331 (“HTT SNP-2”). SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing production of a defective protein which causes disease. It has been shown that by targeting HTT SNP-1 or HTT SNP-2, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with HD can be reduced. We expect to initiate clinical development of both WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 in mid-2017.











	 





	•






	In DMD, we have developed WVE-210201, which targets exon 51, a region within the ribonucleic acid, (“RNA”), transcribed from the


	dystrophin


	gene. DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the


	dystrophin


	gene that results in dysfunctional dystrophin protein. We expect to initiate clinical development of WVE-210201 in the second half of 2017.











	 





	•






	In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Pfizer focused on the advancement of genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, bringing together our proprietary drug development platform, across antisense and single-stranded RNAi modalities, along with GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver. The collaboration seeks to leverage our stereochemistry platform across antisense and RNAi modalities and may incorporate GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will select, and we will advance, up to five targets from discovery through to the selection of clinical candidates, at which point Pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization. Two targets were declared upon initiation of the agreement, including Apolipoprotein C-III. In the third quarter of 2016, Pfizer nominated its third target. Per the terms of the agreement, Pfizer is entitled to nominate the remaining two targets by November 2017.







	We have never been profitable, and since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $21.0 million and $7.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $111.5 million and $90.5 million, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.



	Recent Developments



	On April 18, 2017, we closed a follow-on underwritten public offering of 4,166,667 ordinary shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million. 

	Net proceeds to us from the offering are expected to be approximately $93.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to further advance our three lead programs in HD and DMD; advance the development of our next three therapeutic candidates into the clinic; increase internal cGMP manufacturing capacity; support continued investment in the platform to drive the discovery and advancement of additional therapeutic candidates; and for general corporate purposes.

	Financial Operations Overview



	Revenue


	We have not generated any product revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Our revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2017 represents revenue earned under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement that we entered into in May 2016.


	Operating Expenses


	Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.


	Research and Development Expenses


	Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:






	 





	•






	employee salaries, benefits and other related costs, including share-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development organization;











	 





	•






	expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations (“CROs”) that conduct research and preclinical activities on our behalf, as well as contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical trials;











	 





	•






	costs of third-party consultants, including fees, share-based compensation and related travel expenses;











	 





	•






	the cost of sponsored research, which includes laboratory supplies and facility-related expenses, including rent, maintenance and other operating costs; and











	 





	•






	costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements.







	We recognize research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses.


	Our primary research and development focus since inception has been the development of our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform. We are using our platform to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of nucleic acid therapeutic candidates.


	Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of CROs, CMOs, consultants, and other external costs incurred in connection with our preclinical studies and regulatory fees. However, we do not allocate the cost of sponsored research on a program-by-program basis because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and, as such, are classified as costs of our research. The cost of sponsored research includes laboratory supplies, equipment repairs and maintenance and facility-related expenses.


	The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred on our platform and by program:

	Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our expenses related to salaries, bonuses and other related benefits costs will increase in the future as we attract and maintain additional personnel. We


	14





	expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we initiate clinical tria


	ls for certain of our product candidates, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates, and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates.



	General and Administrative Expenses


	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses and other related benefits costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate, business development, legal and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and general corporate matters; expenses associated with being a public company; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; other operating costs; and facility-related expenses.


	We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future, primarily due to additional compensation, including salaries, benefits, incentive arrangements and share-based compensation awards, as we increase our employee headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. Additionally, we expect our facility-related expenses to increase related to the lease we entered into in 2016 for space in Lexington, Massachusetts, which we intend to use primarily for our cGMP manufacturing, as well as for additional laboratory and office space.


	Other Income (Expense), net



	Other income (expense), net consists primarily of dividend and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents balances for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.







	Income Taxes




	We are a multi-national company subject to taxation in the United States, Japan, Ireland and Singapore. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a tax provision of $1.3 million and a tax benefit of less than $0.1 million, respectively. The increase in the tax provision is a result of additional income earned in the United States under a contract research agreement between our U.S. and Singapore entities.


	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates


	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, revenue, and related disclosures.


	Our critical accounting policies are described under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates”

	in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017. We believe that of our critical accounting policies, the accounting policies with respect to

	revenue recognition and income taxes

	involve the most judgment and complexity. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies.



	Accordingly, we believe these identified policies are critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. If actual results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.

	Research and development expenses were $14.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase of $10.0 million was due primarily to the following:






	 





	•






	an increase of $0.8 million


	 in preclinical research and development expenses related to our two HD programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102;













	 





	•






	an increase of $4.5 million in preclinical research and development expenses related to our DMD program, WVE-210201; and











	 





	•






	an increase of $4.7 million in research and development expenses related to other discovery programs, platform development and identification of potential drug discovery candidates, due to an increase of $2.2 million in salary and related benefits costs and an increase of $1.4 million in share-based compensation expense,


	both of which are the result of an increase in employee headcount


	, and an increase of $1.1 million in research and development supplies and services expenses and facility-related expenses.







	Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on changes in our consolidated research and development expenses from the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the three months ended March 31, 2017.

	General and Administrative Expenses



	General and administrative expenses were approximately $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase was due to an increase of $0.7 million in salary and related benefits costs and an increase of approximately $0.8 million in share-based compensation expense, both of which are the result of an increase in employee headcount, as well as an increase of $1.2 million in general and administrative supplies and services expenses and facility-related expenses.


	Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on changes in our consolidated general and administrative expenses from the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the three months ended March 31, 2017.




	Income Tax Benefit (Provision)


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a tax provision of $1.3 million and a tax benefit of less than $0.1 million, respectively, the increase in the tax provision is a result of additional income earned by in the United States under a contract research agreement between our U.S. and Singapore entities. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred in Japan, Ireland and Singapore, due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income in these jurisdictions.


	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	To date we have primarily funded our operations through private placements of debt and equity securities, public offerings of our ordinary shares and collaborations. Through March 31, 2017, we have received an aggregate of approximately $229.7 million net proceeds from these transactions. We received $89.3 million in net proceeds from private placements of our debt and equity securities, $100.4 million in net proceeds ($111.9 million gross proceeds) from our initial public offering, inclusive of the over-allotment exercise, and $40.0 million under the Pfizer Agreements, including $10.0 million as an upfront payment under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement and $30.0 million in the form of an equity investment.


	On April 18, 2017, we closed a follow-on underwritten public offering of 4,166,667 ordinary shares for gross proceeds of $100.0 million. 

	Net proceeds to us from the offering are expected to be approximately $93.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.



	Since our inception, we have not generated any product revenue and have incurred recurring net losses.


	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $129.5 million and an accumulated deficit of $111.5 million and restricted cash of $3.6 million related to letters of credit for our leased premises in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Lexington, Massachusetts.


	We expect that the capital resources available to us as of March 31, 2017 along with the net proceeds from our April 18, 2017 public offering, together with anticipated milestone payments under our existing collaboration with Pfizer, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2019. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.


	Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. On January 4, 2017, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 6, 2017, on which we registered for sale up to $500.0 million of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, purchase contracts and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine. After the closing of our follow-on underwritten public offering on April 18, 2017, approximately $400.0 million of securities remains available for issuance under this shelf registration. This shelf registration statement will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it was declared effective. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.

	Operating Activities


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, operating activities used approximately $17.4 million of cash, which was the result of our net loss of $21.0 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.3 million. The non-cash charges were mainly due to share-based compensation expense of $3.0 million and an increase in deferred rent of $1.0 million.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, operating activities used $7.1 million of cash, which was the result of our net loss of $7.8 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of less than $0.5 million, offset by non-cash charges of $1.2 million. The non-cash charges were related primarily to share-based compensation of $0.9 million.


	Investing Activities


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, investing activities used $3.6 million of cash, consisting primarily of purchases of property and equipment.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, investing activities used $0.7 million of cash, consisting of purchases of property and equipment.


	Financing Activities


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.2 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of share options of $0.2 million partially offset by payment on our capital lease obligation.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was less than $0.1 million, consisting of payment on our capital lease obligation.


	Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates on Cash


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash was $0.1 million, primarily due to changes in the Japanese yen from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash was less than $0.1 million, primarily due to changes in the Japanese yen from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016.

	Funding Requirements



	We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing research and development activities and the establishment of our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:






	 





	•






	file clinical trial applications with global regulatory agencies and initiate clinical studies for our two programs in Huntington’s disease and our program in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy;











	 





	•






	conduct research and continue preclinical development of the discovery targets and advance additional programs into development;











	 





	•






	make strategic investments in expanding our R&D platform capabilities and in optimizing our manufacturing processes and formulations;











	 





	•






	develop manufacturing capabilities through outsourcing and establishing a scalable manufacturing facility;











	 





	•






	maintain our intellectual property portfolio and consider the acquisition of complementary intellectual property;











	 





	•






	seek and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; and











	 





	•






	establish and build capabilities to market, manufacture and distribute our product candidates.







	We may experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges.


	Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates or follow-on programs, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development for our therapeutic programs. Our future capital requirements for our therapeutic programs will depend on many factors, including:






	 





	•






	the progress and results of conducting research and preclinical and clinical development within our therapeutic programs and with respect to future potential pipeline candidates;











	 





	•






	the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies for our product candidates;











	 





	•






	the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review for our product candidates;











	 





	•






	the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;











	 





	•






	the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;











	 





	•






	the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;











	 





	•






	the effect of competing technological and market developments; and











	 





	•






	the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates.











	Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms when we need them, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds, except for possible future payments from Pfizer if milestones under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement are achieved. On January 4, 2017, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 6, 20


	17 (the “2017 Shelf”), on which we registered for sale up to $500.0 million of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, purchase contracts and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine. On April 18, 2017, we closed a follow-on underwritten public offering of 4,166,667 for gross proceeds of $100.0 million under the 2017 Shelf. Following that closing, approximately $400.0 million of securities remains available for issuance under the 2017 Shelf. This registration statement will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it was declared effective. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Additional debt


	19





	financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include


	covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute our shareholders’ owners


	hip interests.



	If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.


	Contractual Obligations and Commitments


	There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Contractual Obligations and Commitments” in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017.


	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


	We had no off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) as of March 31, 2017 that had or were reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.


	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	For detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.










	Item 3. Quantitative and Qual


	itative Disclosures about Market Risk.


	Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as, to a lesser extent, inflation, and capital market risk.


	Interest Rate Risk


	We are exposed to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our business. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in readily available checking and money market accounts.


	Foreign Currency Risk


	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the value of the Japanese yen, which is the currency in which our Japanese subsidiary conducts its business. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 0.3% and 0.2% of our assets, respectively, were located in Japan. Additionally, 0.7% and 1.2% of our general and administrative expenses were transacted in Japanese yen during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Furthermore, 1.3%, and 3.5% of our research and development expenses were transacted in Japanese yen during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. When the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the yen, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and expense from non-U.S. dollar denominated income and operating costs will decrease. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the yen, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and expenses from non-U.S. dollar denominated income and operating costs will increase. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our foreign currency sensitivity is affected by changes in the Japanese yen, which is impacted by economic factors both locally in Japan and worldwide. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.


	Inflation Risk


	We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	20







	Capital Market Risk



	We currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources. One possible source of funding is through further equity offerings. Our ability to raise funds in this manner depends in part upon capital market forces affecting our share price.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.


	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act

	, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.





	 


	 








	PART II – OTHER INFORMATION








	Item 1. Legal Proceedings.


	We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.









	Item 1A. Risk Factors.


	In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.









	Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.







	(a)






	Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities







	None.







	(b)






	Use of Proceeds







	On November 10, 2015, the SEC declared our registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-207379) effective for our initial public offering and we registered additional ordinary shares for our initial public offering on a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-207940) filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering, inclusive of the over-allotment exercise, were approximately $100.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on November 12, 2015 pursuant to Rule 424(b). We have been using and will continue to use the net offering proceeds to advance our product candidates through clinical trial programs and for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, we have used approximately $74.5 million of the net initial public offering proceeds.

Pipeline






WAVE is advancing a diverse pipeline of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics across a broad spectrum of rare genetic diseases. Uniquely versatile, our technology can potentially be applied to develop drugs in multiple therapeutic areas utilizing any oligonucleotide therapeutic platform, including antisense, RNAi and exon-skipping, among others.
The chart below depicts our development plans as of January 2017. Our core goal is to initiate six clinical programs by 2018. We are currently supporting this goal with over 20 discovery programs that are focused on identifying candidate leads. While we do not anticipate that all of our candidate selection efforts will result in the identification of viable candidates nor that each candidate we select will necessarily advance to an IND filing and further development, our strategy is to maintain a pipeline that provides multiple opportunities for clinical and commercial success and demonstrates the breadth of our abilities across multiple organ systems and tissues and therapeutic modalities.


This chart contains forward-looking statements.

Pure. Precise.  Exceptional, for Patients.
Pure. Precise.Exceptional, for Patients.
Welcome to WAVE Life Sciences. We are a preclinical genetic medicine company focused on advancing stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics that precisely target the underlying cause of rare diseases, with a goal of delivering exceptional treatment options for patients. 







Our Vision to Get There
Our proprietary chemistry eliminates the incredibly complex chemical mixtures that are inherent in all other nucleic acid therapies and can lead to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk and safety concerns. With this completely new approach, we can precisely control how our nucleic acid medicines target disease.
Our Platform
 







From Potential to Reality
Nucleic acid therapeutics hold the potential to treat numerous serious, often devastating genetic diseases. But various challenges have hindered rapid progress in the field. We are developing genetic medicines designed to overcome these challenges. Our preclinical pipeline spans multiple oligonucleotide modalities, potentially enabling us to address a broad range of rare disorders.
Our Pipeline

 







What it Means for Patients
By more effectively targeting underlying disease biology, we believe we will be able to maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. The result: optimally designed genetic medicines that work better for patients.
Our Promise

Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Spins Out from Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories (SNBL) with Funding from Leading Institutional Life Science InvestorsBack to WVE Snapshot

Share Story10:13AM ET 1/05/2017 PRNewswire

-- $12 Million Series A financing supports development of best-in-class therapy for acute migraine that incorporates novel and proprietary SNBL nasal drug delivery technology --


SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a leader in developing best-in-class therapies to address the unmet needs of migraine sufferers, today announced the closing of a $12 million Series A financing co-led by RA Capital Management and TPG Biotech.  RA Capital Portfolio Manager and Managing Director, Rajeev Shah, and TPG Biotech Partner and Managing Director, Heath Lukatch, Ph.D., have joined Satsuma's board of directors.
Satsuma Pharmaceuticals plans to utilize funds provided by the Series A financing to accelerate development of its lead product candidate, STS101.  STS101 is a potential best-in-class therapy for migraine that combines the gold-standard anti-migraine drug, dihydroergotamine (DHE), with unique and proprietary dry-powder nasal formulation and delivery technologies created and developed over the past 15 years by SNBL that enable rapid absorption with high bioavailability of drugs delivered via the nose.  DHE has multiple therapeutic advantages over other migraine therapies, including triptan therapies, but is not currently available in a fast-acting, patient-friendly, non-injectable preparation that achieves a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that achieved with injection.  
STS101 has undergone extensive preclinical optimization and evaluation. Based on pharmacokinetic data generated to date, Satsuma anticipates STS101 will have a rapid onset of action and be highly effective and well-tolerated in a large number of migraine sufferers whose needs are not well served with current therapies, including those with difficult-to-treat migraine types. "We look forward to building upon the strong technology foundation established by our colleagues at SNBL over the past 15 years, expeditiously advancing development of STS101, and making STS101 available to migraine sufferers," commented John Kollins, Satsuma Pharmaceuticals co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer.  
"Many migraine sufferers are underserved with current therapies, and we believe the market for migraine therapeutics is poised for significant growth," commented Rajeev Shah, Portfolio Manager and Managing Director at RA Capital. "We believe Satsuma Pharmaceuticals and STS101 are well-positioned to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to patients with a highly-differentiated, best-in-class product that will be a valued addition to physicians' anti-migraine armamentarium." 
"Our diligence indicates physicians and migraine sufferers strongly desire a fast-acting, effective, non-injected DHE product with the profile and attributes we anticipate STS101 will have.  We look forward to working with Satsuma and SNBL to support development of STS101 and potentially additional products that utilize SNBL's unique dry-powder nasal formulation and delivery technology to address significant unmet patient needs," said Heath Lukatch, Ph.D., Partner and Managing Director at TPG Biotech.
About Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd.Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, SNBL is a leading global preclinical and clinical contract research services provider and creator of innovative therapeutic technologies, including the proprietary dry-powder nasal formulation and drug delivery device technologies incorporated in Satsuma's lead product candidate, STS101, and the stereopure nucleic acid therapeutic technology being developed by SNBL spinout company, WAVE Life Sciences (NASDAQ: WVE).

Nucleic acid therapeutics are poised to radically change the medical landscape, offering the potential to treat numerous serious, often devastating, genetically defined diseases that until now have proven “undruggable.”
To date, nucleic acid therapeutics have been comprised of complex mixtures of hundreds of thousands of chemical entities known as stereoisomers. Some stereoisomers in these mixtures have therapeutic effects, while others are less beneficial or contribute to undesirable side effects. Uncontrolled stereoisomer drug mixtures can lead to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk and safety concerns.
Our novel chemistry platform eliminates these complex chemical mixtures, giving us control over the pharmacology of our stereopure medicines in development. Rationally designed, our stereopure nucleic acid therapies precisely target underlying disease biology and in our proof-of-concept studies they have demonstrated improved activity, stability, specificity and immunogenicity compared with stereoisomer mixtures. As a result, we believe we will be able to maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. By doing so, our goal is to unleash the true and vast promise of nucleic acid therapeutics to treat numerous diseases.
From complex to pure: Our approach for designing exceptional nucleic acid medicines for patients
PURE COMPOSITION
  Nucleic acid therapeutics are a large and innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target ribonucleic acid, or RNA, to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins. Each nucleic acid therapeutic is made up of strings of nucleotides, each held together by chemical linkages. The orientation of atoms at each linkage occurs randomly using conventional synthesis, adopting either an “up” or “down” orientation. Because a nucleic acid therapeutic has multiple linkages, an enormous numbers of permutations are possible, often resulting in over half-a-million different molecules in every dose. WAVE is the first company to fully control the orientation of the linkages and develop stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. 
PRECISE DESIGN
  Nucleic acid therapies employ various molecular mechanisms to carry out their function. These mechanisms include those that promote degradation of the target RNA, like antisense and RNAi, and those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function, like exon skipping. Nucleic acid therapies that promote degradation of the target RNA utilize very specific, naturally occurring enzymes. For instance, antisense therapies rely on the enzyme RNase H, whereas RNAi therapeutics rely on Ago2. In each case the nucleic acid therapeutic makes specific interactions with the enzyme. By controlling the orientation of the linkages WAVE is able to optimize the interaction between a nucleic acid therapy and various enzymes to improve pharmacology. 
OUR GOAL: Exceptional Outcomes for Patients
  We have shown in proof-of-concept studies that WAVE chemistry enables improvements in activity, stability and specificity compared to mixture-based approaches and that it can be utilized across any target sequence. At WAVE, we are focused on developing optimally designed nucleic acid therapies that will be safer and more effective for patients. Using our chemistry and approach, our aim is to develop targeted treatments for a broad spectrum of rare, serious and previously untreatable genetic conditions.

By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Clinical Trials Week -- Wave Life Sciences Ltd. (NASDAQ:WVE), a biotechnology company focused on delivering transformational therapies for patients with serious, genetically-defined diseases, announced the initiation of the Company's PRECISION-HD program, which includes PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2, the Company's two Phase 1b/2a clinical trials evaluating WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, for patients with Huntington's disease (HD) (see also Neurodegenerative Diseases and Conditions - Huntington Disease).
"Wave's PRECISION-HD program is the first to target the underlying cause of Huntington's disease with an allele-specific approach," said Michael Panzara, MD, MPH, Neurology Franchise Lead of Wave Life Sciences. "Obtaining approvals to initiate these global studies as part of our first clinical program marks an important milestone for Wave. More importantly, these investigational compounds have the potential to address a critical unmet need for the HD patient community where no disease-modifying treatments are currently approved."
PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 are Phase 1b/2a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that will primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, administered intrathecally in HD patients. Additional exploratory objectives include assessing the impact that each compound has on the toxic mutant protein known to cause loss of brain cells in HD, as well as evaluating potential clinical effects and impact on brain atrophy as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both PRECISION-HD trials will follow the same protocol, and each will target a single nucleotide polymorphism, or "SNP," that marks a separate and distinct location on the mutant huntingtin (HTT) gene transcript. Wave intends to enroll approximately 50 patients globally in each of the two studies through multiple sites, in Canada initially, with Europe and the United States to follow.
The PRECISION-HD trials for WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 will include adult patients with early manifest HD who carry a SNP at the rs362307 ("SNP1") or the rs362331 ("SNP2") location, respectively. Potential HD patients for the PRECISION-HD program will be pre-screened for the presence of SNP1 or SNP2, and directed to the appropriate study upon qualifying for entry. Approximately two-thirds of all HD patients are expected to carry either SNP1, SNP2, or both, in association with the HD gene.
SNPs are a common type of genetic variation that normally occur in all humans, but may also act as biological markers to aid in locating genes associated with a particular disease. Previous HD research has identified multiple SNPs that are associated with the disease-causing expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat, which is an abnormality present in all HD patients that results in the production of mutant huntingtin protein, and causes HD. Therefore, Wave is utilizing common SNPs to precisely target the underlying cause of the disease.

(WVE), a genetic medicines company focused on developing targeted therapies for patients impacted by rare diseases, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.“The beginning of 2017 was marked by continued advancement of our lead programs in HD and DMD and substantial progress in our collaboration with Pfizer. Our two HD programs and our DMD program remain on track to enter the clinic in 2017, and we will announce our next three pipeline candidates later this year,” said Paul Bolno, M.D., MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of WAVE Life Sciences. “We have also made significant advancements within our discovery platform, deepening our knowledge and capabilities in both existing (antisense and exon skipping) and new (ssRNAi and splicing) modalities, and we are exploring new approaches to identify and target specific cell populations as we look ahead to our next set of pipeline candidates.”First Quarter Business Update Lead programs and pipeline expansion on track in 2017WAVE’s two lead programs in Huntington’s disease (“HD”) and one lead program in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) are on track to advance into clinical trials in 2017. In HD, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 are expected to enter the clinic in mid-2017. In DMD, WVE-210201 is expected to enter the clinic in the second half of 2017. In addition, WAVE intends to select an additional three program candidates in 2017 and is on track to deliver six development programs by the end of 2018.  Manufacturing facility development underwayIn 2016, WAVE entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, MA. WAVE continued its substantial progress with the build-out during the first quarter, and the company plans to occupy the facility by the end of the second quarter. The facility will provide WAVE with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) capabilities and increase the company’s control and visibility of its drug product supply chain.Investment in broad manufacturing capabilities is intended to grant WAVE and its current and future partners greater independence and flexibility in bringing multiple products to market. The company expects its internal expertise in cGMP manufacturing will support growth of clinical drug product for its current and future development activities and could support commercial-scale manufacturing.  Accessing new tissue areas and cells with expanding discovery platformIntrathecal administration of WAVE’s compounds in non-human primates demonstrated broad distribution in the central nervous system (“CNS”). As WAVE’s portfolio of programs expands into additional neurological disorders, WAVE is exploring the ability to target specific cell-types and regions (i.e. astrocytes, microglia, spinal motor neurons) of the CNS using chemical modifications, while also characterizing cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking relevant to antisense, RNAi and splicing modalities. For example, in Q4 2016, WAVE entered into a collaboration with nLife Therapeutics, to access their conjugate chemistry platform and support some of WAVE’s enhanced discovery efforts. Additionally, WAVE continues to explore therapeutic areas outside of neurology, including liver, eye and skin, with external collaborators. In these areas, WAVE has demonstrated productive distribution in-vivo to key cell types in the liver (hepatocytes via GalNAc conjugation), in the eye (RPE and the trabecular meshwork via intravitreal and intracamaral injections), and in the skin (suprabasal layer keratinocytes (topical)).  $100mm financing completed in April to support manufacturing and platform developmentIn April 2017, WAVE raised $100.0 million in gross proceeds in its first follow-on public offering. With these additional proceeds, WAVE is well positioned to support its continued investment in manufacturing independence with the potential for full-scale commercial readiness, and to pursue its previously stated goal of delivering six development programs by the end of 2018. In furtherance of these objectives, WAVE is focused on advancing the additional three programs to be named later this year, and continuing to invest in its platform to drive the discovery and advancement of future therapeutic candidates. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Financial GuidanceWAVE reported a net loss of $21.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to a net loss of $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in net loss for the first quarter was mainly due to increased research, discovery and development expenses as well as increased salary and benefits expenses as WAVE continues to attract key talent and grow its organization to support its corporate goals.Research and development expenses were $14.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year was largely due to increases in supplies and services expenses, related to the continued development of WAVE’s three lead programs as well as its discovery and platform activities, along with increases in its salary and benefits expenses, due to the increase in headcount.General and administrative expenses were $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $3.2 million for the same period in the 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses year-over-year was driven by increases in salary and benefits expenses, due to an increase in headcount, as well as increases in other general and administrative expenses.As of March 31, 2017, which was prior to the closing of the follow-on offering discussed above, WAVE had cash and cash equivalents totaling $129.5 million as compared to $150.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of WAVE’s first quarter net loss.WAVE expects that the cash and cash equivalents available as of March 31, 2017 along with the net proceeds from the April 2017 public offering, together with anticipated milestone payments under its existing collaboration with Pfizer, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2019.About WAVE Life SciencesAt WAVE Life Sciences, we are driven by an unwavering passion and commitment to deliver on our mission of confronting challenging diseases by developing transformational therapies and empowering patients.

We estimate that we will receive approximately $91.3 million in net proceeds
from the sale of our ordinary shares in this offering, or approximately
$105.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
ordinary shares in full, based upon the initial public offering price of
$16.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $11.3 million to fund additional preclinical studies and Phase 1
  clinical trials for our HD HTT SNP-1 program;                      

. approximately $13.4 million to fund the selection of a lead product candidate
  and additional preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials for our HD HTT
  SNP-2 program;                                              

. approximately $14.2 million to fund additional preclinical studies and Phase 1
  clinical trials for our DMD Exon 51 program; and                   

. approximately $11.6 million to fund the selection of a lead product candidate
  and additional preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials for our IBD 
  SMAD7 program.                                                 

The remainder of the net proceeds will be used to advance our discovery
programs, to expand our pipeline, for working capital and for other general
corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire,
license and invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses;
however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to do so.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending upon numerous factors. We may find it necessary or 
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and our management will 
retain broad discretion in the allocation of our net proceeds from this 
offering.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development activities, feedback from regulatory
authorities, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our current and
future product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

As of June 30, 2015, we had cash of $7.8 million. We believe that the net
proceeds from this offering, together with the approximately $62.5 million in
net proceeds raised from the sale and issuance of our Series B preferred shares
in August 2015, and our cash and related interest we earn on these balances,
will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least
2017. We will need to raise substantial additional funds before we can expect to
commercialize any products. We may satisfy our future cash needs through the
sale of equity securities, debt financings, working capital lines of credit,
corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant funding, through interest
income earned on cash balances or a combination of one or more of these sources.

Pending use of our net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments. We cannot predict whether the
net proceeds will yield a favorable return.


The pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing
technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.
While we believe that our expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics, scientific
knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive
advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including
major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research
institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on
nucleic acid therapeutics, but any product candidates that we successfully
develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies
that may become available in the future.

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among
a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also
prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large and established companies.

Huntington’s Disease

There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of
Huntington’s disease. We believe, based on publicly available information, that
(i) Isis Pharmaceuticals and Roche (Phase 1/2) and Sangamo Biosciences
(preclinical) are developing therapies that directly target the huntingtin RNA
and (ii) a number of other companies are developing drugs to treat symptoms
associated with Huntington’s disease, including Auspex Pharmaceuticals and Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries (which have submitted an New Drug Application, or NDA,
to the FDA), Prana Biotechnology (Phase 2), Siena Biotech (Phase 2), Raptor
Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Omeros Corporation (Phase 2), Pfizer (Phase 2) and
Ipsen (Phase 2), among others.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

There are no therapies approved for the treatment of DMD in the United States.
We believe, based on publicly available information, that (i) PTC Therapeutics,
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and Sarepta Therapeutics are each developing exon
skipping nucleic acid therapies to specifically target the disease-associated
exons of the dystrophin RNA and all have submitted an NDA to the FDA and (ii) a
number of other companies, including Summit Therapeutics (Phase 1), are
developing or have approval to market drugs that can alter the progression of
the disease in patients.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease

There are a limited number of drugs available for the treatment of IBD (either
UC or CD) including mesalazine, azathioprine, budesonide and vedoluzimab. We
believe based on publicly available information that (i) Celgene is developing a
nucleic acid therapy to target CD (Phase 2) and (ii) other companies either are
developing or have approval to sell drugs to treat the symptoms of IBD,
including Johnson & Johnson, Receptos, Pfizer, Eisai, Mylan, Novartis, Takeda
and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, among others.


Company Description
We are a preclinical biopharmaceutical company with an innovative and
proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to
design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or
best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. Nucleic acid


 therapeutics
have the potential to address diseases that have been difficult to treat with
small molecule drugs or biologics. Currently, there are two nucleic acid
therapeutics that have received regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, and others are in development. We are initially
developing nucleic acid therapeutics that target genetic defects to either
reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production
of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins.

The nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure, meaning they are
comprised of molecules having atoms uniformly arranged in three-dimensional
orientations, which we believe is advantageous for making drugs with consistent
pharmacologic properties. The stereopure therapies we are developing differ from
the mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in
development by others. Those therapies are mixtures of many thousands of
molecules, each having varying three-dimensional atomic arrangements. Such
variations may lead to potentially differing pharmacologic properties, with some
constituent molecules producing therapeutic effects and others being less
beneficial or even contributing to undesirable side effects. Building upon the
innovative work of our scientific founders, Gregory L. Verdine, Ph.D. and
Takeshi Wada, Ph.D., our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our
stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior drug properties as
compared to mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. Our platform is designed to
enable us to rationally design, optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid
therapeutics. Further, it has the potential to be used to design therapies that
utilize any of the major molecular mechanisms employed by nucleic acid
therapeutics, including antisense, ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi, and
exon skipping, as described below.

Our goal is to develop disease-modifying drugs for indications with a high
degree of unmet medical need, in both orphan and broad diseases. We are
initially focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that
can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases
across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local
administration.

Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in Huntington’s disease, Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD.

. In Huntington’s disease, we have programs targeting two disease-associated 
  single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, within the huntingtin gene – HTT 
  SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2. SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given
  genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between
  two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing
  production of a defective protein and causing disease. It has been shown that
  by targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2, the production of disease-causing 
  proteins associated with Huntington’s disease can be prevented. We have 
  selected a lead product candidate in our HTT SNP-1 program and we expect to 
  select a lead candidate in our HTT SNP-2 program in early 2016. We expect to 
  file investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the FDA for our 
  candidate targeting HTT SNP-1 in late 2016 and our candidate targeting HTT 
  SNP-2 in early 2017.                           

. In DMD, we have a program targeting Exon 51, a region within the ribonucleic 
  acid, or RNA, transcribed from the dystrophin gene. DMD is a genetic disorder 
  caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, including those in Exon 51, that 
  result in dysfunctional Dystrophin protein, and it has been shown that 
  production of functional Dystrophin protein can be restored by targeting Exon 
  51. We have selected a lead product candidate in our Exon 51 program and 
  expect to file an IND with the FDA for this candidate in late 2016.       

. In IBD, we have a program targeting the RNA transcribed from the SMAD7 gene. 
  Overproduction of the SMAD7 protein has been shown to increase 
  gastro-intestinal, or GI, inflammation and exacerbate IBD. It has also been
  demonstrated that by targeting the RNA transcribed from the SMAD7 gene, the
  overproduction of the SMAD7 protein can be suppressed, thereby decreasing GI 
  inflammation. We expect to select a lead candidate in our SMAD7 program in 
  early 2016. We expect to file an IND with the FDA for this candidate in 2017.

We also have late-stage discovery programs in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, or
EBS, and in DMD.

. In EBS, we are targeting KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2. EBS is caused by 
  mutations in the KRT14 gene, which result in the production of defective KRT14
  proteins that manifest the symptoms of EBS. KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2 are 
  disease-associated SNPs within the KRT14 gene, and we have shown in 
  preclinical experiments that by targeting these SNPs selective reduction in 
  the expression of the disease associated gene can be achieved. We expect to 
  identify lead candidates in our KRT14 SNP-1 and KRT14 SNP-2 programs in 2016. 

. In DMD, we are also developing therapies targeting Activin Receptor type IIb,
  or AcRIIb, that can promote skeletal muscle growth. It has been shown that 
  such muscle growth can be promoted by silencing the RNA transcribed from the 
  gene encoding AcRIIb. We believe that targeting AcRIIb could be beneficial in 
  cases where DMD has progressed to a state of advanced muscle damage, where 
  exon-skipping therapies (including the candidates we are developing in our 
  exon-skipping DMD program) may be less effective. We expect to identify a lead
  candidate in our AcRIIb program in 2016.         

Furthermore, we believe that, based on our initial selection criteria of novel
and fast-follower opportunities, our platform can potentially be used in the
near-term to design treatments for approximately 25 other potential target
indications, mostly consisting of orphan indications, with an initial focus on
orphan neuromuscular and central nervous system disease targets.

We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the
development and commercialization of our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics.
Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect
stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed
to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular
stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological
activity). Oligonucleotides are chemically modified, short-length strands of RNA
or deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Our portfolio also includes filings on both
methods and reagents that are designed to protect various features of the
chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide
compositions. Our portfolio also includes filings designed to protect methods of
using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect
particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a 
particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside or backbone modification, or both, 
pattern of backbone linkages and pattern of backbone chiral centers. A chiral 
center is an atom that is bonded to a defined set of pendant groups arranged in
three-dimensional space in a way that is not superimposable on its mirror image.

We believe that our technology provides us with a unique position in the
therapeutic oligonucleotide marketplace. Due to prior or expected patent
expirations and patent invalidations, we believe that a variety of useful and
effective oligonucleotide chemistries, such as certain backbone and sugar
modifications, that have been developed in the industry will be available to the
public prior to when we expect our drugs will be commercialized. Therefore, we
believe that we can readily incorporate these chemistries or other chemistries
into our stereopure drugs. Moreover, our strategy does not require or rely on a
particular chemistry or any particular nucleotide sequence, thus permitting us
to navigate the intellectual property landscape in the field while developing
our novel and proprietary oligonucleotide drugs.
