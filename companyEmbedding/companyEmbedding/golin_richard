Colin Richard FORMAN 
A.K.A.: "The Zardad's Dog"

Classification: Serial killer
Characteristics: Robbed travelers on the road from Kabul to Jalalabad
Number of victims: 20 +
Date of murder: 1990s
Date of birth: 1965
Victim profile: Men and women
Method of murder: Several methods
Location: Paghman District, Afghanistan
Status: Executed by shot in the back of the head on April 20, 2004

The Connellan air disaster was a suicide attack at Alice Springs Airport, Northern Territory, Australia on 5 January 1977. Carried out by a disgruntled former employee of Connellan Airways (Connair), who flew a Beechcraft Baron into the Connair complex at the airport, the attack killed four other people and injured four more, two of them seriously. The disaster is one of only two aircraft suicide attacks in Australia's history, the other being in 1982 at Bankstown Airport.
Background
The perpetrator, Colin Richard Forman, was 23 years old at the time of the attack. He had migrated from the United Kingdom to Australia alone in the early 1970s, but had trouble adjusting and, in 1974, tried to forge a Qantas ticket back to England. The forged ticket was detected and Forman had a conviction recorded against him.
In November 1975, Forman obtained a commercial pilot's license, and he started flying for Connair in January 1976. However, the ticket forgery soon came to light and Forman was dismissed after seven weeks. He then found another job at Ord Air Charter in Wyndham, but was soon fired from there as well. Forman apparently believed that Roger Connellan, his boss at Connair, had informed Ord Air about his forgery conviction.
Attack
Early on the morning of 5 January 1977, Forman drove to Wyndham, Western Australia, and stole a Beechcraft 58 Baron twin-engine piston plane (registration number VH-ENA) from the airfield. Before leaving, he wrote a suicide letter in his pilot's logbook, giving the entry the title "Alice Springs Suicide Mission" and stating that his aim was “to kill and maim as many employees of Connair Pty Ltd as possible”.
Alice Springs is four hours flying time from Wyndham in a Beechcraft Baron, and Forman had planned to strike at 10 am during the company's morning break. However, he did not account for the time difference between Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and arrived at 11 am. He broadcast a final message by radio, stating “It is better to die with honor than live without it – Echo – November – Alpha.” Forman then set full power on both engines and aimed at the Connellan complex before plunging into the building.
The plane hit the center of the Connair building. Roger Connellan (32 years old), son of founder Eddie Connellan, was killed instantly, along with engineers Markus Chittoni (31) and Ron Dymock (48). Secretary Liana Nappi (19) was badly burned and died of her wounds five days later.
Aftermath
Connellan Airways was sold to East-West Airlines in 1980.
The attack remains a sore topic in Alice Springs and is intentionally not covered by the Central Australian Aviation Museum.

FEATURED SERIAL KILLER ARTICLE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURVIVED VICIOUS SERIAL KILLERS
By Lori Bell
Most people remember the names of infamous serial killers.  Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy --- these names and more ring  unwanted through our collective psyche, their crimes too horrendous to ignore.  However, very few remember the names of the victims of these depraved  individuals, perhaps because most never live to tell their tale.
In some cases, though, there are those who are fortunate  enough to escape the clutches of madness. Their stories serve as lessons in  survival that we can all learn from, lessons that could very well have saved a  life.
Maria Viricheva:
Three months pregnant and unmarried, 19 – year – old Maria  Viricheva was working as a saleswoman at the time of her encounter with one of Russia’s  most notorious serial killers --- Alexander Pichuskin. Known by the seemingly  bizarre name “The Chessboard Killer,” this deranged individual set out to kill  as many people as there are spaces on a chessboard. He later refuted this claim,  confessing that had he not been caught, he would have continued killing  indeterminately.
Attracted to the idea of having the power over the life or  death of another person, Pichuskin explained that he felt like God when he was  carrying out the murders. He would end the lives of his victims with a hammer  blow to the head. Chillingly he is quoted as saying, “I killed in order to live  because when you kill, you want to live.”
Maria was new at her job and had been set up with it by her boyfriend,  who was also the father of her child. Earlier that day, the two had gotten into  an argument,  and afterward she found  herself distraught in a metro station in Moscow. Pichuskin spied Maria, and  noting her obvious state of despair, struck up a conversation with her. Maria,  desperate and alone, welcomed the company.
Hearing of her situation, Pichuskin offered her a chance to  earn some additional money, telling her that he had stashed some stolen cameras  in a well in nearby Bittsevsky Park, and that he would give her some to sell. Even  though it was late in the evening, Maria not even knowing if her job would be  there in the morning anyway, agreed to go with him to retrieve the cameras.
When they arrived at the spot, Pichuskin lifted the cover  from the well and told her to look inside. As she did so, he quickly snatched  her up and threw her in. She clung to the sides of the well to avoid falling,  but Pichuskin grabbed her head and repeatedly slammed it into the side of the  well. She had little choice but to let go. The last thing she heard was her  killer yell, “take a bath there!” as she plummeted into the darkness.
She tumbled over 30ft. before landing knee – deep in sewage  water that was rapidly flowing down a drain pipe. She was caught in the  current, and only by swiftly removing her jacket and boots, did she manage to  place her hands and feet on the sides of the drain and stop her further decent.  Had she not done so, she would have reached the end of the drain pipe to a  section that was completely filled with water and drowned.
Fortunately, she stopped herself near another well leading  up from the drain pipe and managed to climb to the top, only to find that she  was too weak to push the well cover open above her. Luckily, a passing woman  heard her cries for help and saw the well cover raise a bit as Maria tried to  pry it open, and the woman ran to alert security guards. They lifted the well cover  and pulled Maria to safety.
Unbelievably, the police refused to investigate the incident  and forced Maria to sign a statement saying that she had fallen down the well  herself. She was only brought in to identify her attacker when he was finally  apprehended under suspicion of 48 murders. Had the police done their job the  first time, many lives might have been saved.
Viricheva is one three people known to have survived attacks  by Pichuskin. One survivor has no recollection of the attack because of the  head injury Pichuskin inflicted, while the third was a homeless boy, Mikhail Lobov,  who was 14 when Pichuskin threw him down the well. He submitted written  testimony to the court. He said he tried to tell police about Pichuskin but  that they would not listen to a homeless boy.
Pichuskin told the court that he almost had a nervous breakdown  when he saw Maria Viricheva near her apartment about six months after the  attack. Pichuskin is serving the first part of his sentence, which he must spend  in solitary confinement.
Whitney Bennett:
Young Whitney Bennett could not have known that leaving her bedroom  window unlocked before she went to bed on the night of July 4, 1985, would lead  to her being viciously attacked. This innocent mistake would lead her to a  night of pure horror and a lifetime of suffering. That night Richard Ramirez, also  known as The Night Stalker, crept through her bedroom window and savagely beat  her with a tire iron before ransacking her room and taking all the valuables.
The only thing the young girl could be thankful for was that  the first few blows quickly rendered her unconscious, though the strangulation  marks which were on her neck after the attack indicated that luck was truly on  her side that night. Two nights later, Ramirez perpetrated an almost identical  attack against another woman, Joyce L. Nelson, in her home. This time, the  attack was fatal.
The crime scene Ramirez left behind him was covered in Whitney’s  blood, and his bloody shoe print was found on her comforter. The distinctive  print also turned up at many other Night Stalker crime scenes. One such bloody  shoe print was found on the left cheek of Joyce L. Nelson. He had also  carelessly left the tire iron on her bedroom floor. As for Whitney Bennett, she  was left with permanent scarring from the attack and had to undergo extensive  cosmetic surgery. 
It was her testimony that helped convict Ramirez of his  crimes during his trial and ensured that he received the death sentence. Ramirez  was on trial for 13 murders in Los Angeles County. The self – proclaimed devil worshipper  from El Paso, also faced 30 other felony counts stemming from the series of  nighttime attacks in 1984 and 1985. He faced a 14th murder charge in  San Francisco, and an attempted murder and sexual assault charges in Orange  County. He ended up dying in prison of natural causes at the age of 53 before  the execution could take place.
Rhonda Williams:
After 40 years of silence, Rhonda Williams decided that  enough was enough and finally worked up the courage to tell of her twisted  involvement with one of Houston’s most notorious serial killers. Dean Corll,  and his younger accomplice, Elmer Wayne Henley, we’re responsible for the  murders of 29 young boys, all lured into Corll’s clutches for the purpose of satisfying  his sadistic sexual urges.
Dean Arnold Corll exclusively targeted teenage boys. He worked  from 1965 to 1968 in his family’s candy company, giving him his horrid  nickname, “The Candy Man.” He lured many if his victims with free candy and  also free alcohol and Marijuana.  His rampage  lasted from 1970 to 1973, during which he befriended two wayward accomplices,  David Brooks, and Elmer Henley.
Rhonda Williams had befriended Henley during her teenage  years and thought Henley was someone she could trust. Growing up in an  atmosphere of severe abuse and neglect, she was often beaten by her alcoholic  father and was even raped repeatedly as a toddler.
In August 1973, she placed her trust in Henley once again as  he snuck up to her bedroom window to help her escape another episode of abuse  at the hands of her father. Another boy, Tim Kerley, was waiting in the car for  them and the three drove away to what Williams thought was safety. Had she  known Henley’s true motives, she certainly would have decided against letting  him “rescue” her.
The trio arrived at Corll’s home, where they partied until  they passed out. Williams woke to a scene of unimaginable horror. She and two  other boys were bound hand and foot. Corll began kicking and screaming for her  to wake up, then he and Henley took the other two captives to another room and lashed  them both to what can only be described as “torture boards.”  Naively, she still believed that Henley would  not let her be hurt, even as she heard the screams of her captive companions.
Her trust was finally broken when Henley told her that he  would have to shoot her before the ordeal was over. However, something in  Henley finally broke, and instead he turned the gun on Corll and shot him dead,  saving the lives of all the captives.   Then Henley reached for the phone and called police.
Williams survived her night of horror thanks to the conscience  of her friend, and although he was jailed for a short time she made a promise  to him to remain silent about her ordeal from then on, only to speak about it  publicly four decades later. Henley, still in prison for his role in luring  victims to Corll, remains in contact with Williams to this day.
Teresa Thornhill :
Robert Black was a convicted child murderer and pedophile,  who claimed four young victims in Scotland between the 1970s and 1990s. Teresa  Thornhill was one of the few known survivors of his attacks. Black was  convicted in 1994 of the murders of 11 – year – old Susan Maxwell from the Scottish  Borders, five – year – old Caroline Hogg, from Edinboro,  and Sarah Harper, 10 from Morley near Leeds. 
On a warm day in April 1988, Teresa, 15 at the time, was  walking home when she caught the eye of Black, who was parked in a van by her  house. Faking car trouble as he exited the back of his van, Black asked the  young girl if she knew anything about engines. When she approached, he grabbed  her and placed one hand over her mouth, pinned her arms by her sides, and tried  to pull her into his van through the back doors. She screamed and bit his arm,  causing him to drop her just as a friend in the neighborhood came running to help,  scaring Black off. After her frightening experience she ran to her home and her  parents called the police. But it was already too late --- Black had already disappeared.
Two years passed and the young girl remained traumatized by  her experience, almost never going outside. She was one of the witnesses to  testify against him at his trial, where he was convicted of the three murders  and her kidnapping, receiving a life sentence for his crimes. While still in  prison, he was convicted of killing his fourth victim, a nine – year –old girl.  To this day, police are still investigating his case and suspect him of many  more murders.
Black has long been the prime suspect in the disappearance  of 13 – year – old, Genette Tate, who was last seen on a country lane in  Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978. No trace of the newspaper delivery girl has ever  been found. 
Teresa Thornhill says, “I can still see Robert Black’s face  every day.”
Tali Shapiro:
Eleven – year – old, Tali Shapiro didn’t like taking the  bus, so almost every day she would walk to school from her home in West  Hollywood. On a September morning in 1969, the young girl’s decision to walk  the short distance to her school would prove to be a costly mistake.
While walking down South Boulevard that morning, Rodney  Acala approached her in his vehicle and asked her if she wanted a ride. She  refused, saying that she was not allowed to talk to strangers. He assured her  that he knew her family and told her that he had a beautiful picture to show  her. Though wary, she approached his car. That’s the last thing she remembers  from that morning. Luckily, another man saw the abduction and called the  police.
Rodney Acala became known as, “The Dating Game Killer,”  after appearing as a contestant on the Dating Game show during the midst of his  murder spree. Posing as a professional photographer, Acala took over 1,000  disturbing photographs of women. While none of these individuals have been  positively identified as a missing person or unsolved homicide victim, there  may come a time when they are realized as casualties of the Dating Game Killer.
When the police arrived at his door, Acala tried to stall  them by claiming that he was  in the  shower, forcing them to kick the door in. Acala  escaped out the back door and the officers found young Tali on the floor of his  apartment in a state of near death, with a metal bar across her neck, as if  Acala had just been pinning her down when they arrived. The young girl was also  found to have been sexually assaulted. She was rushed to the hospital and  thankfully, survived her atrack.
Tali Shapiro was the second person to testify for jurors who  were considering the death penalty for Acala, who was convicted of killing four  Los Angeles County  women and a 10 – year  – old Huntington Beach ballet student. Like many brave victims recounted in  this article, Tali Shapiro later testified against her assailant, helping to  convict him. He was sentenced to death.
Acala, who had been representing himself, asked if she remembered  him apologizing to her when she testified at an earlier trial. She said she did  not.  “I sincerely regret and apologize  for my despicable actions that day,” was the apology he made. Shapiro did not respond.
Rose Steward:
Although Rose Steward has every justification for hating Dean  Carter, in an incredible act of forgiveness, she actively campaigns to spare  from the death penalty for her rape and the murders of five other people.
On March 29, 1984, Steward was woken up by an intruder  holding a knife to her neck. Over the next five hours she was repeatedly raped  and tortured by him, losing consciousness twice during the attack. She only  managed to survive ordeal by pretending to “like” her attacker, even going so  far as to kiss him, which caused him to leave without taking her life. When her  nightmare was finally over, she immediately sought help from a neighbor, who  contacted the police. Carter went on to rape and strangle five other women  throughout California over the next 18 days, and it was Steward’s testimony in  part, that helped prosecutors ensure that he received the death penalty for his  crimes.
After her assault, Steward started sleeping on her living  room floor. She kept a loaded gun under her pillow --- even after Carter was  arrested during a traffic stop a month later with his victim’s belongings in  his car.
During their first courtroom encounter --- Steward said she  managed to stare down Carter and felt stronger as a result. Steward worried  about how the victim’s families would regard her. She had come to know the  slain women --- Jillette Lenora Mills, 25, Susan Lynn Knoll, 25, Bonnie Ann  Gunthrie, 34, Janette Anne Cullins, 24, and Tok Chum Kim, 42, --- as “sisters”  and saw herself as their voice.
Would their families resent her for living while their loved  one’s died? Could she have prevented their murders by doing something  differently? Did he kill because he realized she had tricked him and decided to  leave no more witnesses? The loved ones of the other victims did not blame her.  They were kind and warm.
As he now sits on death row awaiting his fate, Steward herself  has actively campaigned against the death penalty, supporting what is known as  California Proposition 34, a ballot to replace all death sentences with  sentences of life without parole. Some of the other victim’s families are  understandably shocked by her decision. This has left Steward torn between her  belief that the death penalty is wrong, and her personal understanding of her  fellow victim’s pain. Only time will tell if Rose Steward will be there to see  Carter’s last day.
Bryan Hartnell:
While Bryan Hartnell was attending school at Pacific Union  College in San Francisco in the late 1960s, he had no idea that his bright future  would forever be scarred by one truly horrifying day. After driving to a scenic  lake in a remote part of the city with his girlfriend, Cecilia Shephard, the  couple parked their car and planned to enjoy their day in privacy. Unbeknownst  to them, the unknown man who would later be dubbed the Zodiac Killer had other  plans for them.
While they remained in their car, a man wearing a black hood  and a shirt with cross hairs etched on the front, approached the couple and  forced them out of the car at gunpoint. After forcing them to the ground, he proceeded  to stab both of them repeatedly. Then he just vanished, leaving them for dead.  Cecilia was later able to provide a description of the killer before she died  in the hospital. Bryan however, never saw his face and thus was left with the  frustration of not knowing who it was that took the life of the one he loved.
Hartnell was stabbed 8 times, his companion, Cecilia,  between 10 and 20. She died a day later at the hospital. Investigators say it  was one of the most brutal attacks they’ve ever seen. They believe the Zodiac  used a knife so passersby wouldn’t hear the sound of gunshots. Following the  attack the Zodiac Killer calmly walked away leaving intentional clues as to his  identity. He wanted to make it clear there was a serial killer on the loose.  The Zodiac craved attention.
Thankfully, the years that passed healed Hartnell’s wounds  not only physically, but emotionally as well.  Bryan is now a probate attorney and is married  with a family of his own. The Zodiac Killer remains unidentified to this day  and is still one of the most enduring crime mysteries of the 20th  century.
Corazon Attenza:
It was Corazon Attenza, a 23 – year – old exchange nurse  from the Phillipines, who opened the door to her apartment on the night of July  13, 1966, and unknowingly allowed brutal mass murderer, Richard Speck, into her  and her roommates’ lives. The first thing she noticed about him was the strong  smell of alcohol. She also saw the small gun he had pulled from his black  jacket. She was also the only one that survived that terrifying night.
Richard Speck committed all his murders in one day, sneaking  into a housing facility for student nurses and stabbing eight of them to death.  Speck’s savagery evoked world – wide horror and headlines --- and left a terrifying  legacy: the growing fear that Americans weren’t save anymore, even in their own  homes.
Gun in hand, Speck forced his way into the home and herded  the girls into the common room. He sliced some of the bed sheets into makeshift  ropes and bound them all tightly. At first, he didn’t harm the women, telling  them he just wanted some money, and that he would leave them alone. After a  short while, though, one by one, Speck proceeded to rape, stab and mutilate  them while Corazon, wracked with fear, hid under the beds in the room. At one  point, one of her friends was being assaulted on the bed directly above her.
The attacks went on for almost six hours, with Corazon not  daring to even whimper the entire time. Finally, at around five in the morning,  it was over. Due to Speck being highly intoxicated at the time of the attacks, he  apparently forgot about her and left the apartment after he thought his work  was finished. She escaped the scene of carnage through a bedroom window after  he left, and screamed for help. Her cries were heard by her neighbors and her  waking nightmare came to an end.
Due to the overwhelming amount of physical evidence Speck  had left at the scene --- and the fact that he had an extensive criminal record  already --- he was caught shortly afterward when he checked himself into a  local hospital after attempting suicide. He had slashed his wrists after  learning that he’d left Corazon alive, and a doctor at the hospital recognized  him from newspaper reports and contacted the police. Nine months later, a jury  took only 49 minutes of deliberation to sentence him to the electric chair. His  sentence was later overturned by the Supreme Court in 1972 and he was given  eight consecutive terms of 50 to 150 years. 
On December 5, a part of the terror ended when Speck, 49,  died of a heart attack in a hospital near Joliet, Illinois, where he had been  held for 24 years. Cremated by the state, and never showing any remorse for his  crimes, Speck took with him the horror of those crimes.
Larry Flynt:
Larry Flynt is famous as the outspoken and flamboyant  publisher of Hustler magazine, and the creator of a business empire. He is also  famous for nearly being assassinated by one, Joseph Paul Franklin, in an  attempt that left Mr. Flynt paralyzed from the waist down, when he was hit by  two bullets from Franklin’s high powered rifle.
What is not commonly known is that Mr. Flynt’s assailant was  a serial killer who was tried and convicted for eight murders across the United  States between 1977 and 1980, though he claimed to have killed a dozen more in  an attempt to start a “race war” in the country. Franlkin, a member of the Ku  Klux Klan, and a Neo – Nazi, spoke of “being at war.” Flynt was a direct  contradiction to Franklin’s highly religious beliefs and his moral stance  against pornography, particularly the interracial deceptions that were featured  in Hustler at the time. It was on March 6, 1978, that both Mr. Flynt and his  lawyer were shot by Franklin, who confessed in prison after being sentenced for  another shooting in which he received the death penalty.
Though Larry Flynt, who was left in constant pain, could  have understandably wished to see his assailant die, he actually lobbied for  Franklin’s sentence to be commuted to life in prison due to his stance against  the death penalty itself. To quote him exactly: “In all the years since the  shooting, I have never come face –to – face with Franklin. I would love an hour  in a room with him and a pair of wire – cutters and pliers, so I could inflict  the same damage on him that he inflicted on me. But, I do not want to kill him,  nor do I want to see him die …I just don’t think that the government should be  in the business of killing people. And I   think punishment by putting someone in a three – by – six cell, is a lot  greater than if you snuff out their life in a few seconds with a lethal  injection.”
Flynt filed a motion with the American Civil Liberties  Union in an effort to have Franklin’s  sentence commuted to be life behind bars. Despite Flynt’s best efforts, Joseph  Franklin was executed in November 2013. Franklin made no statement before his  execution, but told CNN during an interview that he was no longer racist, had  found religion, and repented.
Rebecca Garde:
Rebecca Garde worked as a telemarketer in Seattle in 1982.  She had just gotten off work and was tired of waiting out in the rain for her  bus, so she decided to hitchhike home on a cold night in November. The man who  eventually offered her a ride seemed as ordinary as the Dodge pickup he was  driving, so she happily accepted his offer. Had she known that he would  eventually be convicted of killing 48 women like her, she might have declined  instead. She had no way of knowing that the driver was Gary Ridgway, the Green  River Killer, one of the most prolific serial killers. She didn’t know the  terror he had in store for her.
While riding in his vehicle, she offered him sex in exchange  for $20, figuring she could use the money to buy weed when she got home. It was  at this point that she began to get an odd feeling about the man she was with,  so as a precaution, she asked to see his identification, which he agreed to.  This put her a little more at ease --- at least he wasn’t a cop. They parked by  a trailer park and the man suggested they go into the woods for some  privacy.  Once they reached a spot that  was relatively secluded, Gary Ridgway attacked, and tried to strangle her to  death from behind. Fighting him off by pushing him into a tree, she stunned him  and ran to a nearby trailer for help. Her attacker immediately fled the scene.
Due to her lifestyle and a general fear of the police, Garde  waited nearly two years after her attack before she contacted the authorities,  and though her forthcoming would not lead directly to his capture, it did help  law enforcement build a more solid case around the most prolific killer in the  United States. Ridgway picked up and killed at least 15 more women in the same  area along the Pacific Highway South, where he attacked Garde. Her description  of him at least gave them something to move on.
The majority of Ridgway’s victims were teenage girls who had  left tough or abusive homes, turning to the streets where they supported drug  habits through prostitution. In 2001, Ridgway was finally apprehended and  sentenced to life in prison. At the time of their brief initial encounter,  Garde said she thought Ridgway seemed odd. At 5’11”, and 150lbs, he wasn’t very  imposing, though she remembers that his hands were large and his eyes small.  Most of all, she said, “I remember the look in his eyes.” Rebecca Garde remains  his only known surviving victim.
We could never imagine the horror that these victims felt during  their ordeals but, the exhilaration of escape must have been mind boggling too.  Although they are “survivors,” their turmoil continues as they struggle  everyday with the memories of how close they were to becoming a statistic. Their  brave efforts saved lives and calmed fears of many, and brought to light the  identities of the many victims who lost their battle with evil.
