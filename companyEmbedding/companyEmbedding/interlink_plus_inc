About


What makes a successful trade show? One would most probably be the ability to attract a generous crowd, which will often be tantamount into success. More so, it could be also generating favorable sales figure if selling is part of the tradeshow. It could also be all about generating leads and increasing your network. The goals may vary, and in most instances, success can also be elusive. The latter is especially the case if it has been poorly planned and inferiorly executed. With such, InterLinkPlus is here to provide you with a wide array of trade show services in Las Vegas.

The principal purposes of this offering is to raise sufficient capital for us to
implement our business plan, become a reporting under the Exchange Act and
create a public market for our common shares. If we are unable to sell any
shares under the Primary Offering, we have sufficient funds to pay the costs of
this offering. However, expenses associated with meeting our reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act will take priority over anything else.


Competition in all aspects of the outsourced services and business services
industry is intense. We will compete against established outsourced business
services companies with name familiarity and greater financial resources. We
intend to use our relatively small size to our advantage by focusing on customer
service and by deploying unique marketing strategies. A large part of our effort
to compete against the other companies in our field will be directed to being
recognized in this market of large players and, as a small company, to gain the
trust of purchasing decision makers at our potential customers. In an effort to
effectively compete, we will focus heavily on providing excellent service to our
customers. We also intend to compete by running cutting edge marketing campaigns
that use the internet and other technologies to educate the market about our
services. Competitors may seek to duplicate the benefits of our services in ways
that do not infringe on any benefits that our services offer. As a result we
could find that our entire marketing plan and business model is undercut or made
irrelevant by actions of other companies under which we have no control. We
cannot promise that we can accomplish our marketing goals and as a result may
experience negative impact upon our operating results.


Company Description
Our business is divided into two major segments: travel agency assistance
services and convention services.

We provide services for oversea travel agents on hotel price quotation and
negotiation, contract reviewing, detailed guests’ arrangements, hotel check-in
assistance and tradeshow assistance.


 Oversea travel agents often encounter
language barriers and time differences on office hours when dealing with U.S.
based hotels. We believe that our bilingual language services, flexible office
hours, and reasonable fee structure will help our clients to increase accuracy
and efficiency levels, and reduce costs.

Exhibitors and attendees often have temporary assistance needs at conventions
and trade shows. We intend to assist our clients on document/tradeshow material
translations, entourage interpreter and/or exhibitor booth personnel
arrangements, including bilingual spokespersons, sales associates, narrators and
demonstrators, hostesses/hosts, promoters and models.
---

We were incorporated in Nevada on May 11, 2015. Our principal executive office
is located at 4952 S Rainbow Blvd, Suite 326 Las Vegas, NV 89118. Our phone 
number is 702-815-7557.
