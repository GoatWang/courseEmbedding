Greg Peters to take over as chief product officer in July; chief talent officer Tawni Cranz is departing




Netflix said international exec Greg Peters will become chief product officer in July, taking over for Neil Hunt, who is leaving the company after 18 years.
In addition, Netflix announced that chief talent officer Tawni Cranz, who joined the company in 2007, will depart to pursue other interests.
Hunt (pictured above), who has a doctorate in computer science, joined Netflix in 1999. He led the development and launch of the company’s streaming service in 2007, and has overseen every aspect of the Netflix service’s user experience. “I’m delighted to be leaving the Netflix product organization in such great shape and in such good hands,” Hunt said in a statement.







Peters has led development efforts from Netflix’s office in Tokyo since 2015. In his nine years at the company, Peters has held positions overseeing product engineering and business development. In his role leading Netflix Japan, he also oversaw content licensing and creation as well as marketing.
“Greg and Neil have collaborated through the years to make the Netflix experience all over the world absolutely incredible,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in announcing the changes. “I look forward to having Greg take on this role and to celebrate with Neil our 100 millionth member.”
Prior to joining Netflix, Peters was senior VP of consumer electronics products at Macrovision Solutions and previously held positions at Mediabolic, Red Hat Network and Wine.com. He holds a degree in physics and astronomy from Yale University.
Regarding Cranz, Hastings said, “Over the last decade, Tawni has played a formative role in developing our business culture as well as developing an amazing talent team. We deeply appreciate her contributions.”

I feel like I burned through all of NETFLIX’s library in 2 months and not much of the original content appeals (nor do old British shows) so I dumped it for HULU and I’m so glad I did. More, relevant, options. Shows you want to binge watch.

Netflix really isn’t impressive — at all — the moment you step off American soil and into any other market they serve. Can’t deny what they’ve achieved, but in every other country but the U.S., the local competition all but ensures Netflix isn’t the only option.

If they were responsible for the horrible new rating system – “see ya – wouldn’t wanna be ya”..  If not.. sorry to see them go.  Maybe they will start a great competitor with a rating system that isn’t dummied down to the lowest base and useless for users.

Both wonderful people whom I hope are leaving of their own accord onto greener pastures. Especially a shame re: Tawni, the only female and minority representative on the c-level at Netflix…

Who cares that she is female an a minority? She was incompetent at her job. Netflix wants top talent in every role. I’ve been in a lot of meetings where she just hand waved and used buzz words as she road the coattails of Patty McCord who really did invent the Netflix culture you hear so much about.
Once she explained that she was rethinking a lot of “sacred cows” like remote working. Someone asked “what other sacred cows are you rethinking” and she was totally stumped. I think that I have seen her dance more times than I have heard her speak.

Greg Peters to Become Netflix Chief Product Officer in July
Eighteen Year Veteran Neil Hunt to Leave the Company Mid-Year; Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz Also Leaving Netflix

Los Gatos, CA., April 7, 2017 -- Netflix Inc. announced today that Greg Peters will become Chief Product Officer in July, assuming the role from Neil Hunt, who for the last eighteen years has led the product team which designs, builds, and delivers the Netflix experience.
Peters most recently has led international development efforts from the Netflix office in Tokyo since 2015. In his nine years at Netflix, Peters has held positions overseeing product engineering and business development and in his role leading Netflix Japan, marketing and content licensing and creation.
“When I first met Greg nine years ago, I knew he was an especially gifted engineer and entrepreneur,” said Hunt. “I’m delighted to be leaving the Netflix product organization in such great shape and in such good hands.”
“Neil has been an amazing leader who uniquely brings together analytical rigor, deep engineering chops, human warmth and a wry sense of humor,” said Peters. “I’ve been lucky to have him as my mentor.”
“Greg and Neil have collaborated through the years to make the Netflix experience all over the world absolutely incredible,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix Co-Founder and CEO. “I look forward to having Greg take on this role and to celebrate with Neil our 100 millionth member.”
Prior to joining Netflix, Peters was senior vice president of consumer electronics products at Macrovision Solutions and previously held positions at Mediabolic Inc., Red Hat Network and Wine.com. He holds a degree in physics and astronomy from Yale University.
Separately, Netflix also announced that Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz, who joined the company in 2007, would leave the company and pursue other interests.
“Over the last decade, Tawni has played a formative role in developing our business culture as well as developing an amazing talent team,” said Hastings. “We deeply appreciate her contributions.”

Using Psychology To Staff Netflix, Tawni Cranz Is Very Cool!

Posted on August 11th, 2012 by david 

In the tech sector, major fields can change with alarming speed.  A few years ago, for example, the idea of streaming movies and music from the Cloud was a far-fetched notion and even the leaders of big businesses in the tech sector were unsure how to capitalize on such an idea.  Now, there are several companies and services that offer streaming video and it is a huge business.  Given the rapidly-changing nature of technology, human resources personnel for media technology companies, like Netflix and Hulu, have their work cut out for them.  When they make a hire, they have to evaluate how the candidate will work for the company as it is now and how it might radically change in the future.  In the case of Netflix, managing the personnel is made much easier thanks to Tawni Cranz.
 
Tawni Cranz is the Vice President of Talent at Netflix.  Cranz has been with Netflix since April of 2007, when she was hired as the company’s Director of Human Resources.  In April 2011, Cranz was promoted to Vice President of Talent and she has since proven herself to be an exceptional manager of the personnel at Netflix.
 
Human resources management was not the most obvious career choice for Tawni Cranz, whose college education focused initially on psychology.  In 1991, Cranz enrolled at the University of California at Santa Barbara where she studied psychology.  She earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology in 1995, but it was not until 1999 that she discovered she could effectively apply her expertise in human behavior indirectly.  It was in 1999 that she began working in human resources.
 
In 1999, Tawni Cranz began work at FedEx/Kinko’s as a Human Resources Generalist.  Almost immediately, Cranz exhibited a real aptitude for evaluating candidates and finding viable, hard-working individuals who would help meet the goals of Kinko’s.  For five years, Tawni Cranz developed and refined her abilities to become such an outstanding Human Resources manager that she drew the attention of Bausch & Lomb!  In 2004, Tawni Cranz made a lateral move to Bausch & Lomb as a Human Resources Generalist for the medical supply company.
 
When she went to work for Netflix, Tawni Cranz also went back to school!  While she worked as the Director of Human Resources, she was also studying at Claremont Graduate University.  She earned her MBA in Business in 2011 and Netflix rewarded her with a promotion!  Now as the Vice President of Talent at Netflix, Tawni Cranz combines her love of psychology with her training and experience in management and human resources to keep Netflix staffed with all the right people.
