Global Macro Strategy

What is a 'Global Macro Strategy'
A global macro strategy is a hedge fund or mutual fund strategy that bases its holdings, such as long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities and futures markets, primarily on the overall economic and political views of various countries, or their macroeconomic principles. For example, if a manager believes the United States is headed into recession, he might short sell stocks and futures contracts on major U.S. indices or the U.S. dollar, or seeing big opportunity for growth in Singapore, might take long positions in Singapore's assets.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Global Macro Strategy'
      Global macro funds build portfolios around predictions and projections of large-scale events on the country-wide, continental and global scale, implementing opportunistic investment strategies to capitalize on macroeconomic and geopolitical trends. Global macro funds are considered among the least restricted funds available as they generally place any type of trade they choose using almost any type of security available.General Global Macro Fund TypesThere are various generalized types of global macro funds that exist in 2016, most of which aim to profit on various systemic and market risk factors. Discretionary global macro funds construct portfolios at the asset class level based on a top-level view of the global markets. This type of global macro fund is considered the most flexible as managers can go long or short with any type of asset anywhere in the world.Commodity trading advisor (CTA) global macro funds use various investment products but instead of creating portfolios based on top-level views, these funds use price-based and trend-following algorithms to help construct portfolios and execute the fund's trades. Systematic global macro funds use fundamental analysis to build portfolios and execute trades using algorithms. This type of fund is essentially a hybrid of discretionary global macro and CTA funds.Global Macro StrategiesGlobal macro funds generally use a combination of currency-based, interest rate-based and stock index-based trading strategies. Within the context of currency strategies, the funds typically seek opportunities based on the relative strength of one currency to another. Funds monitor and project economic and monetary policies around the world and make highly leveraged currency trades using futures, forwards, options and spot transactions. Interest rate strategies usually invest in sovereign debt, making directional bets as well as relative value trades. Regarding stock index strategies, global macro funds make country-specific directional bets on market indices using futures, options and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Commodity index trades are also included in this category. Certain global macro funds employ strategies focused on only emerging market countries.

The Fund
Unconstrained to a traditional benchmark, this Fund is one of the industry's longest-running absolute return strategies. Implements a flexible approach to investing long and short in foreign markets, providing global exposure that may help counterbalance  performance swings in conventional holdings.



The Approach
Eaton Vance applies its global macroeconomic and political research process in directing Fund investments. This time-tested process informs long and short positions in sovereign asset classes, such as foreign currencies and sovereign credit markets. Mana gers consider relative risk and return in managing exposures.



The Features
A flexible mandate translates into investment opportunities in both improving and deteriorating markets. Historically has provided a low volatility, strong, risk-adjusted performance experience. Historically low beta may help the Fund complement traditio nal holdings. Managed by Eaton Vance, a global investing leader.







 

 OverviewRelative to traditional markets, historically this fund has had: lower volatility, limited drawdown and lower beta.1

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of Class A Shares reflects returns of the Global Macro Portfolio into which it invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect  any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particul ar industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, political, international and regulatory developments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate m ore than a fund with less exposure to such areas. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particul ar industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, political, international and regulatory developments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate m ore than a fund with less exposure to such areas. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter. Key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about Trump's pro-growth agenda, stronger European economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets.
Surveys of U.S. consumer and business confidence surged to multi-year highs on expectations that the new administration's policies would accelerate GDP growth. However, measures of "hard" economic activity, such as retail sales and capital spending, had  yet to show similar strength. At its mid-March policy meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its 2017 growth forecast at 2.1% but raised interest rates 0.25% as its preferred inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, neared th e central bank's 2% target. On March 31, the government reported that the PCE climbed at an annual pace of 2.1% in February — the first time it had exceeded 2% in nearly five years.
Outside the U.S., the U.K. economy remained resilient following the June 2016 "Brexit" vote, with unemployment falling to its lowest level since 1975. Eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region,  despite heightened political uncertainty. Emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors, including attractive valuations and a weakening in the U.S. dollar.
In this environment, the global equity market registered a strong gain, led by emerging markets. Returns were also positive — albeit more modest — for local currency and U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign debt, and for U.S. cre dit. The Treasury yield curve flattened, as short rates rose and long rates dipped slightly. Falling oil prices contributed to a loss in the broad commodity market.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund outperformed their benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch 3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the Index),2 at net asset value during the quarter.

By risk factor, currency exposure was the top contributor to Fund performance, followed by rates and sovereign credit. Commodity investments also gained, led by a short in oil. The equity sleeve had minimal impact on Global Macro Absolute Return Fund but  was a slight detractor in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. Corporate credit hurt performance for both Funds.
In terms of regions, Eastern Europe was the top contributor to Fund performance and Western Europe was the next-largest contributor. The favorable results in Eastern Europe were due to currency, sovereign credit and rates exposures, including long positi ons in the Russian ruble and Russian rates. Russia's economy has been recovering and inflation has fallen more quickly than expected, prompting the central bank to cut interest rates and signal more rate cuts in 2017. Long investments in Cypriot and Turk ish sovereign credit boosted returns in the region as well. In Western Europe, a strong gain from long exposure to the Icelandic krona versus the euro drove results in the region.
Latin America also positively impacted returns, helped by rates and sovereign credit exposures. Notable contributors included a long rates position in Colombia, where the central bank eased policy, and a long sovereign credit position in Brazil, where ec onomic improvement led a major ratings agency to raise its credit outlook on the country. The Dollar Bloc added a modest amount of value in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund; however, its performance was flat in Global Macro Absolute Return Fun d. Within the Dollar Bloc, a long in Australian rates was a plus, while a short in the Canadian dollar detracted.
Asia, as well as the Middle East and Africa region, dampened results. Although rates exposure was positive in Asia, the gain was overshadowed by currency investments, particularly a short in the Chinese yuan. Currency, rates and sovereign credit detracte d in the Middle East and Africa, including shorts in the Omani rial, Israeli rates and South African sovereign credit.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of Class A Shares reflects returns of the Global Macro Portfolio into which it invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect  any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's performance during the quarter:

At the individual position level, the long in the Icelandic krona versus the euro added significant value. Despite retreating in March, the krona strengthened against the euro over the full quarter amid a tourism boom in Iceland that is fueling strong ec onomic growth. Long investments in the Russian ruble and Turkish sovereign credit were also especially helpful. Other top contributors included long positions in the Colombian peso and Indonesian rupiah, which performed well amid broad U.S. dollar weakne ss. Following its rapid fourth-quarter rise, the dollar declined in response to concerns about how quickly Trump's pro-growth policies would be implemented given Congressional opposition.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's performance during the quarter:

Consistent with U.S. dollar weakness, the list of detractors was dominated by short currency positions. Chief among these were shorts in the Chinese yuan, Omani rial, euro and Mexican peso.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We expect a wide range of potential investment outcomes due to the change in U.S. political leadership. While markets appear to have priced in fiscal spending, lower taxes and less regulation, trade policy remains a key factor that will have a significan t impact on the global economy and the individual countries the team covers. Beyond the United States, China's capital account management and multiple European elections are likely to drive volatility in financial markets, and further consolidation in oi l markets may continue to stress those Middle East producers with inadequate fiscal capacity to absorb lower commodity prices. Against this backdrop, we have positioned the Funds to be more sensitive to country-level factors rather than broad macro facto rs as we expect country-level factors to be the main drivers of their performance going forward.
At quarter-end, both Funds' foreign currency positioning was net long. Long U.S. dollar and euro positions versus select emerging and frontier market currencies balance the risk.
Credit spread duration was slightly negative for both Funds. Long sovereign credit positions in Turkey, Cyprus and El Salvador were somewhat offset by short sovereign credit positions in South Africa and Qatar, in addition to short broad European corpora te credit exposure.
U.S. interest-rate duration and non-U.S. interest-rate duration were less than one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and near one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. A long position in New Zealand rates and a short in Saudi Ara bian rates were the larger duration contributors to overall interest-rate sensitivity.
