Medium Roast


Flavor Notes

Additional Info
This cooperative has been among the most inspiring groups to work with. With 180 members, and as of the coming harvest, two washing station sites, Biftu Gudina is stronger than ever. 49th Parallel has been working with Biftu Gudina from its inception in 2011, and there is a rock solid partnership we are both quite excited to continue. Agaro (the region Biftu Gudina resides in) is close to the birthplace of coffee and has some unique heirloom varieties growing in the forests.
The quality of current crop Biftu is exciting, with loads of a wild flower honey quality - so think bright, crisp, floral. The 2016 crop a special lot to be working within a year where much of the country lost its yields due to heavy rains - so please enjoy this one!






our beans





Single Origin Coffees
We use high-quality single-origin beans. Single-origin means all the beans in a batch came from the same farmer. We use single origin beans because they allow sharp and distinct flavors to come through in the coffee.
We rotate our coffees every couple months, so you get to try new flavors - with single origin beans, the coffee farms run out of a specific coffee & therefore we have to keep fresh “Green Coffee’s” coming in from our roasters each season.










Roast
We use coffees that are roasted on the lighter range of the spectrum. Again, lighter roasts preserve a lot of the distinct and interesting flavors instead of giving you that 'burnt' taste we all know too well.
We do not roast coffee ourselves. We work with a few premium roasters in the industry - 49th Parallel,  Ritual Roasters, and Saint Frank Coffee.




Brewing
Even with the best beans, a lot of the magic happens during brewing. Your barista is in charge of extracting the best elements from the beans to extract the coffees perfectly.
Well-brewed coffee is sweet and mellow, & reflects the characteristics of origin where the coffee is grown. However poorly brewing the same beans can result in sour and or bitter flavors.
We use a rigorous and consistent process to extract the best flavors out of our coffee.










Results
The combination of these aspects results in coffees that have special flavors. Depending on their origin you will get different notes. Coffees from East Africa typically have fruity notes such as blueberry or citrus while Central American coffees tend to be more chocolatey and round.
The flavors in our coffees are delicate and smooth due to the intense focus that is given to them throughout the whole process. The taste should never be burnt or bitter.
Our coffee is super smooth - no need cream and sugar.

The New York Times calls it  Instant Coffee You’ll Actually Want to Drink  and I'd have to agree. As a coffee snob, Kalle knows his shit — he's literally the 9th best coffee taster and 9th best barista in the world. 

I've been taking Sudden with me on trips and love it — it saves me from overroasted, charcoal-like coffee found at megabrands around the world, packs light, and most importantly, tastes great.

Subscriptions start at $24/month, and for a limited time, you can get 10% off FOR LIFE with my referral link.



Kalle has told me that he's only going to keep subscriptions open through this coming Monday because he's nearly at capacity, so I'd highly recommend you get in and lock in an early bird relationship. You'll thank me later. 22Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@chrismessina Thanks for hunting Chris! 7Share·a year agoTaylor Edmiston@kicksopenminds · Software Engineer @ Astronomer@chrismessina @kallefreese Hey Chris or Kalle, I'm excited about the launch and have been following since the early days.  The only objection I raised was that the price point was high (IIRC it was ~$5 per tube).  It looks like you've been able to bring it down a bit and I'm excited to try.

Can you comment on what the shelf life is considering it's pre-ground?  Have you tried using brewing methods like an AeroPress or french press besides just mixing it in a cup? 2Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@kicksopenminds @chrismessina We're now at $2.50-3 per cup depending on the plan 👌

The shelf life is much much longer. In the tubes ≈ 6 weeks and in the next version of fully sealed packaging easily 3-4 months. Do you mean brewing the coffee in Aeropress as in adding coffee + water? There will be barely anything left. 2Share·a year agoTaylor Edmiston@kicksopenminds · Software Engineer @ Astronomer@kallefreese @chrismessina That is what I meant, but perhaps a more interesting question is what brewing methods have / haven't worked for you to create Sudden?  I'm curious if by "hand crafted" you mean with a V60 etc or some other process to yield the "crystallized" coffee? 1Share·a year agoMax Engel@8bitkid · Creator of Awecelot, Co-founder of QuillI trust @chrismessina on all things coffee, and just locked-in a subscription today. I'm excited to keep some vials in my bag! Although, I'm going to have a tough time walking past my favorite NYC spots :-D 1Share·a year ago🌟 Chris MessinaHunter@chrismessina · 🏆 PH Community Member of the Year!@8bitkid yay! Of course, Sudden isn't meant to replace visiting great coffee shops — it's really about filling the gaps when your first choice might not be available (though it is a good enough product that you could use it as your primary coffee beverage if you preferred). UpvoteShare·a year agoMax Engel@8bitkid · Creator of Awecelot, Co-founder of Quill@chrismessina totally, I don't see it doing that. I instead see keeping vials in my travel bags, etc. when traveling or just out about without a place to get a good cup. UpvoteShare·a year agoAnton Bernstein@antonberI've been a subscriber since Sudden got started, and I'll vouch that the coffee is delicious and energizing. Highly recommend. 15Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@antonber Thanks Anton 💪🏻 2Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden CoffeeHey @rrhoover I deliver you a bunch of Sudden a month or two ago - how did you & the team like it? 12Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@rrhoover I guess Philz got the better of us 😁😸 UpvoteShare·a year agoMichael Molesky@mmolesky · Co-founder, CEO @ MarkerThe first time I tried Sudden Coffee was eye-opening - I took my first sip, and... right there was a shockingly good cup of coffee, like I had just made a pourover at home. It's been so much fun to share my subscription with friends; it really changes their preconceptions of what instant coffee can be. One question @kallefreese - what do you think are the best use cases for Sudden? I already take it with me on trips to avoid bad airplane coffee, but I'm sure you have plenty of other ideas. 11Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden CoffeeThanks @mmolesky! I never used to drink coffee at home in the mornings (ironic, right?). Now I take a cup of cold water, put it in the microwave for 90 sec and mix in one tube of coffee. It's just soooo easy and tasty. 1Share·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup AdviserI've tasted it, and it tastes awesome. Great convenience factor also 6Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@_jacksmith Thanks Jack. Which would be your ideal situation for Sudden? UpvoteShare·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@kallefreese I've tried it as a cold brew and as a hot brew.

Actually an ideal use case that I'd found is mixing it with ice cream. Previously I'd mixed ground coffee beans with icecream, but you end up with a weird texture and a sand-like consistency. Sudden Coffee is ideal for this usecase, as it actually dissolves really easily due to the different process of how it's made. 5Share·a year agoKalle FreeseMaker@kallefreese · Co-Founder at Sudden Coffee@_jacksmith Agree that it's super delicious with ice cream 🍦⚡️ UpvoteShare·a year agoView more comments👋 Welcome to Product HuntGet the best new products in your inbox, daily.SubscribeRelated ProductsGO CUBES Chewable CoffeeKeep your coffee in your pocket instead of a cupCraft CoffeeThe World's best coffee delivered to your doorstepPower ToothpasteThe 1st caffeinated toothpaste.
