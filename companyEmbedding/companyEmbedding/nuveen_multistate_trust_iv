Example  The following example
is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do not redeem your
shares at the end of a period. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your
costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover  The Fund pays transaction
costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable
account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 9% of the average value of its
portfolio.  Principal Investment Strategies  Under normal market
conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and Ohio personal income tax. These municipal
bonds include obligations issued by the State of Ohio and its subdivisions, authorities, instrumentalities and corporations, as well as obligations issued by U.S. territories (such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) that pay interest
that is exempt from regular federal and Ohio personal income tax. The Fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax. The Fund will generally maintain, under normal market conditions, an
investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of 10 years.  Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net
assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated BBB/Baa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency, or, if unrated, judged by the Funds sub-adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 20% of
its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds, commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds.  The Fund may invest in all types
of municipal bonds, including general obligation bonds, revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases. The Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds, which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash
income to their holders until they mature.  The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with
changes in short-term tax-exempt interest rates (inverse floaters). Inverse floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds. The Funds investments in inverse floaters are
designed to increase the Funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure. These investments are speculative, however, and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished. 
The Fund may utilize futures contracts, swap contracts, options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk, credit risk and
yield curve risk, and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the Funds portfolio.  The Funds sub-adviser uses a value-oriented
strategy and looks for higher-yielding and undervalued long-term municipal bonds that offer above-average total return. The sub-adviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other
available bonds.  Principal Risks  The price and yield of this Fund will
change daily. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation or any other government agency. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, listed alphabetically, include: 
Alternative Minimum Tax RiskThe Fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds. Therefore, all or a portion of the
Funds otherwise exempt-interest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.  Call RiskIf an
issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the Fund, performance could be adversely impacted.  Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that an
issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such
payments. The Funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the Funds credit risk.  Credit Spread RiskCredit spread risk is the risk
that credit spreads (i.e., the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality) may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default. Increasing credit spreads may
reduce the market values of the Funds debt securities. Credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities. In addition, when credit spreads increase, reductions in market
value will generally be greater for longer-maturity securities.  Cybersecurity RiskCybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to gain
access to Fund assets, customer data, or proprietary information, or cause the Fund and/or its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality. 
Derivatives RiskThe use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the Fund in a worse position than if it had not
used these instruments. Derivative instruments can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset. These instruments may entail investment exposures that are
greater than their cost would suggest. As a result, a small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value. An over-the-counter
derivative transaction between the Fund and a counterparty that is not cleared through a central counterparty also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required
payments. The payment obligation for a cleared derivative transaction is guaranteed by a central counterparty, which exposes the Fund to the creditworthiness of the central counterparty. 
High Yield Securities RiskHigh yield securities, which are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds, are high risk
investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund. They generally have greater credit risk, are less liquid and have more volatile prices than investment grade securities. 
Income RiskThe Funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates or when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds.
Also, if the Fund invests in inverse floaters, the Funds income may decrease if short-term interest rates rise.  Interest Rate RiskInterest rate
risk is the risk that the value of the Funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. The Fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically
low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates change, the values of longer-duration debt securities usually change more than the values of
shorter-duration debt securities. Interest rate risk may be increased by the Funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments. 
Inverse Floaters RiskThe use of inverse floaters by the Fund creates effective leverage. Due to the leveraged nature of these investments, they will
typically be more volatile and involve greater risk than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters. An investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original principal
investment. Distributions on inverse floaters bear an inverse relationship to short-term municipal bond interest rates. Thus, distributions paid to the Fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as short-term municipal interest
rates rise and will increase when short-term municipal interest rates fall. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment. 
Municipal Bond Market Liquidity RiskInventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, lessening their ability to
make a market in these securities. This reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds, and increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or
market stress. In addition, recent federal

banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds, which may further decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds. As a result, the Fund may be
forced to accept a lower price to sell a security, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. If the Fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise
cash (such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions), those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance.  Municipal Lease Obligations
RiskParticipation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain non-appropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under
the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body.  Municipal Securities RiskThe values of
municipal securities held by the Fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments. Adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly adverse effect on the
financial condition of local issuers. Because the Fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from Ohio or U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the Fund is more susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond
issuers in those locations. Certain municipal bond issuers in Puerto Rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades.  Tax
RiskIncome from municipal bonds held by the Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant
conduct of a bond issuer. Investments in certain derivatives utilized by the Fund may cause the Fund to have taxable investment income.  Valuation
RiskThe debt securities in which the Fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of market-based inputs and assumptions, including readily available market quotations obtained from broker-dealers making markets
in such instruments, cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the pricing service, which could result in a loss to the
Fund. Pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but some trades may occur in smaller, odd lot sizes, often at lower prices than institutional round
lot trades. Different pricing services may incorporate different assumptions and inputs into their valuation methodologies, potentially resulting in different values for the same securities. As a result, if the Fund were to change pricing services,
or if the Funds pricing service were to change its valuation methodology, there could be a material impact, either positive or negative, on the Funds net asset value. 
Zero Coupon Bonds RiskZero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall. In addition, while
such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards, they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the Fund to be forced to liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash, as required by
tax laws.  Fund Performance  The following bar chart and table provide
some indication of the potential risks of investing in the Fund. The Funds past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at
www.nuveen.com/performance or by calling (800) 257-8787.  The bar chart below shows the variability of the Funds performance from year to year for
Class A shares. The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns that follow do not reflect sales charges, and if these charges were reflected, the returns would be less than those shown. 
Class A Annual Total Return*

The performance of the other share classes will differ due to their different expense structures.

During the ten-year period ended December 31, 2016, the Funds highest
and lowest quarterly returns were 8.00% and -4.22%, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2010.  The table below shows the
variability of the Funds average annual returns and how they compare over the time periods indicated with those of a broad measure of market performance and an index of funds with similar investment objectives. All after-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax
returns are shown for Class A shares only; after-tax returns for other share classes will vary. Your own actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from what
is shown here.  Both the bar chart and the table assume that all distributions have been reinvested. Performance reflects fee waivers, if any, in effect during the
periods presented. If any such waivers had not been in place, returns would have been reduced.  Prior to February 10, 2014, Class C2 shares were designated
Class C shares.  Performance is not shown for Class T shares, which have not been offered for a full calendar year.

Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares 
You may purchase, redeem or exchange shares of the Fund on any business day, which is any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. You may purchase, redeem
or exchange shares of the Fund either through a financial advisor or other financial intermediary or directly from the Fund. Class C2 shares are available only through exchanges from other Nuveen Municipal Bond Funds and dividend reinvestments by
current Class C2 shareholders. Class C and Class T shares may not be purchased directly from the Fund. In addition, the availability of Class A, Class C and Class T shares through a financial intermediary will depend on the policies of the
intermediary. The Funds initial and subsequent investment minimums generally are as follows, although certain financial intermediaries may impose their own investment minimums and the Fund may reduce or waive the minimums in some cases: 
 








  
    
Class A, Class C and Class T
  
Class I

Eligibility and Minimum Initial Investment
    
$3,000 (Class T shares are not available through fee-based programs.)
  
 Available only through fee-based programs and to other limited categories of investors as described in the
prospectus.   $100,000 for all accounts except:
   $250 for clients of financial intermediaries and
family offices that have accounts holding Class I shares with an aggregate value of at least $100,000 (or that are expected to reach this level).  
 No minimum for certain other categories of eligible investors as described in the prospectus.

Minimum Additional Investment
    
$100
  
No minimum.
 Tax Information  The Fund intends to make
interest income distributions that are exempt from regular federal and Ohio state income tax. However, all or a portion of these distributions may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. In addition, a portion of the Funds
distributions may be subject to regular federal and Ohio state income tax.  Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank or financial advisor), the Fund, its distributor or its
investment adviser may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the
Fund over another investment. Ask your financial advisor or visit your financial intermediarys website for more information.

Example  The
following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do
not redeem your shares at the end of a period. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these
assumptions your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover  The Fund
pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held
in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the average
value of its portfolio. 
Principal Investment Strategies  Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular
federal and Wisconsin personal income tax. These municipal bonds include obligations issued by the State of Wisconsin and its subdivisions, authorities, instrumentalities and corporations, as well as obligations issued by U.S. territories (such as
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and Wisconsin personal income tax. The Fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax. The
Fund will generally maintain, under normal market conditions, an investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of 10 years. 
Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated BBB/Baa or higher at the time of purchase
by at least one independent rating agency, or, if unrated, judged by the Funds sub-adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds, commonly referred to as
high yield or junk bonds.  The Fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds, including general obligation bonds, revenue bonds
and participation interests in municipal leases. The Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds, which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature. 
The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in short-term tax-exempt interest rates
(inverse floaters). Inverse floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds. The Funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the Funds income and
returns through this leveraged exposure. These investments are speculative, however, and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished.  The Fund may utilize futures contracts, swap contracts, options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk, credit risk and yield curve risk, and to manage the effective
maturity or duration of securities in the Funds portfolio.  The Funds sub-adviser uses a value-oriented strategy and looks for
higher-yielding and undervalued long-term municipal bonds that offer above-average total return. The sub-adviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds.

Principal Risks 
The price and yield of this Fund will change daily. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, listed alphabetically, include:  Alternative Minimum Tax RiskThe Fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds. Therefore, all or a portion of the Funds otherwise exempt-interest
dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.  Call RiskIf an issuer calls higher-yielding
debt instruments held by the Fund, performance could be adversely impacted.  Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt
security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments. The
Funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the Funds credit risk.  Credit Spread RiskCredit spread risk is the risk
that credit spreads (i.e., the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality) may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default. Increasing credit spreads may
reduce the market values of the Funds securities. Credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities. In addition, when credit spreads increase, reductions in market value
will generally be greater for longer-maturity securities.  Cybersecurity RiskCybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to
gain access to Fund assets, customer data, or proprietary information, or cause the Fund and/or its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality.  Derivatives RiskThe use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the Fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments. Derivative instruments
can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset. These instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest. As a result, a
small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value. A derivative transaction also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a
result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments.  High Yield Securities RiskHigh yield securities, which
are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds, are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund. They generally have greater credit risk, are less liquid and have more volatile
prices than investment grade securities.  Income RiskThe Funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Also, if
the Fund invests in inverse floaters, the Funds income may decrease if short-term interest rates rise.  Interest Rate RiskInterest
rate risk is the risk that the value of the Funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. The Fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of
historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates change, the values of longer-duration debt securities usually change more than the values
of shorter-duration debt securities. Interest rate risk may be increased by the Funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments.  Inverse Floaters RiskThe use of inverse floaters by the Fund creates effective leverage. Due to the leveraged nature of these investments, they will typically be more volatile and involve greater risk
than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters. An investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original principal investment. Distributions on inverse floaters bear an
inverse relationship to short-term municipal bond interest rates. Thus, distributions paid to the Fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as short-term municipal interest rates rise and will increase when short-term municipal
interest rates fall. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment. 
Municipal Bond Market Liquidity RiskInventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, lessening their ability
to make a market in these securities. This reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds, and increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic
or market stress. In addition, recent federal

banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds, which may further decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds. As a result, the Fund may be
forced to accept a lower price to sell a security, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. If the Fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise
cash (such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions), those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance.  Municipal Lease
Obligations RiskParticipation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain non-appropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future
payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body.  Political and Economic
RisksThe values of municipal securities held by the Fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments. Adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly
adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers. Because the Fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from Wisconsin or U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the Fund is more susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory
changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations. Certain municipal bond issuers in Puerto Rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades.  Tax RiskIncome from municipal bonds held by the Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service
or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer. Investments in certain derivatives utilized by the Fund may cause the Fund to have taxable investment income.  Valuation RiskThe debt securities in which the Fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of market-based inputs and assumptions, including readily available market
quotations obtained from broker-dealers making markets in such instruments, cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the
pricing service, which could result in a loss to the Fund. Pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but some trades may occur in smaller, odd lot
sizes, often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades.  Zero Coupon Bonds RiskZero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current
basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall. In addition, while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards, they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the Fund to be forced to
liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash, as required by tax laws.  Fund Performance 
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of investing in the Fund. The Funds past performance (before and after taxes)
is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at www.nuveen.com/performance or by calling (800) 257-8787. 
The bar chart below shows the variability of the Funds performance from year to year for Class A shares. The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns

During the ten-year period ended December 31, 2014, the Funds
highest and lowest quarterly returns were 7.86% and -5.23%, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008.  The
table below shows the variability of the Funds average annual returns and how they compare over the time periods indicated with those of a broad measure of market performance and an index of funds with similar investment objectives. All after-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax
returns are shown for Class A shares only; after-tax returns for other share classes will vary. Your own actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from what
is shown here.  Both the bar chart and the table assume that all distributions have been reinvested. Performance reflects fee waivers, if any, in effect
during the periods presented. If any such waivers had not been in place, returns would have been reduced.  Prior to February 10, 2014, Class C2
shares were designated Class C shares.  Performance is not shown for Class C shares, which have not been offered for a full calendar year.

	Example





	The
	following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do
	not redeem your shares at the end of a period. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these
	assumptions your costs would be:

	Portfolio Turnover





	The Fund
	pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held
	in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 16% of the average
	value of its portfolio.








	Principal Investment Strategies





	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular
	federal and Ohio personal income tax. These municipal bonds include obligations issued by the State of Ohio and its subdivisions, authorities, instrumentalities and corporations, as well as obligations issued by U.S. territories (such as Puerto
	Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal and Ohio personal income tax. The Fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax. The Fund will
	generally maintain, under normal market conditions, an investment portfolio with an overall weighted average maturity in excess of 10 years.




	Under
	normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated BBB/Baa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency, or, if unrated, judged by the Funds
	sub-adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds, commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds.




	The Fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds, including general obligation bonds, revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases. The Fund may
	invest in zero coupon bonds, which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature.




	The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in short-term tax-exempt interest rates (

	inverse floaters

	). Inverse
	floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds. The Funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the Funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure. These
	investments are speculative, however, and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished.




	The Fund may utilize futures
	contracts, swap contracts, options on futures contracts and options on swap contracts in an attempt to manage market risk, credit risk and yield curve risk, and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the Funds portfolio.




	The Funds sub-adviser uses a value-oriented strategy and looks for higher-yielding and undervalued long-term municipal bonds that offer
	above-average total return. The sub-adviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds.

	Principal Risks





	The price and yield of this Fund will change daily. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not
	insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, listed alphabetically, include:





	Alternative Minimum Tax Risk

	The Fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative minimum tax bonds. Therefore, all or a portion of the Funds otherwise exempt-interest
	dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.





	Call Risk

	If an issuer calls higher-yielding
	debt instruments held by the Fund, performance could be adversely impacted.





	Credit Risk

	Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt
	security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments. The
	Funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the Funds credit risk.





	Credit Spread Risk

	Credit spread risk is the risk
	that credit spreads (i.e., the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality) may increase when the market believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default. Increasing credit spreads may
	reduce the market values of the Funds securities. Credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for investment grade securities. In addition, when credit spreads increase, reductions in market value
	will generally be greater for longer-maturity securities.





	Cybersecurity Risk

	Cybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to
	gain access to Fund assets, customer data, or proprietary information, or cause the Fund and/or its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality.





	Derivatives Risk

	The use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction costs which could leave the Fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments. Derivative instruments
	can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or asset. These instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest. As a result, a
	small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value. A derivative transaction also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a
	result of the failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments.





	High Yield Securities Risk

	High yield securities, which
	are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds, are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund. They generally have greater credit risk, are less liquid and have more volatile
	prices than investment grade securities.





	Income Risk

	The Funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Also, if
	the Fund invests in inverse floaters, the Funds income may decrease if short-term interest rates rise.





	Interest Rate Risk

	Interest
	rate risk is the risk that the value of the Funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. The Fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of
	historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates change, the values of longer-duration debt securities usually change more than the values
	of shorter-duration debt securities. Interest rate risk may be increased by the Funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments.





	Inverse Floaters Risk

	The use of inverse floaters by the Fund creates effective leverage. Due to the leveraged nature of these investments, they will typically be more volatile and involve greater risk
	than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters. An investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original principal investment. Distributions on inverse floaters bear an
	inverse relationship to short-term municipal bond interest rates. Thus, distributions paid to the Fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as short-term municipal interest rates rise and will increase when short-term municipal
	interest rates fall. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment.





	Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk

	Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, lessening their ability
	to make a market in these securities. This reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds, and increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic
	or market stress. In addition, recent federal




	 














	Nuveen Investments

	banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds, which may further decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds. As a result, the Fund may be
	forced to accept a lower price to sell a security, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. If the Fund needed to sell large blocks of bonds to raise
	cash (such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions), those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance.





	Municipal Lease
	Obligations Risk

	Participation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain non-appropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future
	payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body.





	Political and Economic
	Risks

	The values of municipal securities held by the Fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and developments. Adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly
	adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers. Because the Fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from Ohio or U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the Fund is more susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory changes
	affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations. Certain municipal bond issuers in Puerto Rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades.





	Tax Risk

	Income from municipal bonds held by the Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service
	or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer. Investments in certain derivatives utilized by the Fund may cause the Fund to have taxable investment income.





	Valuation Risk

	The debt securities in which the Fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of market-based inputs and assumptions, including readily available market
	quotations obtained from broker-dealers making markets in such instruments, cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the
	pricing service, which could result in a loss to the Fund. Pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but some trades may occur in smaller, odd lot
	sizes, often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades.





	Zero Coupon Bonds Risk

	Zero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current
	basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall. In addition, while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards, they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the Fund to be forced to
	liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash, as required by tax laws.








	Fund Performance





	The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of investing in the Fund. The Funds past performance (before and after taxes)
	is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at www.nuveen.com/performance or by calling (800) 257-8787.




	The bar chart below shows the variability of the Funds performance from year to year for Class A shares. The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns that follow do not reflect sales charges, and
	if these charges were reflected, the returns would be less than those shown.

	During the

	ten-year

	period ended December 31, 2014, the Funds
	highest and lowest quarterly returns were 8.00% and

	-4.22%, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2010.




	The table
	below shows the variability of the Funds average annual returns and how they compare over the time periods indicated with those of a broad measure of market performance and an index of funds with similar investment objectives. All

	after-tax

	returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.

	After-tax

	returns are shown for Class A shares only;

	after-tax

	returns for other share classes will vary. Your own actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from what
	is shown here.




	Both the bar chart and the table assume that all distributions have been reinvested. Performance reflects fee waivers, if any, in effect
	during the periods presented. If any such waivers had not been in place, returns would have been reduced.




	Prior to February 10, 2014, Class C2
	shares were designated Class C shares.

3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
