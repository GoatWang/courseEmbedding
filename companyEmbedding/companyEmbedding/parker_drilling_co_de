In a 2008 correspondence with Parker Drilling Company, the SEC requested more details to be disclosed regarding their investments in Iran:
“We are aware of various news reports indicating that since 2003 you have been engaged in drilling wells at Korpeje in Turkmenistan, from where natural gas is exported by pipeline to Iran. Your Form 10-K does not include disclosure regarding any contacts with Iran, a country identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism, and subject to U.S. economic sanctions and export controls. Please describe to us the nature and extent of your past, current, and anticipated contacts with Iran, if any, whether through direct or indirect arrangements. Your response should describe in reasonable detail any components, equipment, technology, or other products or services you have provided into Iran, and any agreements, commercial arrangements, or other contacts you have had with the government of Iran or entities controlled by that government.” (UPLOAD for PARKER DRILLING CO DE, 7/8/2008)
Parker Drilling responded:
"Pursuant to a recent internal review, we (Parker Drilling Co.) have preliminarily identified certain shipments of equipment and supplies that were routed through Iran. In addition, we have engaged in drilling wells in the Korpedje Field in Turkmenistan, from where natural gas may be exported by pipeline to Iran. We are currently reviewing these shipments and drilling activities to determine whether the timing, nature and extent of such shipments or drilling activities may have given rise to violations of these laws and regulations." (10-Q for PARKER DRILLING CO DE, 8/11/2008)
"Yesterday, we disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, which we timely filed with the Commission, that we are conducting an internal review relating to (a) certain shipments of equipment and supplies that were routed through Iran and (b) the drilling of wells in Korpeje Field in Turkmenistan, from where gas may be exported by pipeline to Iran. As described in our Form 10-Q, concurrent with the filing of our Form 10-Q we voluntarily disclosed the status of our current review of these matters to the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. This disclosure, which appears in three separate places in the Form 10-Q, is excerpted below." (CORRESP for PARKER DRILLING CO DE, 8/12/2008)
"Pursuant to an internal review, we have identified certain shipments of equipment and supplies that were routed through Iran as well as other activities that may have violated applicable U.S. laws and regulations. In addition, we have engaged in drilling wells in the Korpedje Field in Turkmenistan, from where natural gas may be exported by pipeline to Iran." (10-K for PARKER DRILLING CO DE, 3/3/2010)

The CEO (owner) at the time I started was very personable and made every employee feel important to the company. Great pay/compensation, reported to good management and free coffee/snacks.ConsNew CEO was not approachable. Layoffs were not always about budget or organizational strategy, but rather about favoritism. Trust was not present between workforce and management. Extremely high attrition, even before layoffs started. Did not aggressively address issues in management when reported by employees. Core values were not displayed or demonstrated throughout Parker.Advice to ManagementPeople are your number one asset, especially in a small company that is in a competitive industry. Trust and integrity should always be part of your core values and everyone, including management should be held accountable to these values. Have programs in place for all employees that motivate them and provide effective training to develop them. Don't be afraid to do employee surveys and learn from the results.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Parker Drilling Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Parker Drilling 2017-04-10 04:39 PDT Feb 2, 2017"Fulltime manager"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Houston, TXFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Houston, TXDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Parker Drilling full-time (More than 3 years)ProsFree Snacks, office location, paid parkingConsCulture, Turnover, poor HR, lack of growthAdvice to ManagementPick it up, know the value of those you haveShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Parker Drilling Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Parker Drilling 2017-02-02 11:14 PST Jan 12, 2017"Derrickhand"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendI worked at Parker Drilling full-time (More than a year)ProsGood breakout company, good insurance, 401k, would only recommend if you've never worked offshore to get experience they have good foodConsLow pay, sorry upper management don't care about employees, they are cheap don't want to give raises or buy things the employees need on rigAdvice to ManagementBe a little more caring about employees considering they are the ones doing all the work while you draw the big paycheckShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Parker Drilling Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Parker Drilling 2017-01-12 22:30 PST Dec 24, 2016"Former employer"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Executive Assistant in Houston, TXFormer Employee - Executive Assistant in Houston, TXRecommendsApproves of CEOI worked at Parker Drilling full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat company and people.

I observed that some of the company working procedures were not documented. This can be a con because it makes it difficult to learn the process as a new employee, however, it also allows for the procedure to be flexible in case room is needed for improvement.Advice to ManagementContinue to invest in the development of the documentation department as you have done.
