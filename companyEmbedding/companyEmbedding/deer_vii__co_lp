Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Seagate Technology PLC stock: 
1. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Jun Q results disappoint as surveillance HDD faces a digestion period; most of gross margin miss due to component pricing in ~$100M/quarter ODM portion of business. Below consensus September quarter guidance may not represent the bottom of current down-cycle as digestion periods often last longer than a quarter." (7/26/2017)
2. Benchmark Co. analysts commented, "Weakness was noted in OEM sales, possibly driven by ODM sales. Weakness was also noted with certain mission critical customers. Performance was termed disappointing in the high capacity, >8TB, nearline market. The NSA, surveillance, and China nearline CSP markets were all termed weak." (7/25/2017)
3. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Seagate's mixed third-quarter fiscal 2017 results reflected the company's focus on improving profitability by not getting involved into lower-margin businesses. Moreover, we believe that new product launches will help it to win enterprise customers on a continuous basis. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release. The company has positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. Further, improving PC shipment – per latest data from Gartner and IDC – bodes well for Seagate. In this regard, strong demand for hybrid drives also augurs well for the company. However, intensifying competition is a major headwind. We note that the company has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer Storage Devices industry on a year-to-date basis." (7/25/2017)
4. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "occur at a sluggish pace" or at the expense of growth (see Moskowitz's track record here).Second, Seagate is facing intense competition from Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: WDC), which is gaining share in the high-margin enterprise drive segment. Meanwhile, Seagate is struggling to reach high yields and fully qualify its 10TB and 12TB high capacity drives as management likely under-invested in the space.Finally, the likelihood of a Western Digital merger with Toshiba Memory seems more likely now than it has in the past. This could decouple Western Digital from Seagate as a traditional HDD company and could result in investors rotating out of Seagate and into Western Digital.Bottom line the analyst noted that the downgrade is company-specific in nature as the ongoing concerns could "limit Seagate's relative lift from stronger end markets." (7/13/2017)
5. FBN Securities analysts commented, "We are raising our rating on STX from Sector Perform to Outperform and increasing our PT from $38 to $55. Under excellent execution over the past year, the company has successfully (and impressively) improved key financial metrics. For example, gross margin of 31.8% last quarter improved by over 600bp Y/Y and is now at the high-end of the company's LT target of 27-32%, NG opex of $457M grew by only 1% Y/Y as headcount of 44,882 declined by 10% (5,166) Y/Y, and NG operating margin of 16.0% grew by 5.5pp Y/Y. Importantly, the company's free cash flow of $561M more than doubled Y/Y, resulting in a TTM FCF yield of 9% with the stock price near $46 (around the current level). Note that even though the company expects its C2015 NG EPS to be at least $4.50, we are getting C2015 NG EPS of $5.10 (some 13% higher). Additionally, even though the stock has made a strong move over the past year, shares are still quite a bit below the late C2014 high of almost $70. STX also offers an attractive dividend as its quarterly dividend of $.63/share results in an annualized dividend yield of ~5-6%." (1/25/2017)
