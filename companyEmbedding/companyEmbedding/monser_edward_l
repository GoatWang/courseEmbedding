            Edward L. Monser IV    
    










Edward L. Monser has served as chief operating officer (COO) of Emerson since 2001 and was named to the additional position of president in October 2010.
Monser is responsible for Emerson’s day-to-day business operations and leads the company’s profit review and other strategic planning processes. He also directs the company’s demand-driven supply chain, lean manufacturing, and international business activities, which include business development and investments in emerging markets.  Monser has more than 30 years of experience in senior operational positions at Emerson and has played key roles in globalizing the company.
From 1996 until becoming COO, Monser was president of Emerson’s Rosemount business unit. Under his leadership, Rosemount developed a range of innovative “smart” measurement and analytical devices for the process industry, expanded its service and solutions capabilities, and implemented significant operational efficiencies.
Monser began his career as a senior engineer at Rosemount in 1981. After serving in several engineering management positions, he was named Rosemount’s director of technology in 1987. Two years later, he became director of new products and technology. Monser went on to hold vice president positions overseeing several critical operations at Rosemount before becoming its executive vice president and general manager, and then president.
