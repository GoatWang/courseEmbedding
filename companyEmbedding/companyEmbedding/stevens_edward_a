Life on Campus
Our Location
Learning at Stevens
Our Legacy










Go Ducks!

School pride is on display when our scholar-athletes are at home competing. Individual and team accomplishments at national tournaments, including NCAA championships, have contributed to our profile and reputation. 











Passionate About the Arts

Stevens' performing arts community encourages all students to participate in the arts – music, theater and dance –  onstage or behind the scenes. A scene from "The Money Song", featured in a production of The World Goes Round. 

















Celebrating Diversity

Our students come from around the world, adding to the richness of campus culture with their unique heritage. The annual Unity Show features performances – music, drama and dance – celebrating student culture and heritage. 











Inviting and Inspiring

Stevens' beautiful campus directly facing Manhattan offers plenty of scenic spots to meet up with friends, or to simply take a moment of reflection in between classes. 











Bon Appétit!

A variety of campus eateries offer plenty of options to enjoy a meal or a coffee break with fellow students in a comfortable setting. Some even have Hudson River views! 











Fun and Games

Our students are academically focused, but they always find time to organize a volleyball game, play Frisbee on the lawn, engage in a friendly tug of war competition, and so much more. 











Greek Life

Members of the 16 Greek-Letter organizations at Stevens form life-long networks of brothers or sisters, and strive to live up to their common values and the university’s principles to community, leadership and scholarship. 



















Hit the Town

Washington Street is Hoboken's main artery, constantly buzzing with people taking advantage of the lively restaurants and shops that line the street. 











Enjoy the View

Across the river from Manhattan, Castle Point offers some of the most breath-taking views of New York City's iconic skyline. 











Going Green

Slightly removed from the bustle of the city, the university sits on 55 acres along the Hudson River waterfront with plenty of tranquil green space. 











Lackawanna Marks the Spot

The Lackawanna clock tower rises above Hoboken Terminal, a major transportation hub offering access to multiple rail lines, PATH trains, buses and ferries. 











Access to Opportunity

Our location on the Hudson River speaks to our maritime tradition and expertise, and our proximity to New York City offers a gateway to career and entrepreneurial opportunities in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education and entertainment. 











On the Move

With the dependable PATH train just a short walk from campus, getting to New York City is a breeze. 











A Nod to the Past

The Stevens campus is dotted with historic buildings and structures that are reminders of the proud legacy of the university's founding family. The Gatehouse (pictured) once served as the entrance to the Stevens family residence – a 40-room Victorian mansion knows as the "Stevens Castle." 













Bright Ideas

Stevens student teams designed & built the prize-winning SURE HOUSE Solar Home entirely on the Stevens campus. 











Dream Team

Courses at Stevens emphasize teamwork, small groups, hands-on projects and interactive learning. 











Immerse Yourself

Stevens' Immersion Lab displays complex data on large-format monitors. 

















Exponential Innovation

A Stevens education culminates in a Senior Design Project and Innovation Expo featuring mind-blowing student research. 











Analyze This

The Hanlon Financial Systems Lab features a simulated Wall Street trading room equipped with Bloomberg terminals and state-of-the-art analytics software. 











Move it

The Motion Capture Lab captures and translates movement for game design, animation and other purposes. 











The Fine Print

Stevens' PROOF prototyping lab is equipped with eight 3D printers. 











Linked In

Stevens' unique curriculum teaches entrepreneurship from day one and offers numerous  internships with fast tracks to top careers. 











The Sounds Of Science

Music technology professors Rob Harari and Carlos Alomar create experimental music with students in Stevens' music technology lab. 













Trailblazing Economist

Wharton School professor Elizabeth E. Bailey M.S. '66 was the first female doctoral candidate in economics at Princeton and first female commissioner of the Civil Aeronautics Board. 











Grandfather of the Internet

David J. Farber '56 M.S. '61 Hon. D.Eng. '99 helped design and build the original backbone of the internet. 











Leading SWE

Inventor and engineering executive Beatrice A. Hicks M.S. '49 was elected as the first president of the national Society of Women Engineers in 1950. 











Industry Leader

Sang-Beom Han M.S. '85 Ph.D. '91 is chief executive officer and vice chairman of LG Display, the world’s largest LCD panel maker. 











Nobel Laureate

Frederick Reines '39 M.S. '41 won the 1995 Nobel Prize for Physics for the first detection of the neutrino, a subatomic particle whose detection is a keystone to understanding elementary particle physics. 











Literary Lion

Richard Reeves '60 Hon. D.Eng. '87 is an author, presidential biographer, historian, teacher, political commentator and award-winning telejournalist. 











NASA Visionary

During a NASA career that spanned three decades, Aaron Cohen M.S. '58 Hon. D.Eng. '82 served as director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston and held a variety of key leadership roles crucial to the success of the Apollo Program.  











Charting Progress

Henry L. Gantt, Class of 1884, developed the Gantt chart, a bar chart for tracking construction project schedules that’s an industry mainstay still in wide use today. 











Automotive Pioneer
