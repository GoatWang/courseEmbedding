Waters Corporation Announces Christopher J. O'Connell as Chief 
      Executive Officer






June 25, 2015 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MILFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Waters 
      Corporation (NYSE:WAT) today announced that Christopher J. O'Connell 
      has been appointed as its new President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
      and member of its Board of Directors, effective in September 2015. Chris 
      joins Waters® from Medtronic plc.
    


      "From the outset, Waters' Board of Directors focused on identifying a 
      new CEO whose experience best supports the continuation of Waters' 
      culture, business strategies and performance drivers," explained Thomas 
      P. Salice, Lead Director for Waters Corporation. "Chris O'Connell's wide 
      range of experiences across all aspects of a technology focused global 
      organization prepares him well for the Waters CEO position. Through the 
      process of getting to know him, we found a leader who reflects Waters' 
      core values in addition to being an extremely motivated, thoughtful and 
      engaging person. We are confident Chris is the right person to continue 
      to drive Waters’ leadership performance and chart its future direction."
    

      "I am thrilled to join Waters Corporation," said Mr. O'Connell. "Not 
      only am I excited to enter an industry that enables its customers to 
      advance and push the limits of science, but I’m very proud to join the 
      industry's technology and customer support leader, and to be given the 
      opportunity to lead a remarkable group of people.”
    

      Over his 21 years at Medtronic, Chris O'Connell held a variety of 
      leadership positions, most recently as president of the Restorative 
      Therapies Group responsible for $7 billion in revenue and more than 
      16,000 employees worldwide. He provided overall strategic direction and 
      operational management of the Group’s five divisions, as well as led the 
      integration of the Group’s activities within the overall strategy of the 
      corporation. Chris earned a Bachelor’s degree from Northwestern 
      University and a Master’s degree in Business Administration from Harvard 
      University.
    

      Retiring CEO, Douglas A. Berthiaume will continue in his role as 
      Chairman of Waters' Board of Directors. All other leadership positions 
      within Waters will remain in place with their continued focus on 
      executing the Company’s growth strategies.
    

      "With this leadership transition, it is important to recognize Doug 
      Berthiaume for all that he accomplished as Waters' President, CEO and 
      Chairman of the Board," said Mr. Salice. "As the leading architect of 
      the company's focused business strategy, Doug oversaw Waters’ drive to 
      expand applications of our core technologies and commitment to customer 
      relationships. Impressively, the corporation has experienced a 35-fold 
      increase in share value since Doug led the effort taking the company 
      public in November 1995. We offer our heartfelt gratitude to Doug and 
      look forward to his continued role as Chairman."
