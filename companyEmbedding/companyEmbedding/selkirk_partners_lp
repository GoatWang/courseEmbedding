Selkirk Cogen Partners, LP


Selkirk Cogen Partners, LP
Location:  Selkirk, New York
Owner:  Multiple
Electric Customer:  NY Merchant Market (NYISO)
Thermal Customer:  SABIC
PURENERGY Roles:  Asset Manager and Operator
Services Provided:   Operating Services
Size:  418 MW
Fuel:  Natural Gas
Equipment:  The facility includes three (3) Frame 7EA gas turbine generator sets and two (2) steam turbine generator sets manufactured by the General Electric Company.
Description:  The Facility is a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, which has a total electric generating capacity in excess of 418 megawatts (“MW”) with a maximum average steam output of 400,000 pounds per hour (“lbs/hr”). The Facility consists of one unit (“Unit 1”) with an electric generating capacity of approximately 90 MW and a second unit (“Unit 2”) with an electric generating capacity of approximately 328 MW.  The Facility uses natural gas as its primary fuel input to produce electric energy for sale to the New York Independent System Operator (“NY ISO”) and to produce useful thermal energy in the form of steam for sale to SABIC for industrial purposes. The Facility is a “topping-cycle cogeneration facility,” which means that when the Facility is operated in a combined-cycle mode, it uses natural gas or fuel oil to produce electricity, and the reject heat from power production is then used to provide steam to SABIC. Unit 1 and Unit 2 have been designed to operate independently for electrical generation, while thermally integrated for steam generation, thereby optimizing efficiencies in the combined performance of the Facility.
