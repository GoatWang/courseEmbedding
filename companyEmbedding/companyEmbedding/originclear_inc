Company
OriginClear has developed a breakthrough water cleanup technology for the oil & gas, algae and other water-intensive industries.
Unlike other technologies, the company’s patent-pending Electro Water Separation™ process rapidly and efficiently removes organic material from large quantities of water without the need for chemicals.
For the oil & gas industry, OriginClear is helping clean up produced water and recycle fracking water, to reduce harm to the environment and lower costs. For the emerging algae industry, OriginClear is making large-scale harvest possible. And in aquaculture, OriginClear is helping improve yields and making seafood healthier by dramatically reducing the levels of toxic ammonia and bacteria in water. For a world short on clean water, OriginClear is the lower-cost and cleaner answer.

 Bill Charneski
President, OriginClear Group

Bill leads the OriginClear Group™, which consists of expert and profitable companies serving corporate customers in industry and agriculture. These water users are increasingly outsourcing their water treatment needs as these become more challenging, due to regulation and water shortages.

Prior to joining the company, Bill Charneski served as CEO of two startup firms, with a demonstrated track record of acquiring companies and creating sustained sales growth through the introduction of new products and process innovation.
As a chemical process engineer, plant supervisor and regional sales manager in his 15-year career at Dow Chemical, Bill gained extensive experience with process development and industrial equipment design and manufacturing, as well as a range of cross-functional knowledge and skills in marketing, sales, finance, operations, project management, team building, and quality control systems.
Bill holds an MBA degree from Central Michigan University, as well as a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois.

Clean-Frac - Model Petro - Electro Water Separation (EWS)






 
OriginClear’s proprietary Electro Water Separation (EWS) technology is particularly effective in the treatment of produced and frack flowback water from the oil & gas market. The EWS process efficiently removes non-soluble organics and inorganics, such as free & dispersed oil and suspended solids, through the two hardware stages of electro-coagulation and electro-flotation. Electro-coagulation process breaks the oil/water emulsion and...
 
 
 
 





 
 


OriginClear - Electro Water Separation (EWS)






 
OriginOil’s breakthrough water cleanup technology, called Electro Water Separation (EWS), is a high-speed, primarily chemical-free process that efficiently extracts organic contaminants from very large quantities of water.
 
 
 
 





 
 


Electro Water Separation (EWS) for Waste






 
Waste water is a growing problem as industry, agriculture and communities expand, droughts force the need for reclamation, and aquifers and reservoirs become polluted. Meanwhile, previously lightly-regulated regions of the world are enforcing much stricter environmental regulations. Better water treatment technology can solve these challenges.

OriginClear has developed a breakthrough water cleanup technology for the oil & gas, algae and other water-intensive industries.
Unlike other technologies, the company’s patent-pending Electro Water Separation™ process rapidly and efficiently removes organic material from large quantities of water without the need for chemicals.
For the oil & gas industry, OriginClear is helping clean up produced water and recycle fracking water, to reduce harm to the environment and lower costs. For the emerging algae industry, OriginClear is making large-scale harvest possible. And in aquaculture, OriginClear is helping improve yields and making seafood healthier by dramatically reducing the levels of toxic ammonia and bacteria in water. For a world short on clean water, OriginClear is the lower-cost and cleaner answer.





                        About Us
                    


What Is OriginClear?
OriginClear is a leading provider of water treatment solutions and the developer of a breakthrough water cleanup technology serving the rapidly growing $500 billion world market.
Our Acquisition Strategy
Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, OriginClear provides systems and services to treat water in a wide range of industries, such as municipal, pharmaceutical, semiconductors, industrial, and oil & gas. To rapidly grow this segment of the business, we strategically acquire profitable and well-managed water treatment companies, which allow us to expand our global market presence and technical expertise.
Our Technology
To enable a new era of clean and socially responsible water treatment solutions, we invented Electro Water Separation™, a breakthrough high-speed water cleanup technology using multi-stage electrochemistry, that we license worldwide to water treatment equipment manufacturers.
In 2015, OriginClear launched a subsidiary in Hong Kong, OriginClear (HK), and granted it a master license for the People’s Republic of China. In turn, the subsidiary is expected to license regional joint ventures for frack and waste water treatment. A research and a manufacturing center are also planned.
Our Mission
Water is our most valuable resource, and the mission of the “Family of OriginClear Companies” is to improve the quality of water and help return it to its original and clear condition.

                        More about Electro Water Separation (EWS)
                    










                        EWS Works in Two Stages
                    


1. Electro-Coagulation: contaminated water enters the first stage, which is a proprietary electro-coagulation process. In this stage, a mild electrical field is applied in specifically designed long tubes, causing the contaminants to coagulate, or “clump” together.
2. Electro-Flotation: the clumped-up material travels into a second stage where another low power electrical field generates a cloud of micro-bubbles that gently lifts the contaminants to the surface for harvesting.
Together, these stages accomplish an important third function, electro-oxidation, which is effective in removing pathogens, for example. The harvested concentrate can be made up of waste, recoverable hydrocarbons, or useful algae feedstock.





                        Licensing
                    


EWS technology is generally distributed through licensing. OriginClear offers proof-of-concept units and prototypes for licensees who want to test their markets before manufacturing. These systems also serve as a reference for their own manufacturing processes. Some specific models can be made available, under particular conditions, to non-licensees. Please consult us. All licenses are non-exclusive, but regional preferential treatment is negotiable (“Most Favored Nation”).





                        Effective in Water-Intensive Industries
                    






Because of its impressive feature set, EWS is valuable in water-intensive industries such as oil & gas, algae, and waste management.
EWS is currently deployed in various industry applications ranging from cleaning up “frack” water in oil and gas well operations, to harvesting algae for beneficial products such as fish feed.
EWS is entirely developed in-house by OriginOil and is protected by patents pending worldwide.
Continuously Fast and Extremely Thorough CleaningThis two-stage process is an energy-efficient, continuous system that advanced testing has shown can achieve up to a 99.9% removal of dispersed oil and a 99.5% removal of suspended solids. EWS technology powers water cleanup systems that are marketed by OriginClear’s licensing partners.






                        Solid-State Process Control
                    





The heart of EWS is a proprietary solid-state process control unit (PCU) that controls the entire process, and customizes the power requirements of each application.The PCU is evolving auto-adaptive features that reduce operator intervention and standardize the operating parameters.The system will feature secure communication with OriginOil cloud servers for authentication, remote operation, diagnostics, and software updates.This control system is designed to maintain maximum operating uptime for all OriginOil systems in the field, and is an asset for both end-users and service companies.

Electro Water Separation (EWS) for Waste






 
Waste water is a growing problem as industry, agriculture and communities expand, droughts force the need for reclamation, and aquifers and reservoirs become polluted. Meanwhile, previously lightly-regulated regions of the world are enforcing much stricter environmental regulations. Better water treatment technology can solve these challenges.
