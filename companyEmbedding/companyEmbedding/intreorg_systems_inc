About








Company Profile
INTREorg Systems Inc. “INTREorg” was founded in 2004 and became a fully reporting company with the Securities & Exchange Commission “SEC”, in October 2008. The company is a consulting and SAAS provider to publically traded companies. INTREorg specializes in emerging growth companies with revenues up to $500 million. The company believes that it is positioned to be the industry leader in consulting and SaaS for Shareholder Analytics.

Mission Statement
Become the recognized industry leader in shareholder analytics, shareholder compliance and related consulting services for Micro-Cap, Small-Cap, and Mid-Cap Market Growth companies.
“Redefining Partnership”
Running a successful business in today’s market is a challenging endeavor. Running a successful publically traded business can be even more challenging due to regulatory oversight, the daily mark to market, and ongoing reporting requirements. Many CEO’s of emerging growth companies simply do not have the experience or resources to handle the challenges of being public.
That is where a “partnership” with INTREorg can help. Through our consulting services and SaaS, INTREorg helps companies understand what is affecting their market capitalization and develop a strategy for improving their presence in the market while monitoring potential illegal and/or damaging transactions in the market.
INTREorg further enhances its “partnership” with the company by aligning its consulting services compensation with the success of the company.
INTREorg uses a process that has been developed through years of practice and refinement.
This process is Gather, Analyze, Inform, and Navigate.
Although this seems simple, the knowledge of what data is important, what the changes mean and what can legally be done with the information is what separates us from other companies.


GATHER
INTREorg identifies and compiles relevant data from multiple sources, then digitizes and organizes the data so that it can be analyzed. Knowing what data points are relevant is critical to INTREorg’s success.



ANALYZE
INTREorg evaluates the data using its proprietary system to apply its knowledge and expertise to understand how the data points affect each other and in turn how it affects the market capitalization of the customer.



INFORM
INTREorg provides reporting to companies in concise manageable reports designed to create an understanding of the data and how it impacts the company.



NAVIGATE
INTREorg provides actionable steps, whether it is to enhance shareholder value, position the company to raise capital, or mitigate liabilities.

Shareholder Analytics








Shareholder Analytics is the analysis of shareholder information related to the accumulation, liquidation, clearing and distribution of shares in a publically traded company.
Analyzing shareholder information is critical for companies to successfully monitor prohibited transactions, position the company for raising capital, and growing the company’s shareholder base.
INTREorg utilizes multiple sources of information that are imported into INTREorg’s proprietary system, Share Tracker Analytics or STA to analyze the information. Our STA system helps to identify trends, anomalies, and suspicious transactions.
INTREorg reports the results of the analysis to the appropriate parties within the client company. These reports are valuable to public company CEO’s, CFO’s, counsel and IR Professionals.
As part of INTREorg’s consulting services, we provide an action plan to help the company reach its short term and long term goals.

Capital Funding Strategies
Raising capital for Micro-Cap, Small-Cap and sometimes even Mid-Cap companies can be difficult. These often thinly traded stocks have proven to be fertile ground for unscrupulous investors, funding sources and even insiders which exponentially increases the risk of what are already risky investments.. Many small companies with good businesses are underfunded and in need of capital to grow their business and increase shareholder value which is why they went public in the first place. 
At INTREorg, we are able to help companies to navigate the difficult process of raising money to help them grow their businesses. INTREorg has an extensive network of investors who invest in Micro-Cap, Small-Cap and Mid-Cap companies. This network understands the power of INTREorgs Share Tracking Analytics and Consulting and its ability to identify and give companies the information they need to combat “bad” investors from destroying shareholder value. 
In addition INTREorg often takes a position in client companies as a way to align both companies’ interests in our ongoing “partnership”. 
As part of our Capital Funding Strategies, INTREorg provides companies with Stock Inventory Modeling, recommendations for timing and pricing of offerings and tools for improving investor relations.

Management









INTREorg helps a company’s executive team and board of directors establish policies and procedures to manage the complexities of shareholder services. In addition to providing companies with the tools to manage shareholder services, we can also manage shareholder services for you.
Managing a publically traded company involves an understanding of the fact that you are running two companies at one time. Public company CEO’s need to be able to understand the “other” products they have to keep an inventory of: the equity or debt instruments that trade openly in the public markets. To be an effective shareholder advocate a CEO needs to understand these key areas of the business:

What type of investors do we need?
What type of investors do we have?
How do we insure that we have the right funding partners?
Where do we find them? 
How do we secure them under the guidelines set forth under the solicitation rules that are governed by the State and Federal Securities Laws?

You need education and timely data to answer these questions in order to bring true Shareholder Value that allows you to truly balance the two companies you run on a daily basis. In order to do this you need to fully comprehend these key areas:

Shareholder Transfers
Tracking Access to Material Non-Public Information
Investor Relations
Use of Debt and Equity to Fund Growth
And much more

The management teams of publicly traded companies are often pulled in many directions from managing the day to day operations to planning the future of the company and even shareholder services. Each of these requires different talents and skill sets. Many companies fail to understand the importance or lack the skill set to manage shareholder services. Contact us to see how we can help.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

A Step-by-Step Guide to Enterprise Quality Management













Nine Steps Toward Building a Business Case for EQMS
Today’s manufacturers face enormous challenges managing their enterprise quality and compliance initiatives. Market trends point to even greater scrutiny of these efforts as pressure mounts from both consumers and regulatory agencies for manufacturers across a broad range of industries to deliver better, safer products and services. To meet these important regulatory challenges, it is imperative that manufacturers have a quality management system to manage processes and provide timely access to relevant data, effectively and efficiently.
This paper will act as a step-by-step guide to help readers:
 Get started with the system selection process
 Lay out requirements and identify the right internal stakeholders
  Set up the business case and quantify the benefits of an EQMS

“When embarking on a quality management initiative, leading companies do a good job charting out the problem statement. Obviously these initiatives can vary in scope, and best practice is for companies to take a hard look at that scope first... Companies that get very detailed, very clear and very granular as to that scope will have a clearer set of functional requirements that help in the selection of their quality management solution. It also pays dividends in terms of organizational alignment... It allows these companies to bring all their stakeholders along through the process to have clarity on the purpose,the business benefits and goals of the quality management initiative. And that is a key determinant for ultimate success.”

The Key Steps to an Effective CAPA Solution













The Case for CAPA
 
Find out how an effective CAPA system manages the entire process of evaluation and remediation of serious and possibly systematic quality events -  not to mention the expenses associated with regulatory agency-initiated enforcement, including product recalls, a stop on application for export, facility closure, and civil and criminal penalties.

From this guide learn how to:

 Create a centralized CAPA system

 Implement electronic incident tracking

 Discover, define and execute corrective action

 Use CAPA for continuous improvement

 Measure and report



A top 10 global life sciences company implemented a single global EQMS that was used by over 50 sites worldwide. All sites followed the same CAPA process, and after three years, the company had a 70% reduction in quality events, due mostly to the preventive actions assigned worldwide as a result of single events. Before, events were investigated and corrected locally, while other sites were on their own to discover and correct the same problems. Even within individual sites, there were recurring problems that were corrected, but the root cause was never identified and resolved. The formal global process saved the company millions of dollars annually. This global CAPA system also reduced the number of product recalls by over 25%. Using the industry standard 1–10-100 model, when a problem is found during production, it’s 1X the cost of manufacturing the product. If the problem is found in final testing, it’s 10X the cost of manufacturing the product. And if a product makes it into the marketplace and a problem is discovered, the cost of remediation and/or recall is usually more than 100X the cost of production. Reducing recalls by 25% and reducing quality events by 70% saved this company hundreds of millions of dollars. This organization no longer looks at quality as a cost center, but as an opportunity for real savings to their bottom line.

Guide to Optimizing Audit Management














Implement End-to-End Audit ManagementToday, best-in-class life science companies are taking a more organized approach to audit management. They’re leveraging technology that enables holistic end-to-end automation across their entire auditing process and their global organization. These solutions also integrate auditing capabilities as part of a larger quality management philosophy. This approach greatly reduces the time and cost necessary to complete audits and results in better informationGuide includes:

 How to reduce audit time and cost How to mitigate risk How to improve product quality and safety How to facilitate compliance for industry regulations"In response to recent high-profile product safety issues, the quantity and breadth of internal audits and external audits of suppliers and outsourcing partners have increased significantly. With stepped up audits, inefficient, manual, siloed processes are now causing significant problems, including: poor communications and scheduling; inefficient use of auditor and auditee resources; inconsistent audit output; lack of visibility and oversight into trends; and difficulty in ensuring appropriate follow-up on corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs). All these issues can have an adverse impact on operational effectiveness and product quality."
