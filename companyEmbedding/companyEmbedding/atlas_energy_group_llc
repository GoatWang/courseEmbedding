Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
