 Career History



Secretary

                                    Current                


NewMarket Corporation


                  Today’s NewMarket Corporation is a far cry from its beginnings in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company. As the world has evolved, so have we. And now we’re recognized worldwide as the well-balanced holding company for some of the most respected and successful companies within the petroleum additives industry.

 

Much of our success and expansion over the last century is owed to adding new industry-leading solutions and growing our base of customers. But another large part has come from strategic acquisitions.

 

Against the background of a changing global economy, this combination has helped us gain a worldwide reputation for delivering value to our customers and equity to our shareholders.

 

Today, NewMarket Corporation provides strategic guidance and insight for our family of companies. By leveraging our centralized resources, our family of companies are able to respond quickly to local market conditions and specific customer needs.


While our business has certainly evolved since we manufactured paper products over a century ago, the way we operate remains unchanged. Everyone we deal with -- employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and communities – can feel confident that NewMarket and its people act with honesty, integrity, and fairness.

Seth Rudolph had an outstanding junior season for the George Washington University men’s soccer team.
This time around could be even better.
A Belleville West product, Rudolph is drawing considerable preseason attention in the Atlantic 10 after earning first-team all-conference honors last fall. A senior forward coming off an eight-goal, 19-point season, Rudolph led the A-10 a year ago with five game-winning scores and ranked highly in several other offensive categories. He has scored 18 goals over the past two seasons.

Rudolph helped George Washington to a share of the A-10 regular-season championship in 2011. The Colonials eventually reached the title game of the A-10 postseason tournament before falling to Xavier on penalty kicks.
“I’ve had three great years (at George Washington), and I’m looking forward to this one -- everyone looks sharp,” Rudolph said. “Our goal is to make the A-10 tournament and win it.”
Rudolph may get his wish since George Washington returns 14 players from a 10-6-3 club that finished 7-2 in the conference. The Colonials open Aug. 24 against Long Island. A preseason vote of the league’s 16 coaches had George Washington sixth. Charlotte was picked to win the championship.
Rudolph’s 53 goals during a four-year preps career rank first on West’s all-time list. His 23 goals as a senior in 2008 are a single-season school record.
WASHINGTON WOMEN IN FOR ANOTHER BIG YEAR
More of the same?
That question mark could be replaced with an exclamation point when the subject is the Washington University women’s soccer team, which is No. 9 in the NCAA Division III preseason coaches poll. Two-time reigning champion Messiah (Pa.) College is No. 1.
Coming off an 18-5 year, Washington returns eight starters from a team that reached the Division III quarterfinals and established a school record for victories. Three all-Central Region selections headline Washington’s returnees in senior goalkeeper Clara Jaques (Los Angeles), junior midfielder Kate Doyle (Evanston, Ill.) and sophomore midfielder Lillie Toaspern (Denver).
Jaques, who had an 0.91 goals-against average in 2011, enters the season first in career wins (44) and second in saves (255) at Washington. Doyle anchored a defense that allowed only three goals in seven University Athletic Association games. Toaspern was the UAA rookie of the year after collecting a league-best 12 goals and 29 points.
Washington opens its season Aug. 31 when it hosts Alma (Mich.) College.
The men’s team also is gathering preseason attention. Ranked No. 21 after going 15-4-1 a year ago, the Bears reached the second round of last season's Division III postseason tournament before falling to eventual champ Ohio Wesleyan 1-0. The men, who earned a share of their first UAA title since 1999, also open Aug. 31, traveling to Birmingham (Ala.) Southern.
ONE MORE YEAR FOR SHARPE
Megan Sharpe (Edwardsville), a 5-foot-11 middle blocker for the Truman State volleyball team, will be entering her senior season at the Kirksville, Mo., school as a three-time American Volleyball Coaches Association all-American. She was a second-team selection last year.
Sharpe is the centerpiece of a program that is expected to continue what is one of the more impressive volleyball streaks among NCAA Division II schools. Truman State, 20-14 last season, has won 20 or more games for 22 consecutive years.
Sharpe earned her 2011 all-American honor after averaging 3.02 kills and 1.09 blocks per set. She had 21 double-figure kill matches as a junior and enters the year with a .343 career hitting percentage, tops on Truman State’s all-time list.
Truman was picked fifth in a vote of league coaches in the Mid-American Intercollegiate Athletics Association. Washburn (Kan.) is the favorite to win the title. This is Truman’s final academic year in the MIAA. A move to the Great Lakes Valley Conference is scheduled for the 2013-14 school year.
CENTRAL MISSOURI LOOKS TO REPEAT WITH AREA TALENT
Sophomore forward Nicki Wisnasky (Alton Marquette) and junior goalkeeper Brooke Conley (Alton) are two of the principle reasons Central Missouri is the pick to win a third straight MIAA women’s soccer title. Three more are juniors Becky Lackey (Francis Howell North), Cindy Lackey (Francis Howell North) and Kristin Bright (Summit). All five are returning starters from a 19-2 team that finished 8-0 in the MIAA.
Wisnasky is coming off a brilliant freshman season that saw her score eight goals and collect 17 points. She is the second-leading returning scorer on a team that outscored opponents 63-9. Conley had a 0.47 goals-against average and took part in 14 shutouts. She was in goal for all but 176 minutes of Central’s 2011 season.
Becky Lackey is the top returning scorer for the Jennies. The midfielder scored 11 goals as part of a 26-point sophomore season. Her sister, Cindy, and Bright, both defenders, helped anchor a defense that gave up just nine goals and posted 14 shutouts. Bright also scored six goals.
Also in the mix at Central Missouri are freshman forwards Julie Ireland (Holt) and Alexis Robbers (Orchard Farm).
HAWTHORNE THINKS FUTURE IS AT CORNERBACK
Illinois senior cornerback-receiver Terry Hawthorne (East St. Louis) is on the Paul Hornung Award watch list, an end-of-the-season honor that goes to the most versatile college football player in the nation. Hawthorne considers himself a cornerback first and feels that is where is long-range playing time will be.
“We’re short on receivers. We have a need ... (but) at the end of the day I know I’ll end up being a corner (in the NFL),” Hawthorne recently told Gatehouse News Services.
First-year Illinois coach Tim Beckman plans on using Hawthrone, a former standout wide receiver at East St. Louis, on both sides of the ball due to the Illini’s lack of depth when it comes to pass-catchers.
“I’m not a selfish player,” said Hawthorne, who had a team-best three interceptions and was third in solo tackles. “Whatever they give me, I’ll take it. Just make the most of it.”
At East St. Louis, Hawthorne twice led the Southwestern Conference in receiving yardage. His 2,513 career yards ranks behind only Keante Minor (East St. Louis), who had 2,529 and is a sophomore wideout at Arkansas.
SECOND TIME AROUND EVEN BETTER?
If her sophomore season is anything close to her freshman debut at Truman State, Abby Moser (Lafayette) will take another step toward establishing herself as one of the leading liberos on the MIAA volleyball scene.
A former Suburban West standout, Moser was an integral part of Truman’s 20-14 season -- its 22nd straight year of 20 or more wins -- and figures to leave an even stronger signature on the coming campaign. Moser earned second-team all-MIAA honors after setting a school record for single-season digs (699) and digs per set (5.34). Three times she was the MIAA specialist of the week.
At Lafayette, Moser was part of three straight Suburban West championship teams. Lafayette also won two district titles during her prep career.

OPENER DRAWING NEAR FOR LU-B FOOTBALL
Lindenwood University-Belleville football coach Jeff Fisher knows better than anyone how close the Lynx are to playing the first football game in school history. LU-Belleville opens at 1 p.m. Sept. 1 against Avila (Kan.) University.
“At this point we know we have a long way to go, we just don’t have a long time to get there,” Fisher said. “We’re focusing on fundamentals and getting each guy to know their assignment.”
Fisher was named coach six months ago. Since then, he recruited 100 players and assembled a coaching staff.
“Our first week of camp went extremely well,” he said. “We were able to get a great deal of evaluation done while teaching concepts on both sides of the ball. We have two things to focus on right now -- communication and understanding our offensive and defensive structure.”
BOLLINGER IS KEY AT ARKANSAS
Monica Bollinger (Summit) will be a key piece to the puzzle Arkansas volleyball coach Robert Pulliza is assembling at the Southeastern Conference school.
When Pulliza was hired five years ago, he brought with him a reputation as a prime recruiter and a goal of turning the Razorbacks into a national contender. Pulliza, one of a handful of coaches to have played (Ball State) and coached (Wisconsin) in the final four, continues to move Arkansas toward national prominence -- and his latest recruiting class should continue to raise the bar for the Razorbacks. That’s where Bollinger enters the equation.
A 5-foot-9 defensive specialist, Bollinger is at the heart of the freshman class and is termed by Pulliza “a defensive player that brings great skill and a competitive edge that is unmatched.” Bollinger was a four-year all-Suburban South selection at Summit, where she finished her career with a school-record 1,105 kills, 802 digs and 183 service aces.
Bollinger should provide depth to an Arkansas program that was 18-13 last season and 10-10 in the Southeastern Conference. The Razorbacks’ overall record was their best since 2005.
FITTERER READY TO GO
Kayla Fitterer (Edwardsville), a senior outside hitter at Alabama, is anxious to get her final season in the Southeastern Conference under way. Fitterer is 11 kills away from becoming the 13th player in Crimson Tide history to reach the 1,000 mark.

“It feels good to get started,” Fitterer said at the opening of preseason camp last week. “(It was) the best first session we’ve had since I’ve been here.”
Alabama was 11-20 last season, including 4-16 in the SEC West. The Tide has not qualified for the NCAA Tournament since 2007. Alabama opens the season on the road on Aug. 24-25 at the Beanpot Classic in Boston.
Fitterer ended her junior season third in the SEC with 4.01 kills per set and was fifth in the league with 13 double-doubles (kills and digs). She was a second-team all-SEC selection. At Edwardsville, Fitterer led the Tigers to conference, regional and sectional championships as a senior and owns the school record for career kills record with 1,259.
SEMO’S DAVIS EYEING REPEAT ACT
Football special teams should be fun to watch again at Southeast Missouri State, thanks to the return of Spencer Davis (Hazelwood Central) and Drew Geldbach (Eureka). Davis was one of the top all-purpose yardage players in the nation as a freshman in 2011, while Geldbach is on the fast track to more prominence in the SEMO record book for kickers.
Davis earned all-Ohio Valley Conference newcomer team honors after averaging 138.7 all-purpose yards per game, which ranked 23rd among Football Championship Series players. He returned 37 kickoffs for a 20.5 average and caught 20 passes for 315 yards, including one for 82 yards -- the third-longest reception in school history.
Davis is confident SEMO will rebound from a 2-9 record and a perform better than its last-place preseason pick in the 10-school OVC.
“I think we are going to have a good year,” he said. “The offense is really coming together.”
Placekicking is one of SEMO’s strengths with fifth-year senior Geldbach, who is the Redhawks’ top returning scorer. He kicked seven field goals and was successful on 23 extra points for a 44-point junior season. He’s among SEMO’s career leaders in field goals and extra points.
DRURY SOCCER RELYING ON ST. LOUIS TALENT
Drury is picked sixth in the Great Lakes Valley Conference men’s soccer preseason poll. If the Panthers are to achieve that spot -- or finish higher -- in the 16-school league it will likely be a result of the contributions from a strong St. Louis contingent.
Drury’s top two scorers from a 13-8 team that finished 9-6 in the GLVC are back -- junior forward Matt Hutchison (CBC) and sophomore midfielder Jack Mathis (De Smet). Hutchison registered six goals and 16 points, and Mathis collected four goals and 14 points.
Other regulars with local ties are a quartet of defenders in junior Adam Heiligenstein (Hazelwood West) and sophomores Ryan Haas (Holt), Mike Lee (CBC) and Eric Heet (Chaminade).
AROUND THE AREA
• SIU Edwardsville is picked seventh in the Ohio Valley Conference preseason women’s soccer poll. Tennessee-Martin is the choice to win the title. SIUE was 6-9-1 overall last season and 4-5 in league play.
• Bryan Belt, former associate athletics director at SIUE, has been named assistant commissioner for business affairs for the Missouri Valley Conference.
• Lindenwood-Belleville and the Gateway Grizzlies are teaming up for game-day operations during the school’s inaugural football season. The Grizzlies staff will assist LU-B with event management, overall operations and ticket sales.
• MacMurray College, which struggled through a 2-8 season a year ago, landed some key recruits from the Southwestern Conference. Linebacker Cody Buss (Belleville West), who was third on the Maroons in tackles, leads the Metro East newcomers. Others include wide receiver Cody Anderson (Belleville West), defensive lineman Stacy Harris (East St. Louis) and offensive lineman Joe Legendre (Collinsville).
• The MIAA football coaches and media both have picked Lindenwood to finish eighth in the conference race. Lindenwood is entering its first season of play in the 15-school NCAA Division II conference following a transition period from the NAIA. Defending national champ Pittsburg (Kan.) State was selected to win the MIAA title, followed by perennial national contender Northwest State. Lindenwood was 8-3 a year ago as a Division II independent.
• Junior guards Keith Pickens (Oakville) and Nathan Scheer (Borgia) are part of the Missouri State men’s basketball team making a seven-day tour of Costa Rica this week. Pickens averaged 4.8 points and 4.4 rebounds last year after missing the 2010-11 season with a knee injury. Scheer averaged 2.5 points as a sophomore for Missouri State, which is coming off a 16-16 finish. Also a part of the tour is the Missouri State women’s team and junior guard Hannah Wilkerson (Miller Career), who averaged 2.9 points for a 24-9 team.
• Defending champion Southeast Missouri was picked second in the Ohio Valley Conference women’s soccer preseason poll. SEMO returns 10 players, including all-OVC junior goalkeeper Ashton Aubuchon (Hazelwood West), from a 12-6-1 squad that went 8-1 in the conference. Aubuchon led the conference with an 0.78 GAA and eight shutouts. SEMO allowed the fewest goals (16) in the conference.
• A pair of local freshmen are on Bellarmine (Ky.) University’s field hockey team, one of the top Division II programs in the nation. Forward Hayley Boken (Nerinx Hall) and goalkeeper Alex Moro (Visitation) are working for playing time with the Knights, who were 13-4 last year.
