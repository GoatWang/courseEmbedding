     http://www.innovuspharma.com  https://twitter.com/innovuspharma  http://shop.innovuspharma.com/ * shareholders, please consider purchasing product(s)   ***ALERT***  Awaiting Official Announcement of FDA Approval for FlutiCare      FlutiCare™ Approval could bring a BILLION DOLLARS in sales annually REDONDO BEACH, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 12, 2016) - SECFilings.com, a leading financial news and information portal offering free real time public company filing alerts, discusses the potential impact of the anticipated FDA ruling on Innovus Pharmaceuticals' (OTCQB: INNV) ANDA filing for FlutiCare™, the company's over-the-counter treatment for allergic rhinitis. FlutiCare™ is designed to treat non-allergic rhinitis -- better known as "hay fever" or "stuffy nose" -- which affects roughly 50 million Americans each year. While 70% of these individuals use over-the-counter products, more than half are not satisfied with the treatment option, according to an Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America survey, which suggests there's an opportunity for a prescription-strength OTC treatment option to capture market share from category leaders. As the #1 prescription nasal steroid with over 177 million units sold since 2007, Innovus believes that the over-the-counter version of FlutiCare™ could be worth up to $1 billion per year by addressing a much wider over-the-counter market. The FDA decision is expected in the next several weeks.         The CEO has already signed an agreement for the manufacturing of FlutiCare    Innovus Pharma Achieves Major Milestone With Securing a Manufacturing Agreement for FlutiCare in Anticipation of the FDA Decision   SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - May 31, 2016) - Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

		"Innovus Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported 3Q16 results, which showed an improvement in revenues and gross margins on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Revenues rose by 947% over 3Q15 and more than 80% sequentially to $1.9mn, as compared to $0.2mn in 3Q15 and $1.0mn in 2Q16, respectively. . .we see several potential catalysts for the company over the next year stemming from new products, such as Fluticare and Urox, as well as the company potentially reaching recurring adjusted profitability in 2017E. Additionally, management continues
to discuss uplisting shares to a national exchange, which could also serve as a catalyst given the potential for increased liquidity and access to more institutional investors."

		"Innovus Pharmaceuticals Inc. recently completed the acquisition of Beyond Human, which has expanded its pipeline to include 13 commercialized products and three pipeline products, and has several upcoming key milestones on the horizon, including Fluticare. Innovus management expects to hear from the FDA regarding its ANDA for Fluticare, which is perhaps the crown jewel of the company's pipeline, targeting what Innovus estimates is a $1B potential opportunity. . .Innovus appears to be making progress in the early stages of commercialization, given that Innovus has stated that it has signed eight commercial partnerships with over $500M in sales milestones plus royalties, in 60 countries."

		"Innovus Pharmaceuticals Inc. completed what appears to be a well-conceived and potentially transformative strategic move on March 1, 2016 with the acquisition of revenue generating assets of Beyond Human. The move will add scale and accelerate the companys push towards achieving profitability  potentially as soon as 2017. . .with the acquisition of assets of Beyond Human, Innovus now has
13 commercial products and 3 pipeline products targeting a $3
billion market opportunity in mens and womens health and vitality
and respiratory disease."

(the “Company” or “Innovus Pharma”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV) today announced that the Company filed its Product License Application with Health Canada as a Natural Health Product (“NPN”) to market its current best-selling product Vesele® with the indication to “Help Improve Symptoms of Sexual Dysfunction.” If accepted by Health Canada, Vesele® will be available over-the-counter (“OTC”) in 120 capsule bottles and will not require a prescription. The product if approved will not be reimbursed by the Canadian government, therefore, the Company will be able to set the retail price as it does in the United States. If approved, the Company expects to directly launch the product itself through its Beyond Human® sales and marketing platform currently being set up in Canada and through other sales channels.Based on Health Canada’s approval process, the approval process normally takes up to six (6) months in Canada for this type of product, assuming no additional information is requested by Health Canada.“If approved by Health Canada for commercialization in Canada, Vesele® will be our fourth product on the Canadian market including Zestra®, Zestra Glide® and EjectDelay® sold under the name Uxor™ by our partner Orimed Pharma,” said Dr. Bassam Damaj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharma. “Having Vesele® be an NPN in Canada, bearing the indication of 'Help Improve Symptoms of Sexual Dysfunction,' would be a great value add to the product and a great accomplishment for the Company,” continued Dr. Damaj.Vesele® is a proprietary oral formulation of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline with the natural absorption enhancer Bioperine®. Vesele® was formulated to increase blood flow and nitric oxide production.As previously reported, a U.S. human clinical use survey was completed on Vesele® to evaluate erectile dysfunction and sexual satisfaction in men using Vesele® twice daily for up to four months with the following favorable results:1. 49.5% increase in erection hardness2. 44.5% increase in erection maintenance3. 34.6% increase in desire for sexual activity4. 34.1% increase the ability to satisfy the partnerAbout Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Headquartered in San Diego, Innovus Pharma is an emerging over-the-counter (“OTC”) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women’s health and vitality and respiratory diseases.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
