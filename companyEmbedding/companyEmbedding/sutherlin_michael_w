Michael Sutherlin to retire as Joy Global president, CEO

Michael W. Sutherlin, president and chief executive officer of Joy Global Inc., announced plans Thursday to retire at the end of this year.
The board of directors has designated Edward "Ted" Doheny II, 50, president and chief operating officer of the company's underground mining equipment division, as Sutherlin's successor.
Sutherlin, 66, has been with Joy Global since 2003 and has been CEO since December 2006. Previously, he was president and chief operating officer of Varco International Inc., then a $2 billion manufacturer of equipment for the oil and gas drilling industry.
Sutherlin said he expects a smooth transition when Doheny takes charge of the company.
"This is not really going to be any dramatic change to the business. I think you will see a lot of continuity in the programs we have and the direction we have been going in," Sutherlin said.
The transition creates a new position of corporate chief operating officer to be filled by Randal W. Baker, now president and chief operating officer of the surface mining equipment division.
Baker also has been a Joy Global executive vice president. He joined the company in 2009, and before that he had 23 years of experience in the construction, mining and agricultural equipment industries.
From 2004 to 2009, Baker was president and CEO of Case IH Agriculture Inc. He has a bachelor's degree in mining engineering from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.
Doheny has been executive vice president of Joy Global and president and chief operating officer of the underground mining equipment division since 2006. Before that, he spent 20 years with Ingersoll Rand Corp. in senior executive positions, including president of industrial technologies from 2003 to 2005. He has a bachelor's degree in engineering from Cornell University and a master's degree in management from Purdue University.
Sutherlin said that he, Doheny and Baker have worked closely together to develop the company's strategies in recent years.
"There are a huge number of people who live and die for this business. It's like a family. Everybody looks out for each other. We fight and argue on issues, and then we support and back each other up," he added.
Sutherlin expects to formally retire on Feb. 1. However, the transition in responsibilities to Doheny will be completed by December immediately following publication of Joy Global's 2013 financial results.
Sutherlin said he's accomplished what he set out to achieve in his career.
Since he became CEO in late 2006, Joy's sales have doubled amid strong global demand for mined commodities such as copper and coal. The company completed five acquisitions worth a combined $2.4 billion, including LeTourneau Technologies Inc. in the United States and International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. in China.
Sutherlin put Joy Global in a "stronger position" by focusing on product development and business discipline, and by taking advantage of global opportunities, said analyst Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Research.
"I sort of feel like I am at the point where it's as good as I can do," Sutherlin said. "I will turn in my assignment, and I think I will get a good grade."
There have been recent challenges. Demand for mining equipment in some of Joy Global's key markets fell in 2012 as utility companies used less coal to generate electricity and switched to cheaper natural gas.
"Mining has been under quite a bit of pressure, given a lot of the original-equipment customers have been going back and reassessing mine expansions and new mines," said analyst Mircea Dobrea with Robert W. Baird & Co.
China's slowing economy created coal surpluses and drove commodity prices lower.
"The near-term trends are challenging. But one of the things that makes Joy Global attractive to investors is the high proportion of aftermarket business that's very much recurring," Dobrea said.
The company has spent millions of dollars upgrading its Milwaukee factory, although it has pursued plans to reduce manufacturing costs that could affect the operations here.
There's been widespread speculation that Joy Global was a takeover target.
With Sutherlin retiring, however, a takeover of the company is "probably not in the cards in the shorter term," said analyst Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets.
"Nobody would leave if they thought their company was about to get taken over," Tiss said.
When he retires, Sutherlin plans to spend more time with his family, play more golf and work on some "long neglected hobbies," including restoring old autos.
He will probably be active on the board of directors for a couple of companies, but that will be about the extent of his executive endeavors.
"I have had a long working career, and I am not looking for things to keep me busy for 60 hours a week," Sutherlin said.
Bloomberg News contributed to this report.
