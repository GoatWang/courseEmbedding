Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com UK's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.

Taiwan shares end higher after slow start
2017/07/03 16:29:30




Taipei, July 3 (CNA) Shares in Taiwan lost ground early but rebounded to finish in positive territory on Monday despite fears of further volatility among high-tech stocks on Wall Street, dealers said.The bellwether electronics sector remained sluggish, but contract chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電), the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, edged higher and old economy and financial stocks also lent support to the broader market, they said.The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange ended up 17.72 points, or 0.17 percent, at the day's high of 10,412.79, off an early low of 10,363.50, on turnover of NT$83.19 billion (US$2.74 billion).The market opened down 0.53 percent and fell to the day's low as investors reacted to losses suffered by U.S. semiconductor stocks, which pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down 0.53 percent on Friday, dealers said.With the Taiex approaching a recent intraday low of 10,341 hit on June 26, however, some bargain hunters turned active to pick up large cap stocks such as TSMC along with old economy and financial shares to prevent the market from falling further, dealers added."The local equity market remained awash in liquidity, which was the major factor supporting the weighted index today," Hua Nan Securities analyst Kevin Su said."Judging from today's movement, I think the market has strong technical support at around 10,341 points."TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, rose 0.24 percent to close at NT$209.00, with 19.03 million shares changing hands."I think foreign institutional investors were net buyers of the stock to boost the Taiex on the spot market and profit in the futures market, where they still have many long position contracts," Su said.As of Friday, foreign institutional investors owned 47,900 more long position contracts (which expect prices to rise) than short position contracts in the local futures market, Su said.Other integrated circuit stocks felt the pinch of the fall in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.United Microelectronics Corp. (聯電), a smaller rival of TSMC, fell 2.37 percent to close at NT$14.40, and IC packaging and testing service provider Siliconware Precision Industries Co. (矽品) lost 0.41 percent to end at NT$48.95.But IC designer MediaTek Inc. (聯發科) gained 2.69 percent to close at NT$267.50 after a foreign brokerage raised its target price for the stock."Buying largely rotated to non-high-tech stocks today on the back of bargain hunting. That's also why the broader market managed to end above the previous closing level," Su said.The shipping sector, which expects a strong second half of 2017, posted strong gains. Evergreen Marine Corp. (長榮海運) gained 4.85 percent to close at NT$16.20 and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. (陽明海運) rose 4.78 percent to end at NT$13.15.Among the gaining financial stocks, Cathay Financial Holding Co. (國泰金) added 1.04 percent to close at NT$48.60, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. (富邦金) rose 0.86 percent to end at NT$46.85 after going ex-dividend as investors hoped to push them up to their ex-dividend levels."Worries over further volatility among high-tech stocks in the U.S. market remain because of their high valuations, so there is only limited room for local equities to go higher in the short term," Su said."Such concerns were reflected in a fall in today's turnover, which was below the NT$90 billion level."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
