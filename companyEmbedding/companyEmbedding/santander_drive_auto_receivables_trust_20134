Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5
    





November 21, 2013 02:06 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 notes:
    

      --$223,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$226,580,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$201,920,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$204,470,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,960,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87,380,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Marginally Weaker Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-5 is 
      representative of subprime borrowers. While the weighted average (WA) 
      Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score (590) and internal loss forecasting score 
      (LFS; 563) are relatively consistent with the prior three transactions, 
      the 2013-5 pool has a higher concentration in the weaker LFS score 
      buckets.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE totals 45.80% for the class A 
      up from 43% in 2013-4 (not rated by Fitch) and 2013-3, and is higher for 
      the class B, C and D notes, but unchanged for the class E notes. The 
      higher CE in 2013-5 compensates for the marginally weaker pool, lower 
      excess spread, and the incorporation of the unhedged floating-rate class 
      A-2B notes.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      SCUSA's portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations declined from prior 
      years, supported by the improving U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values elevating recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Negative Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2013-5 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. For both scenarios, the 
      senior tranche notes do not display negative rating sensitivities.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Fitch Upgrades 4 and Affirms 8 Classes of Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Upgrades 4 and Affirms 8 Classes of Santander Drive Auto 
      Receivables Trust
    





April 15, 2015 01:04 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has taken the 
      following rating actions on the Santander (SDART) 2013-3 and 2014-2 
      transactions:
    

      2013-3
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class D upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class E upgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      2014-2
    

      --Class A-2-A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2-B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B placed on Rating Watch Positive at 'AAsf';
    

      --Class C affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class D affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class E affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement and loss 
      performance. The collateral pools continue to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Under the credit enhancement structures, the securities 
      are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current 
      rating and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms 
      of the documents.
    

      Fitch's review is based on the initial base case cumulative net loss 
      (CNL) estimate of 16.45% for the 2014-2 transaction. For the 2013-3, 
      transaction, Fitch revised its loss proxy from 16.15% to 15.35%, as 
      losses are currently extrapolating below Fitch's prior base case loss 
      proxy assigned at the last review of the transaction. Based on current 
      loss trends, Fitch projects CNL for both transactions to be in the 
      13-16% range.
    

      The upgrades in the 2013-3 transaction reflect the improved loss 
      coverage available to the notes. Placing class B in the 2014-2 
      transaction on Rating Watch Positive reflects Fitch's expectation that 
      this note will likely be eligible for a single-category upgrade given 
      additional amortization over the next six months. Further, Fitch will 
      continue to monitor both transactions and may take additional rating 
      actions within this timeframe.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Santander Consumer USA, Inc.'s retail 
      auto loan originations, the adequacy of its servicing capabilities, and 
      the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      both transactions. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In the 2013-3 transaction, classes A, B and C demonstrated limited 
      sensitivity to various loss-timing scenarios while classes D and E show 
      muted growth in their respective rating loss multiples under a 
      back-ended loss timing scenario. In the 2014-2 transaction, the class A 
      and B notes demonstrated limited sensitivity to various loss-timing 
      scenarios while classes C, D and E exhibit declines in loss coverage 
      multiples under a back-ended loss timing scenario.
    

      To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with losses 
      within Fitch's initial expectations, with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels consistent with the current ratings. A material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analyses of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of these 
      transactions can be found in the respective appendices listed below. 
      These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      March 26, 2015.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.
