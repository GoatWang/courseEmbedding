A word or two about the South State Way.





HomeAbout 







A Message from Our CEO

South State Bank has been serving the financial needs of individuals and businesses in the South since 1934. By staying true to our values of relationship banking and commitment to our customers, we’re proud to be one of the fastest growing banks in the Southeast. 
Great banking starts with great bankers. And, thanks to our dedicated team of bankers, we have faithfully executed our mission to build a high-performing bank based on a balance of soundness, profitability and growth. And as we continue to build on this success, I want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve as your financial partner now and in the future.







Our Values
Simply put, we value our customers. Everything we do is backed by a philosophy of service and a commitment to supporting the communities we call home. We realize we’re not just managing people’s money — we’re fueling their dreams and guiding their way.


Integrity
Our principles represent the soul of our company and the people who work here, as well as those who founded this bank. We stay true to those principles.


Trust
It's earned on a daily basis. By offering genuine hospitality and expert financial stewardship, we show customers how much we value their business. 


Relationship
What's built over time is shaped by every interaction with our customers. And it always starts with a conversation.


Service
It's not about a customer's background, circumstances or the size of his or her account. We serve people, first and foremost.






Our History
A bank built on service since 1934.

About
A word or two about the South State Way.





HomeAbout 







A Message from Our CEO

South State Bank has been serving the financial needs of individuals and businesses in the South since 1934. By staying true to our values of relationship banking and commitment to our customers, we’re proud to be one of the fastest growing banks in the Southeast. 
Great banking starts with great bankers. And, thanks to our dedicated team of bankers, we have faithfully executed our mission to build a high-performing bank based on a balance of soundness, profitability and growth. And as we continue to build on this success, I want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve as your financial partner now and in the future.







Our Values
Simply put, we value our customers. Everything we do is backed by a philosophy of service and a commitment to supporting the communities we call home. We realize we’re not just managing people’s money — we’re fueling their dreams and guiding their way.


Integrity
Our principles represent the soul of our company and the people who work here, as well as those who founded this bank. We stay true to those principles.


Trust
It's earned on a daily basis. By offering genuine hospitality and expert financial stewardship, we show customers how much we value their business. 


Relationship
What's built over time is shaped by every interaction with our customers. And it always starts with a conversation.


Service
It's not about a customer's background, circumstances or the size of his or her account. We serve people, first and foremost.






Our History
A bank built on service since 1934.
