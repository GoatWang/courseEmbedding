                           worldwide
                           In organisation theory a schism has developed between the traditional organisational behaviour literature, based in psychology,
                              sociology and political science, and the more analytically rigorous field of organisational economics. The former stresses
                              the importance of managerial leadership and cooperation among employees, while the latter focuses on the engineering of incentive
                              systems that will induce efficiency and profitability, by rewarding worker self-interest. In this innovative book, Gary Miller
                              bridges the gap between these literatures. He demonstrates that it is impossible to design an incentive system based on self-interest
                              that will effectively discipline all subordinates and superiors and obviate or overcome the roles of political conflict, collective
                              action, and leadership in an organisation. Applying game theory to the analysis of the roles of cooperation and political
                              leadership in organisational hierarchies, he concludes that the organisation whose managers can inspire cooperation and the
                              transcendence of short-term interest in its employees enjoys a competitive advantage

                           "Economic development requires secure contract enforcement and stable property rights. Normal majority-rule politics, such
                              as bargaining over distributive and monetary policies, generate instability and frequently undermine economic development.
                              Above Politics argues that bureaucracies can contribute to stability and economic development, but only if they are insulated
                              from unstable politics. A separation-of-powers stalemate creates the conditions for bureaucratic autonomy. But what keeps
                              delegated bureaucrats from being more abusive as they become more autonomous? One answer is the negotiation of long-term,
                              cooperative relationships - that (when successful) typically bind subordinates to provide more effort in exchange for autonomy.
                              Even more compelling is professionalism, which embeds its professional practitioners in professional norms and culture, and
                              incidentally mitigates corruption. Financial examples are provided throughout the book, which ends with an analysis of the
                              role played by professionalized bureaucracies during the Great Recession"

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Miller Gary J Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Miller Gary J Jr currently holds license 2101144165 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Miller Gary J Jr



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Does the fitting include a thorough eye examination and follow-up? Can you exchange lenses during the initial fitting, and is insurance for lost lenses available? If you need treatment for an eye condition not directly related to the contact lenses, such as inflamed eyelids or dry eyes, there may be additional charges. If you are interested in a contact lens fit with our office, please call the closest location and speak with a patient representative.Cataract SurgeryThe most common type of adult onset ptosis is due to a weakening of the attachment between the levator muscle (the muscle that raises the upper lid) and the eyelid. This may occur as a result of the aging process, after cataract surgery or contact lens wear, or from an injury.GlaucomaTreatment for glaucoma focuses on preserving eyesight by slowing the damage to the optic nerve. Most treatment aims to prevent further damage to the optic nerve by lowering the pressure in the eyes. As a rule, damage caused by glaucoma cannot be reversed. Eye drops, pills, laser and surgical operations are used to prevent or retard further damage from occurring. At Regional Eye Associates we take pride in offering a variety of treatment options dependant on your needs.OphthalmologyBoard-certified ophthalmologists, optometrists and certified technical staff utilize the most modern and sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic equipment available. In addition to regular examinations, more extensive evaluations and consultations are available with photographic, angiography and ultrasonography testing. Ophthalmology also utilizes advanced laser and microscopic instruments and surgery.Macular DegenerationDr. Miller joined Regional Eye Associates in 2011 and specializes in diabetic eye disease, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, macular holes, and many other vitreoretinal diseases. His combined expertise in technology and vitreoretinal diseases allows him to fully customize treatments for his patients. When he is not providing excellent patient care, Dr. Miller enjoys spending time with his family and cheering on his beloved Mountaineers. He and his wife Erin have two sons, Evan and Luke. Dr. Miller also enjoys many outdoor activities like biking, running, and gardening in his spare time. Dr. Miller and his family reside in Morgantown.Laser Eye SurgeryLASIK, or laser in-situ keratomileusis, is the fastest-growing and most accepted form of laser vision correction. LASIK can treat both nearsightedness and farsightedness with or without astigmatism.CataractsThe TRULIGN is an intraocular lens implant used to replace the natural lens of the eye following the removal of a cataract. Regional Eye Associates are proud to offer our patients the latest advancements in intraocular lens technology and are pleased to offer TRULIGN at our offices serving the Morgantown, Fairmont, Bridgeport, Waynesburg and Petersburg regions.Plastic SurgeonsBotoxThe doctors at Regional Eye Associates have been administering BOTOX® injections for the medical treatment of blepharospasm (eyelid spasm) for over a decade. We are happy to announce that BOTOX® Cosmetic is now available and personally administered by these same experienced physicians to accurately and effectively treat fine facial lines and wrinkles for both men and women. BOTOX® has proven to be the best non-surgical form of facial rejuvenation and is capable of producing improvements in your appearance.Eyelid SurgeryTo perform upper eyelid surgery, an incision is made in the upper eyelid crease to remove excess eyelid skin. The original incision is then closed with fine, dissolvable stitches. Because the incisions are made in the eyelids' natural contours, they are barely visible. These cut-marks will eventually dissolve or fade over time. There is a mild amount of bruising following this type of surgery, but does not last long and is usually gone within 1-2 weeks.BlepharoplastyPtosis is a condition in which the upper eyelid(s) droops. The eyelid may droop only slightly or it may droop enough to partially or completely cover the pupil, restricting or obscuring the field of vision. Ptosis should not be confused with extra skin, fat, or muscle to the eyelid, which are typically addressed with blepharoplasty surgery. When ptosis can be shown to reduce vision (peripheral vision), its correction is covered by most insurance plans. This can be determined at your consultation by the results of a visual field test. If the degree of ptosis is not as severe (does not affect vision), it is considered elective surgery and can be corrected as a cosmetic procedure, which is not covered by insurance.Cosmetic SurgeryGynecologistsGynecologyDr. Amanda Sherman, practices Obstetrics and Gynecology. He also has three adult children, Janelle Vance, Lauren Mayle and Alex Mayle.ObstetricsEndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyHaving regular eye exams is key to a healthy eye care plan for people who have diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in American adults.InternistsInternal MedicineDr. Lemley attended West Virginia University for his undergraduate education. In 1990, he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry. He also is a graduate of West Virginia University School of Medicine. During medical school, Dr. Lemley was a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha medical honor society. After medical school, he performed an internship in internal medicine at the Ruby Memorial Hospital. He completed his residency in ophthalmology at West Virginia Eye Institute and served as chief resident from 1997-1998. Dr. Lemley completed a fellowship in Cornea, External Disease and Refractive Surgery at the University of Oklahoma, Dean McGee Eye Institute, in 1999. He served as the Director of Cornea and Refractive Surgery at Great Lakes Eye Care until joining Regional Eye Associates in August 2001. He is a board certified ophthalmologist. Currently Dr. Lemley is a member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS), American Medical Association (AMA), Christian Ophthalmology Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and WV Academy of Ophthalmology.Send to PhoneMiller, Gary J, MD888 Memorial Dr, Oakland, MD 21550(301) 334-1146Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailMiller, Gary J, MD888 Memorial Dr, Oakland, MD 21550(301) 334-1146Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
