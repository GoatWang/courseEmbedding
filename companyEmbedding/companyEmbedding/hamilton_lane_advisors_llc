Many of the employees are friends outside of workConsTons of inefficiencies and terrible people that get kept on due to tenure/inability for management to get rid of them. Lots of favoritism amongst management; if you do not belong to a country club and/or did not go to private school on the Main Line, it will be tough for you to connect. Some of the Executives are extreme snobs who view talking with junior team members are beneath them, declining to acknowledge their existence in meetings and hallways. A lot of lip service is paid to the culture but majority of the people above VP are pretty unfriendly.Advice to ManagementOffer training to junior employees, staff appropriately rather than overloading everyone with too many menial responsibilities.

Can't say it changed much though.- Compensation is below industry standard and only varies slightly among individual/team. Not worth working an extra 20+ hrs/week on Team A and getting a marginally higher bonus compared to Team B. Work-life balance is similarly variable.- Certain managers are not good at managing.- Limited internal opportunities; external opportunities further limited. Instances of management actively blocking moves.- Every single departure is called "planned turnover" ... I have never been at another company where employees left *without* having another position lined up, which has been the case here.Advice to ManagementTo the C-Suite: do not let your VPs/Principals/MDs grind your Sr. Associates through Analysts into the ground.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (15) Hamilton Lane Advisors Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hamilton Lane Advisors 2015-10-27 16:39 PDT Feb 18, 2015 Helpful (10)"Senior Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Hamilton Lane Advisors full-time (More than 3 years)ProsEveryone is young and hard workingThere is a good work-life balanceSeveral events throughout the year to get to know your co-workersMonday lunches are provided each weekConsIn certain departments, there is limited upward mobilityCompensation does not always reflect efforts and can be politically influencedShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (10) Hamilton Lane Advisors Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hamilton Lane Advisors 2015-02-18 11:41 PST Jan 25, 2015 Helpful (28)"Middle Management Heavy, Overly Focused On Process and Minutae"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Hamilton Lane Advisors full-time (More than 3 years)Pros- Free Monday lunch- People are friendly- Majority of the company doesn't have to work too late (sorry FIT, not you)- New office is really nice (old office....not so much)- Good exposure (thru update meetings, etc) to some of the major players in PECons- Most Middle Management Heavy place i have ever worked at     I feel like every department has surplus VPs, people who have been at the company for 5-10+ years, make really good money (this is where the major pay bump comes into play) - and yet really don't do anything. A lot of VPs rely HEAVILY on their senior associates/associates/analysts to perform the bulk of the work. And given the fact the VPs easily make 2-3x what their juniors make and most analysts and associates will never make VP....well, you do the math.- Unequal treatment across departments    Product and BD people seem to have it pretty well ( the VPs and above). FIT gets worked to the bone, and many stay until 7-9pm regularly writing memos. Other investment teams (CI, Secondary, and research) seem to burn thru their analysts and associates pretty quickly. Client Services is totally unorganized and relies heavily on temp labor.- Out of Touch Executives   Friendly and well spoken people, but poor managers. Becoming obvious that they have their "inner-circle" and probably don't know the names of anyone hired in the last 2 years. Generally out of touch, have their inner circle of VP and senior folk that they focus on developing. Problem is, the VPs don't care to "develop" their associates/analysts.- Feedback/Review Process    Genuinely the most frustrating feedback mechanism i have ever experienced. If you are not drinking the HL Kool Aid, you won't be moving up any time soon. Most VP+ people are focusing on climbing the ladder and not developing their junior talent. For that reason, the turnover across the junior ranks is spiking.- All the "Culture" Talk   Some of the other reviews mentioned the guitars, the excessive talk of culture, etc etc. This is spot on - I have never seen a place devote so much lip-service to its "amazing culture" and its "unique environment." Fact: It's a typical cube-farm with guitars on the wall and meeting rooms named after rock stars, in the middle of a bland office park, 30 mins outside of Philly, and NO ONE hangs out after work. Maybe the first-year analysts, but that's it (because they all live in the city anyway). And despite said "amazing culture" no one will admit there is a legit turnover issue amongst analysts/associates.Advice to ManagementThe company has grown significantly and you are not keeping up. FIT is mired in redundant processes and bureaucracy that is demoralizing people. Weed out some of the surplus/incompetent VPs - it's getting ridiculous. Allow real room for advancement for analysts/associates and stop telling me how lucky i am because i get pizza on Monday and have guitars on the meeting room walls.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (28) Hamilton Lane Advisors Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hamilton Lane Advisors 2015-01-25 15:00 PST Jan 17, 2015 Helpful (11)"Awkwardly Structured, Poor Leadership, Sub-par Stay"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Analyst in Philadelphia, PACurrent Employee - Analyst in Philadelphia, PADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Hamilton Lane Advisors full-time (More than a year)ProsMost of the people who work there are relatively nice. Employees receive free lunch every Monday. Also, most holidays are off. The new office boasts nice architecture and sleek office furniture as well. Exposure to various clients within the industry can be rewarding. Finally, most of the people who work there are fairly young.Cons1) This company seriously lacks diversity of any type. There are very few women and even less people of color. Most of the individuals working here lacked better options, so they settled for a grossly underpaid "finance" gig. As a result, most conversations lack substance and exhibit acute knowledge of private equity or finance.2) Compensation was dreadfully low. One could liken the pay to working at a retail store in the mall or working at a fast food restaurant. Many people will gloat about the free lunches on Monday; however, most of Hamilton Lane's industry peers offer free food every just about every day.3) The company is poorly structured and flooded with inefficiencies and redundant practices. In some cases, you may not receive effective training on projects you are expected to complete. Additionally, getting effective feedback is tough--especially when you don't fit the Hamilton Lane prototype.4) The company's leadership can be extremely petty. That leads one to wonder how a company that does so little for its employees could earn a spot as one of the best places to work in Philadelphia. Also, how does one win such an accolade being outside of the confines of Philadelphia? There are also very few opportunities to move up and advance in the company. Again, how can one be content as a 40-something year old associate.My final words are proceed with caution. There will always be a better option than staying at this dead-end company.Advice to ManagementMy advice to management would be to build actual management skills and plan strategically. You will continue to thwart talented people from joining your firm if continue to run in a manner without coherent structure. Also decide whether or not you want entry-level positions to be outsourced overseas or fulfilled by college graduates in the United States. You give off an impression that the firm is in financial trouble.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (11) Hamilton Lane Advisors Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Hamilton Lane Advisors 2015-01-17 10:11 PST Oct 23, 2014 Helpful (7)"Good Firm With Some Growing Pains"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Analyst in Bala Cynwyd, PAFormer Employee - Analyst in Bala Cynwyd, PADoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Hamilton Lane Advisors full-time (More than 3 years)ProsGood industry and client focusNice place to learn about PENice work-home scheduleNice people to work with.Gym on siteFree lunches on MondayConsThe firm is trying to get by on its reputation as a nice place to work which is based on when it was a much smaller firm. Quite frankly, that is getting stale. The firm has growing pains, caused by weak middle managers and supervisors. Neither upper management nor HR will change anything, so it is either follow along or get out. The culture’s nice but you can get the same culture elsewhere without the backstabbing and melodrama. A “Have” vs. “Have Not” clique mentality is growing. HR also spends a great deal of time getting on those “Best Places to Work” list. If you have to ask your employees to vote for the best place to work you probably aren’t one of those places.The firm is famous for its conference rooms named for guitars or guitar legends. Whoopee. It is work; do you real need to have your coolness bona fide? If so, buy yourself a pair of righteous shades and wear your baseball cap backwards.You will learn a lot at Hamilton Lane, but one of the problems is getting pigeon-holed where you do not want to be or getting caught up in growing jealousy between departments. On the fund investment team, you will work long hours, which is standard in this type of job, but is not standard for other departments at the firm. Client service and BD are where you want to be to get really noticed. The IT team plods along, probably because the staff of developers is constantly in flux while the Director of IT is reading everyone’s emails and watching the surveillance cameras. Other than that, everything is fine.Advice to ManagementStart with a 360 review.
