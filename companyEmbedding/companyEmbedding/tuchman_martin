Published on Mar 7, 2016Martin Tuchman, a philanthropist and entrepreneur, earned his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from NJIT in 1962. Soon after, Tuchman started his career at Railway Express Agency as an automotive engineer. In 1968, Tuchman co-founded Interpool, one of the nation’s leading container leasing corporations. In 1987, just a year before NJIT’s School of Management was founded, Tuchman formed Trac Lease and developed it into the largest chassis leasing company in the United States.Today, Tuchman is the chief executive officer of Kingstone Capital V, an investment firm with holdings in real estate, banking and international shipping. He also serves as chairman of The Tuchman Foundation, an umbrella company for the Tuchman Foundation and Parkinson’s Alliance, which works closely with Parkinson’s research organizations that seek grants and approval from the National Institutes of Health.Tuchman is a distinguished alumnus who has served and supported NJIT throughout the years. He was the recipient of the Alumni of the Year Award (1996), served as a member of the NJIT Board of Trustees (1996-2002) and is currently a member of the NJIT Board of Overseers. A loyal Highlander, he made his first donation just a few years after graduation and has since generously given to scholarships and to support other causes. He shares his passion for business and technology with the faculty and students of the School of Management.NJIT’s School of Management (SOM) was named on March 3, 2016 in honor of distinguished alumnus Martin Tuchman. This is the first time in the school’s 27-year history that it will carry a formal name: Martin Tuchman School of Management.

NEWARK, N.J., Jan. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- NJIT's School of Management (SOM), which shapes students to become technology leaders, managers and powerbrokers, will be named March 3, 2016 in honor of distinguished alumnus Martin Tuchman. This is the first time in the school's 27-year history that it will carry a formal name: The Martin Tuchman School of Management. 
Tuchman, a philanthropist and entrepreneur, earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering from NJIT in 1962. Soon after, Tuchman started his career at Railway Express Agency as an automotive engineer. In this position he and a team of shipping engineers developed the current standard for intermodal containers and chassis. The purpose of the innovation was to allow for total interchangeability of equipment in every mode: rail, truck and ship, as well as structural integrity. The standard is still in use.
"Marty Tuchman has always been an innovator in technology and business, and an alumnus who is generous with his time on the behalf of his alma mater. He has been a longtime adviser and friend to me personally and to the university," said NJIT President Joel S. Bloom. "He's an exemplar for our students who need to understand the interstices of technology, business and life in order to succeed. We're honored and delighted to have the School of Management named after Marty Tuchman."
In 1968, Tuchman and his colleague Warren Serenbetz founded Interpool, one of the nation's leading container leasing corporations. In 1987, just a year before SOM was founded, Tuchman formed Trac Lease and developed it into the largest chassis leasing company in the United States. In July 2007, Tuchman sold Interpool to a private equity firm for approximately $2.4 billion.
"I believe so strongly in NJIT's programs and vision that I provide support through time and resources for its endeavors. The leadership and faculty are devoted to propelling NJIT to the next level by focusing on the hands-on principles that engineers and others will use throughout their careers," said Tuchman. "I'm particularly excited about the new direction of the School of Management and its attention to the critical intersection of management and technology."
Tuchman has served and supported NJIT throughout the years, and was the recipient of the Alumni of the Year Award (1996), served as a member of NJIT's Board of Trustees (1996-2002) and is currently a member of the NJIT Board of Overseers. A loyal Highlander, Tuchman made his first donation as a young alumnus, just a few years after graduation. Since, he has generously given for scholarships and to support other causes, culminating in a recent gift.
Born in New York but raised in New Jersey, Tuchman currently is the chief executive officer of the Kingstone Capital V, an investment firm with holdings in real estate, banking and international shipping. Additionally, Tuchman serves as chairman of The Tuchman Foundation, which is an umbrella company for the Tuchman Foundation and Parkinson's Alliance, which works closely with Parkinson's research organizations that seek grants and approval from the National Institute of Health. 
"It's that groundbreaking spirit of innovation coupled with a true concern about the world around us, which Mr. Tuchman embodies, that we hope to instill in our students," said SOM Dean Reggie Caudill. "He has succeeded in the professional world and used his resources to make the world a better place for those less fortunate. He has a pioneering way of looking at business and what it means to be successful. We like to call that STEM2, or expanding the power of STEM by adding the management component." 
SOM focuses on delivering highly valued-academic programs that are business focused, technology integrated and experientially driven to educate and prepare students not only to be competitive in today's business world but also to excel and be leaders in the future. SOM is business with the power of STEM.
"Having the School of Management named after my family is a great honor," said Tuchman. "The school focuses on creatively solving new world business problems in our technology driven economy and that is exciting. I look forward to witnessing the new opportunities available to the next generation of entrepreneurs."
Tuchman, who earned his MBA at Seton Hall, devotes his free time to numerous boards and philanthropic enterprises. Some of the organizations include: the American Cancer Society of Mercer County, Trenton Area Soup Kitchen, Parkinson's Disease Foundation at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York, Robert Wood Johnson-Hamilton, the United Nations Association of the United States of America, and the New Jersey Commission on National and Community Service. In banking, he served on Yardville National Bank's board of directors and currently serves as Chairman of First Choice Bank in Lawrenceville. In addition, Tuchman serves as Advisor on National Security to Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney of the 14th Congressional District.  
Tuchman is also the recipient of numerous awards and honors including: being named as Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young LLP (1995); recognized by Cisco Systems for receiving the Grand Prize as part of the "Growing with Technology Awards" program for small and medium-sized businesses that are networked for growth through the innovative use of networking technology and the Internet (1999); and for preparing an extensive case study of Interpool, Inc. for the 2000 Computerworld Smithsonian Collection, which resulted in a nomination for the world Smithsonian Award and the awarding of the Hero medal (2000). 
Tuchman's gift is part of the NJIT NEXT comprehensive campaign, which exceeded its $150 million goal two years early to become the largest fundraising effort in university history. The campaign, which raised $153,700,251 or 102 percent of the goal by June 30, 2015, supports scholarships, faculty fellowships, endowed chairs, programs and facilities. On Nov. 12, 2015, the NJIT NEXT campaign was extended to raise an additional $50 million.
More than 19,000 donors contributed gifts to NJIT NEXT since its launch in July 2007. Of those gifts 75 were leadership contributions of $250,000 or more, including several multimillion-dollar donations. To date, the NJIT NEXT campaign has raised more than $160 million.
One of the nation's leading public technological universities, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is a top-tier research university that prepares students to become leaders in the technology-dependent economy of the 21st century. NJIT's multidisciplinary curriculum and computing-intensive approach to education provide technological proficiency, business acumen and leadership skills. With an enrollment of 11,000 graduate and undergraduate students, NJIT offers small-campus intimacy with the resources of a major public research university. NJIT is a global leader in such fields as solar research, nanotechnology, resilient design, tissue engineering, and cyber-security, in addition to others. NJIT ranks 5th among U.S. polytechnic universities in research expenditures, topping $110 million, and is among the top 1 percent of public colleges and universities in return on educational investment, according to PayScale.com.

Martin Tuchman, Chairman of the Board
 Martin Tuchman graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology (Newark College of Engineering) in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science Mechanical Engineering degree and then earned an MBA from Seton Hall University in 1968.  He went to work at Railway Express Agency (REA) in 1962 as an automotive engineer. While at the agency, he worked for the American National Standards Institute and, together with a group of other shipping engineers, developed the current standard for intermodal containers and chassis. The purpose of the standard was to allow for total interchangeability of equipment in every model rail, truck and ship, as well as structural integrity. It is still being used today.  In 1968, Martin Tuchman and Warren Serenbetz founded Interpool, one of the nation’s leading container and leasing corporations.  In 1978, TBG Holdings, N.V., an international holding company, acquired Interpool, and Tuchman remained as CEO until he left in 1985.  In 1987, he formed Trac Lease, and developed it into the largest chassis leasing company in the United States, with over 150,000 units operating over the road and in rail service.  During 1988, Mr. Tuchman re-acquired Interpool and had it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in1993. Today it ranks as one of the top three International leasing companies in terms of net worth, with headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey and offices strategically located throughout the world.  Currently, Mr. Tuchman is a member of the United Nations Business Council, a council comprised of leading international executives organized to promote understanding and cooperation between business and government.  							 								Mr. Tuchman is a member of the Board of Trustees of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  He serves on the Board of Directors of the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. As Chairman of The Tuchman Foundation and The Parkinson Alliance, he works closely with all Parkinson’s organizations whose scientists select grant applications for National Institute of Health’s (NIH) approval.  In 1995, Mr. Tuchman was honored as Entrepreneur of the Year in an awards program founded by Ernst & Young LLP, and in 1996 was named Alumni of the Year by the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  In 1999, Mr. Tuchman and Interpool were recognized by Inc./Cisco Systems, receiving the Grand Prize, as part of the "Growing with Technology Awards" program for small and medium-sized businesses that are networked for growth through the innovative use of networking technology and the Internet. 

In the beginning of the new millennium, Mr. Tuchman prepared an extensive case study of Interpool, Inc. for the 2000 Computerworld Smithsonian Collection. Through Mr. Tuchman’s effort, Interpool Inc. was nominated for the world Smithsonian Award. Interpool’s material is now part of the Permanent Research Collection on Information Technology at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.  In August of 2000, Mr. Tuchman was elected to the Yardville National Bank’s Board of Director’s and serves on the Executive Committee.  He is also Chairman of the Board of Princeton International Properties, a real estate company with direct ownership, as well as partnership interests, in properties located in Princeton, New Jersey.

The degree programs and research efforts at NJIT’s School of Management (SOM) are directed toward understanding the effects of technology and technological change on business. SOM’s goal is to prepare a new generation of technology-savvy business leaders who are ready for the challenges of the continuing technological revolution.
SOM is committed to providing a solid foundation in business and management within a hands-on, experiential learning environment. Small class sizes and opportunities to co-op or intern with major corporations throughout the region and to work with startup companies in NJIT’s small business incubator allow students to learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and product innovation. Currently, there are over 700 students enrolled in the school’s undergraduate and graduate programs.  In addition, almost 200 students majoring in engineering, computing, social science, and the applied and design sciences are pursuing a business minor.  Joint B.S./M.S. or B.S./M.B.A. options allow students in several departments across the university to accelerate their studies and earn a master’s degree in management or an M.B.A. in addition to their undergraduate degree.
SOM offers an undergraduate program leading to the B.S. degree in Business with concentrations in accounting, finance, innovation and entrepreneurship, international business, management information systems, and marketing.  At the graduate level, SOM offers three programs leading to M.S. degrees in management (M.S.M.) with a variety of concentration areas, business administration (M.B.A.), and an accelerated Executive M.B.A. (EMBA).  The MBA program is available on-campus or online and the E.M.B.A. program is taught on weekends.
