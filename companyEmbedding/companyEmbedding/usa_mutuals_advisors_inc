Fox Business News dedicates day to broadcasting on "The Business of Vice."
Here are the highlights:

Video: Portfolio of Sin, Profitable?
Betting on Vice over Virtue in ETFs
Beware: Shun Sin Stocks At Your Own Risk

Vice Fund portfolio manager Gerry Sullivan was quoted:
There are plenty of people who would rather (give) away their money by putting it into wind mills... We offer a specific type of investment that has done extraordinarily well... We've taken a methodology and stuck to it through very difficult periods... There seems to definitely be a discount in these types of stocks. It may come because they're not as broadly held.
It’s no surprise the Vice Fund was featured in this special segment. At the time of the segment (May 2013), the Vice Fund was in the top 1% among 807 Large Blend Funds for the 10-year period (based on total returns), received from Morningstar a 5-star overall Morningstar rating (among 1451 Large Blend Funds as of 04/30/2013). The Overall Morningstar Rating is based on risk-adjusted returns, derived from a weighted average of the three-, five-, and ten-year Morningstar metrics. Morningstar percentile ranking is based on total returns.
By investing in these defensive growth industries that have historically performed well regardless of economic conditions, the Vice Fund offers investors a portfolio of stocks that we believe are especially attractive in today's volatile markets. The Vice Fund should be viewed as a core holding in an investor's portfolio.

The USA MUTUALS Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any USA MUTUALS Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company including objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Read and consider it carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hardcopy of the prospectus by calling 866.264.8783.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Vice Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The USA Mutuals Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Barrier Fund name was changed to the Vice Fund on October 1, 2016.
S&P 500 Index is considered to be generally representative of the U.S. large capitalization stock market as a whole. You cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges.

The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The Generation Wave Growth Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Because the Generation Wave Growth Fund may invest in third-party investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), open-end mutual funds and other investment companies, your cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing directly in shares of mutual funds in which it invests. By investing in the Fund, you will indirectly bear your share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to indirectly bearing the principal risks of those funds. Please refer to the prospectuses for more information about the Fund, including risks, fees and expenses. Because the Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETFs shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value (“NAV”), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact the Fund’s ability to sells it shares. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could result in losing more than the amount invested.
Takeover Targets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investments in companies that the Advisor expects will be involved in a takeover event carry the risk that the expected event or transaction may not be completed or may be completed on less favorable terms than originally expected, which may lower the Fund's performance. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging markets. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Convertible securities are subject to many of the same risks as regular fixed-income securities, including the risk that when market interest rates rise, the value of the convertible security falls, and in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities generally would be paid after the company's creditors but before the company's common shareholders. Fixed income securities held by the Fund are subject to interest rate risk, call risk, prepayment and extension risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Hedged Emerging Markets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Emerging markets can have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of issues. The Fund invests in small & mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investing in derivatives, specifically call and put options, for hedging purposes to reduce Fund volatility as well as direct investment, may subject the Fund to losses if the derivatives do not perform as expected. The Fund may seek to profit from the occurrence of specific corporate or other events and a delay in the timing of these events, or the failure of these events to occur at all, may have a significant negative effect on the Fund's performance.
The USA Mutuals Barrier Fund, Takeover Targets Fund, Generation Wave Growth Fund and Hedged Emerging Markets Fund are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Vice Fund name was changed to the Barrier Fund on July 29, 2014.
S&P 500 Index is considered to be generally representative of the U.S. large capitalization stock market as a whole. You cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges.

The USA MUTUALS Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any USA MUTUALS Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company including objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Read and consider it carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hardcopy of the prospectus by calling 866.264.8783.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Vice Fund will concentrate its net assets in industries that have significant barriers to entry including the alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gaming and defense/aerospace industries. The Fund may be subject to risks affecting those industries, including the risk that the securities of companies within those industries will underperform due to adverse economic conditions, regulatory or legislative changes or increased competition affecting those industries, more than would a fund that invests in a wide variety of industries. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The USA Mutuals Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Barrier Fund name was changed to the Vice Fund on October 1, 2016.

The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility.
The Generation Wave Growth Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Because the Generation Wave Growth Fund may invest in third-party investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), open-end mutual funds and other investment companies, your cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing directly in shares of mutual funds in which it invests. By investing in the Fund, you will indirectly bear your share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to indirectly bearing the principal risks of those funds. Please refer to the prospectuses for more information about the Fund, including risks, fees and expenses. Because the Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETFs shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value (“NAV”), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact the Fund’s ability to sells it shares. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could result in losing more than the amount invested.
Takeover Targets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investments in companies that the Advisor expects will be involved in a takeover event carry the risk that the expected event or transaction may not be completed or may be completed on less favorable terms than originally expected, which may lower the Fund's performance. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging markets. The Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Convertible securities are subject to many of the same risks as regular fixed-income securities, including the risk that when market interest rates rise, the value of the convertible security falls, and in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities generally would be paid after the company's creditors but before the company's common shareholders. Fixed income securities held by the Fund are subject to interest rate risk, call risk, prepayment and extension risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Hedged Emerging Markets Fund Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Emerging markets can have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that trade a small number of issues. The Fund invests in small & mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks, such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Investing in derivatives, specifically call and put options, for hedging purposes to reduce Fund volatility as well as direct investment, may subject the Fund to losses if the derivatives do not perform as expected. The Fund may seek to profit from the occurrence of specific corporate or other events and a delay in the timing of these events, or the failure of these events to occur at all, may have a significant negative effect on the Fund's performance.
The USA Mutuals Barrier Fund, Takeover Targets Fund, Generation Wave Growth Fund and Hedged Emerging Markets Fund are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Vice Fund name was changed to the Barrier Fund on July 29, 2014.
S&P 500 Index is considered to be generally representative of the U.S. large capitalization stock market as a whole. You cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges.

The Carbon Beach Deep Value Fund invests in smaller companies, which involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. Event driven investments carry the risk that expected events or transactions may not occur as anticipated or unexpected events could adversely impact an investment. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Funds may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. The fund may invest in derivatives which can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks, and, depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative, suddenly can become illiquid. Options may be more volatile than investments directly in the underlying securities, involve additional costs and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed. The fund may invest in ETFs which will fluctuate based on changes in the net asset value as well as changes in the supply and demand of its shares in the secondary market. It is also possible that an active secondary market of an ETF's shares may not develop and market trading in the shares of the ETF may be halted under certain circumstances. The fund will bear its share of expenses and the underlying risks of investments in ETFs and other investment companies. Value investing involves the risk that an investment's intrinsic value may not be recognized by the market.
