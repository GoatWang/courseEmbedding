Credit Products & Services
White Oak provides small and middle market businesses with term loans, asset-based lending, invoice factoring, trade finance, equipment financing and treasury management.  With over $7 billion of capital invested in over 500 companies throughout the U.S. and Canada, we understand the unique challenges facing small and middle market businesses.


Term Loans




Overview

                                            White Oak is a direct lender to middle market companies.  White Oak provides businesses with term loans for growth, acquisition, buyouts, recapitalization and working capital.  Our investment team specializes in customized financing solutions designed to achieve our borrowers' objectives.  

                                            White Oak primarily lends to companies based in the United States and Canada.  For term loans, we target companies with enterprise values between $50 million - $2 billion and/or EBITDA levels below $50 million, competitive positions within their respective markets and industry-leading management teams.  Our product suite includes first lien, split-collateral, unitranche and one-stop financings.  We offer both amortizing and non-amortizing structures.
                                            White Oak's senior debt investments range in size from $10 million to $500 million, though our hold position typically ranges from $10 million to $120 million, with maturities of five years or less.  We invest in a wide variety of industries, including:

                                            
Manufacturing & Industrials
Transportation, Aerospace & Defense
Healthcare
Consumer Durables, Apparel & Retail
Technology, Media & Telecommunication Services
Energy Equipment & Services
Energy & Natural Resources
White Oak International


                                            We work with both sponsor and non-sponsor-backed businesses in various stages of their evolution including growth, maturity and restructuring.
                                        


Cash Flow

                                            Cash-flow loans are based on the projected future cash flows of a business, with the lending limit generally set at projected future revenues and its past ability to generate cash, rather than the liquidation value of the assets.  Cash-flow loans are typically used for funding growth or financing an acquisition.

Hard Assets and Cash Flow

                                            Hard asset loans are collateralized by property, plant and equipment to enhance credit quality.  Orderly liquidation values are assessed through appraisals, which are used to monitor closely the value of the collateral pools in auction-based environments.  Repayment of a loan is generated through cash flow produced by the borrower through its general operating activities.  These loans typically contain contractually determined interest along with amortization schedules.

Enterprise Value

                                            Enterprise value loans are based on the total value of a company, generally determined with reference to comparables in the open market.  These companies tend to be either high growth firms with a particular competitive advantage and compelling market dynamics or larger well established enterprises requiring capital for large asset purchases and working capital needs.  Exit strategies focus on strategic acquisition, sale or cash flow generated by the firm to service the debt.

Opportunistic

                                            Opportunistic loans are typically complex situations, short term bridge loans or bespoke liquidity circumstances that utilize White Oak's fundamental investment approach.  White Oak is here to assist businesses with unique circumstances by offering customized credit solutions.

Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) & Restructuring Financings

                                            Debtor-in-possession (DIP) financings are senior secured obligations to companies undergoing a restructuring under Chapter 11 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code.  These typically have priority over any existing debt, equity or other claims.  When structuring DIP financings, White Oak utilizes the same fundamental strategies that it applies to its senior secured loans.

Asset-Based Lending & Factoring




Overview

Apply Now

                                                Asset-Based Lending (ABL) is a loan, or line of credit, secured by balance-sheet assets:  accounts receivables, inventory or other intangibles, such as intellectual property.  ABL is also commonly known as a commercial finance loan.  Factoring is an ABL financial tool that can help companies unlock working capital and simplify their credit and collections processes.  

                                                White Oak focuses its ABL and/or factoring lending in the following sectors:

                                                
Electronics
Fashion & Apparel

Invoice Discounting

Apply Now
White Oak unlocks valuable working capital through invoice discounting.  Invoice discounting allows companies to maintain control of their invoices and collections processes without having to disclose their financing facilities to their counterparties.  Clients utilizing invoice discounting gain access to the cash tied up in their outstanding invoices and increase overall company liquidity and cash flow.  Invoice discounting has the benefit of keeping a company's credit facility confidential since the company is responsible for collecting and repaying the cash and fees advanced by White Oak.  With invoice discounting, businesses access liquidity secured by their receivables to increase financial flexibility without having to disclose the nature of their financial arrangements to their counterparties.

Apply Now

                                                White Oak provides companies with immediate access to cash through factoring.  Factoring is a financial tool that increases financial flexibility and security with a revolving line of credit secured by a company's accounts receivables.  With access to White Oak's real-time customer credit decisions, clients can grow their customer base and accelerate cash flows while mitigating exposure to bad debts. 

                                                Factoring is generally provided on a non-recourse basis and provides an inexpensive outsourcing platform for customer credit analysis, accounts receivable bookkeeping and the collection of invoices.  White Oak typically purchases the invoices and provides full credit protection on undisputed invoices.  In other situations, White Oak provides credit protection to mitigate the risks of non-payment.  Clients have a direct line to White Oak's credit department and gain 24/7 access to transactions and reporting, including the receipt of invoices, advances and customer payments.

                                                White Oak's supply chain finance  product finances the supply chain gap, which reduces international trade risk to suppliers and increases business between foreign suppliers and U.

U. S. based importers receive open account terms for periods up to 120 days from the bill of lading date, aiding in improved working capital management and payment flexibility.

Inventory Financing

Apply Now

                                                White Oak offers inventory financing in combination with existing collateralized factoring and/or ABL facilities to companies looking to enhance their cash flow and borrowing capacity.  Inventory financing is often used to pay suppliers offering no or limited payment terms or to build inventory in advance of a heavy shipping season.  With inventory financing, it is anticipated that the goods purchased will turn into financeable receivables; however, there are instances in which inventory financing can be used to support the purchase of goods that will be sold through non-traditional wholesale channels. 

                                                The use of inventory financing ensures companies have the necessary liquidity to purchase and hold the proper amount of inventory needed to supply their customers with goods.  Inventory financing is a way for seasonal businesses to stay ahead of the busy season or for companies importing their goods from abroad to deliver on time to their customers.  Coupled with a traditional factoring line of credit or asset-based lending, inventory financing helps ensure that a customer is supported through the entire order-to-cash cycle.

U.S. Import/Export Financing

Apply Now
U.S. import/export financing is a short-term credit solution to bridge the purchase and sale of inventory for companies with limited cash flow.  As an alternative to traditional inventory financing, import/export financing allows businesses to fund the purchase of inventory against confirmed sales orders and helps ensure continued sales growth.  Import/export financing will fund up to 100% of production costs against credit-approved customer sales including, in certain scenarios, duty, freight and labor costs needed to land the goods for shipment to the customer.  This added liquidity ensures that clients are not tapping into valuable equity reserves.

                                            In addition to traditional cash investment solutions, White Oak builds institutional investment portfolios using FDIC-insured certificates of deposit, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S. government, and may yield significantly more than Treasury securities with similar maturities.  White Oak provides a comprehensive, turnkey platform, which includes risk management, accounting, compliance and performance features.

                                            Through White Oak's credit and collection services, customers are screened for credit worthiness and undergo White Oak's own underwriting and due diligence review.  We also assume full credit risk on approved sales, while performing bookkeeping and collections work on our clients' behalf. 

                                            With over a decade of experience and entrepreneurial spirit, White Oak strives to provide comprehensive value-added services and the support to grow.
