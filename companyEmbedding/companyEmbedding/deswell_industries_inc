The Company's segments include plastic injection molding and electronic products assembling. The Company produces a range of plastic parts and components that are used in the manufacture of consumer and industrial products, using various plastic injection technologies, such as film injection, integrated injection and insert injection. The Company's products include plastic components of electronic entertainment products; cases for flashlights, telephones, paging machines, projectors and alarm clocks; toner cartridges and cases for photocopy and printer machines; parts for electrical products, such as air-conditioning and ventilators; parts for audio equipment; cases and key tops for personal organizers and remote controls; double injection caps and baby products; parts for medical products, such as apparatus for blood tests; laser key caps, and automobile components.The Company manufactures electronic products, which include professional audio equipment, including digital audio workstation, digital or analogue mixing consoles, instrument amplifiers, signal processors, firewire/universal serial bus (USB) audio interfaces, keyboard controllers and speaker enclosures; home theatre audio products, such as 7.1-channel audio-visual high fidelity (Hi-Fi) stereo receivers-amplifiers; printed circuit board assemblies using surface mount technology (SMT), automatic insertion (AI) and pin-through-hole (PTH) interconnection technologies, and telecommunication products, such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) keysets for business communications. The Company sells its products in China, the United States, Hong Kong and Europe (the United Kingdom, Norway and Holland) and Canada, among others.Plastic Injection MoldingThe Company's plastic injection molding process consists of approximately three phases, such as mold design and production, plastic injection and finishing. The plastic injection-molding process begins when a customer provides the Company with specifications for a product or part. The Company designs and produces the mold. As of March 31, 2016, the Company used 30 electrical discharge machines (EDMs), 32 computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines and 83 numerical control (NC) milling machines in the mold-making process. As of March 31, 2016, the Company made an average of approximately 20 to 25 molds each month.During the mold-making process, suitable plastic resin for the particular product is selected and purchased. The completed mold is mounted onto injection machines, which are classified according to the clamping force. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 202 injection molding machines, ranging from 30 to 2,000 tons of clamping force, with various machines in the range of 86 to 380 tons. After injection molding, products are finished, which consists of smoothing and polishing; imprinting of letters, numbers and signs through silk screening process; pad printing or epoxy ultra violet cutting, and treating the product with an anti-fog coating.Electronic Products and AssembliesThe Company manufactures and assembles electronic products and electronic assemblies for OEMs. Finished products include consumer and studio-quality audio equipment, Internet protocol private branch exchange (IPBX) and commercial telephone units, network education platforms, Internet protocol (IP) switches and routers. Assemblies consist of printed circuit boards (PCBs) with passive components, such as resistors, capacitors, transformers, switches, and wire, and active components, such as semiconductors and memory chips mounted on them. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of approximately 223,000 square feet of factory space located at facilities in Dongguan, China. In assembling printed circuit boards, the Company purchases printed circuit boards, surface mounted components and chips, and uses automatic insertion and PTH interconnection technologies to assemble various components onto the PCBs. Its manufacturing operations include PCB assembly, wiring and testing. The process is completed by assembling the PCBs into a plastic or metal housing that consists of the finished product.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
