Company Description


First Allied Advisory Services (FAAS) provides an asset management platform that seeks to combine the benefits of active, professional asset management with multiple professional asset management firms and management methodologies. The firm has teams of money managers specializing in variable annuity and variable life insurance subaccount management that their independent advisory representatives (IARs) can utilize. Their IARs also have access to brokerage investment accounts with money management capabilities. FAAS offers exclusive access to the VIP Asset Management platform, which provides an array of variable annuity investment choices.FAAS' IARs use various securities to allocate client assets according to a strategy’s investment objective. These securities may include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), certificates of deposit, Treasury securities, insurance products and alternative investments. The IARs are permitted to use their own method(s) of analysis. Many of them use asset allocation software to help determine objectives and risk tolerance. The software is designed to optimize a client's portfolio and diversify risk across asset classes appropriately. Some asset allocation software may also assist in the selection of specific securities. FAAS' IARs may create investment models based on investment advice provided by First Allied Asset Management, an affiliated registered investment adviser. This might include basic asset allocation advice, or advice regarding specific securities. Accounts may also be managed by certain third-party managers affiliated or related to FAAS or their IARs.
