From Insight, Opportunity
Sophisticated investors turn to Perella Weinberg Partners for distinct alternative investment solutions.







PWP is a leading global institutional asset manager with an unwavering focus on investors’ needs.
We derive an “investment edge” through harnessing the brightest investment minds around the globe. Across investment strategies, we achieve our objectives of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns in a variety of market environments because of our experience, expertise, and disciplined investment approach. Our investors benefit from this edge across public and private instruments, spanning equity, credit, and real asset investments, both through our direct alternatives and our outsourced CIO capabilities. Today PWP oversees approximately $13.1 billion in assets under management.





Agility / Your Outsourced Investment Solution

PWP created the Agility platform to provide your organization an Outsourced Investment Team with comprehensive capabilities that can offer customized programs to meet your individual investment requirements. Our team of professionals has decades of experience and executes a proven and disciplined due diligence process to identify and invest with top managers across asset classes.
Value Proposition
Today, the investment landscape is global and more complex than ever. At many institutions, investment management is often under-resourced, and attracting and retaining specialized in-house investment talent is both difficult and expensive. To be an effective fiduciary now requires an institutional approach involving investment, risk management, legal, compliance, and operational expertise. With Agility, PWP can serve as an extension of your staff or volunteer board and offer customized investment programs designed to complement the remainder of your portfolio.
Approach
The Agility platform’s success is ultimately built upon a close, strategic partnership between you and the Agility Investment Team. With a long-term horizon, we construct diversified portfolios by investing across geographies, asset classes, managers, and positions. We use a detailed, proprietary methodology as well as internal and external tools to measure and manage risk in your portfolio. Combined with the support of experienced legal, compliance, risk management, trading and operational teams, we create a customized investment program to complement and enhance your portfolio.

Asset Based Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy emphasizes capital preservation and cash flow generation from assets purchased at attractive current cash yields and equity-like upside optionality.
Strategy Overview
Our Asset Based Opportunities strategy seeks to uncover mispriced asset based investment opportunities through fundamental analysis and in-depth understanding of asset valuation.
Current market dislocation, including illiquidity, repricing of assets, deleveraging, and regulatory changes, create compelling asset based investment opportunities.
Assets targeted for investment are real assets, including rail cars, aircrafts, vessels, working interests in oil and gas, and commercial real estate and financial assets, including auto loans, credit card loans, franchise loans and equipment lending, small business loans, and other consumer assets.




Diversified Equities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy represents a combination of tactical long/short equity investing and event-driven equity investing within the context of a diversified, low-net portfolio of mid and large cap equities.
Strategy Overview
In the short to medium term the fundamental drivers of stocks can often be diluted or even overridden by other influencers of stock prices such as technicals, macro/thematic factors and behavioral sentiment. As a result, PWP has developed an iterative ‘multiple-lens’ approach that takes into account all of these considerations in developing portfolio construction and managing risk.
To achieve its objective, the strategy invests in both select long and short equity opportunities and event-driven opportunities with a hard catalyst. The strategy leverages significant knowledge synergies between the two strategies and maintains a flexible investment mandate across such strategies in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by the market.

Global Macro
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is highly liquid, investing in equity indices, currencies, sovereign debt, credit, and commodities with a strong focus on risk management in an effort to limit the frequency and severity of drawdowns.
Strategy Overview
The investment strategy is based on fundamental macro-economic research to establish predictive relationships between macro-economic factors and asset returns. These principles are implemented in a rigorous, systematic investment framework. The goal of the strategy is to estimate the dynamics of risk premia across all liquid assets globally in order to identify opportunities to deploy risk to maximize reward. The investment approach incorporates analysis of the current economic environment as well as prediction of the evolution of the business cycle across multiple regions.

TPH Energy Equities Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only diversified equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded energy equities predominately in North America.
Strategy Overview
The strategy was first deployed in early 2015 to take advantage of one of the most severe corrections in the energy markets since the 1980s. It is a fundamentally-driven, concentrated, long-only equity strategy focused on the “best energy ideas” of the Portfolio Manager. The strategy invests in a concentrated portfolio of public equities focused primarily on the upstream and oilfield service subsectors.



Portfolio Manager
Dan Pickering

    Meet Dan  







TPH MLP
Investment Philosophy
This is a diversified long-only strategy focused on midstream energy equities and Master Limited Partnerships.
Strategy Overview
The TPH MLP strategy seeks to generate long-term returns in the form of capital appreciation and income.  The strategy predominately invests in North American opportunities with minimal exposure in developed energy economies outside of the U.S.
The strategy’s unique process and coverage of the entire energy infrastructure spectrum, leads to differentiated stock selection with minimal overlap with leading peer funds.  The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists, and energy professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Energy Infrastructure
Investment Philosophy
This long/short equity strategy is focused exclusively on energy infrastructure subsectors, such as pipelines, utilities, storage, transmission and water, among others.
Strategy Overview
This strategy is in a small universe of hedged, liquid strategies that invests in the energy infrastructure space. The strategy employs an actively managed portfolio with alpha longs and shorts and proactive hedging to isolate desired exposures and reduce broader energy sector, market, and macro risks.
The strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the North American energy sector, with a focus on the energy infrastructure spectrum (i.e., midstream/MLP, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, water, transmission, commodity storage, gathering and processing), through investments in liquid, publicly traded securities.
The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists and energy industry professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain from wellhead to burner tip.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Private Energy Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is a merchant-banking style private equity strategy that makes primarily minority stake, non-control investments in companies across the energy industry.
Strategy Overview
This strategy invests in opportunities that provide capital solutions to companies with attractive risk / return profiles during the current energy correction.  Seeded by one of the largest pension funds in the US, the strategy taps into the proprietary deal flow generated across the TPH platform (Advisory, Capital Markets. and Asset Management) to source attractive investment opportunities. The strategy has three targeted investment scenarios in which it seeks to deploy capital: trough-cycle investment opportunities, development opportunities, and structured opportunities.  The strategy’s opportunistic mandate provides a tactical allocation to energy private equity during the most difficult energy environment since the 1980s.



Investment Committee: Dan Pickering, Chansoo Joung, Bobby Tudor







TPH Midstream Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
Strategy Overview
This is a tactical strategy intended to take advantage of the current energy correction.  The strategy is focused on holding limited, concentrated positions predominately in North American midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).

Our Principles
We are devoted to providing unmatched advisory and asset management services to clients based on high quality independent, financial expertise. Our Business Principles are our values and articulate the Firm’s culture and how we engage with clients. Our entire culture is predicated on trust and experience. Our professionals share an uncompromised dedication to excellence and integrity worldwide.

Business Principles

Clients are everything to us. When we engage with an advisory or investing client, we agree not only to represent them, but to fight for them if the circumstances require it.
We are an entrepreneurial and nimble Firm, unencumbered by bureaucracy and politics. We should use this advantage in every way possible, both internally and externally.
Transparency is vital to our identity, our culture and our success. Complex problems are a prominent feature of our industry and are best solved by early warning, open discussion and a sharing of ideas.
We embrace diversity, not merely because it’s right, but because it creates the most interesting, vibrant and commercial environment.
“I trust you” is the highest compliment we can receive from an advisory client, an investor or a colleague. We should aspire to be the most trusted Firm in our industry.
It takes a special kind of person to enjoy and prosper in our Firm. Our people succeed through their wits, their experience, their relationships and their creativity; without the benefit of armies of people or a huge balance sheet.
While our business model hinges on having experienced senior people with exceptional reputations, our more junior people are the lifeblood of the Firm. We cannot be successful without fully developing the next generation to take the place of the current partners.
Our partnership extends beyond our partners. Every person in the Firm should be devoted, first and foremost, to the Firm’s reputation and well-being. Self-centered or “silo” behavior is antithetical to who we are.
At our Firm, personal ambition and teamwork go hand in hand. Let’s always venerate individual creativity and drive, mindful that each of us, and therefore the Firm, performs most effectively when we operate in a collegial manner.
Every day, we have an obligation to protect, uphold and enhance our reputation.
