Our products are used in a variety of applications across diversified markets, including the building and housing, munitions, automotive, transportation, coinage, electronics/electrical components, industrial machinery and equipment and general consumer markets. We access these markets through direct mill sales, our captive distribution network and third-party distributors. We hold the exclusive production and distribution rights in North America for a free machining, lead-free brass rod product, which we sell under the Green Dot® and Eco Brass® brand names. The vertical integration of Olin Brass's manufacturing capabilities and A.J. Oster's distribution capabilities allows us to access customers with a wide variety of volume and service needs.
We service nearly 1,600 customers in 23 countries across four continents. We employ approximately 1,900 people and operate 11 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers across the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. Closes the Amendment and Repricing of its Long Term Debt Agreement and Amendment of the Asset Based Revolving Credit
Jul 18 17
Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. closed the amendment and repricing of its long term debt agreement and amendment of the asset based revolving credit. The amendments to Term Loan B Credit Agreement and ABL Facility strengthen the company's capital structure and increase financial flexibility. The reduction in interest rate spread, decreased limitations on restricted payments, and the elimination of the leverage covenant reinforces the company's commitment towards enhancing shareholder value. The amendment reduces the price on the $318.4 million Term Loan B Credit Agreement due July 18, 2023 by eliminating the grid pricing, which was at LIBOR plus 425 basis points at current leverage levels, to a straight LIBOR plus 325 basis points. The amendment also eliminates the 4x total net leverage ratio maintenance covenant. Additionally, the company amended its existing $200.0 million ABL Facility due July 18, 2021 to reduce the limitations on making restricted payments, with similar changes being made in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For both the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and ABL Facility, no changes were made to the total amount, tenor, or scheduled amortization of those instruments.


Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Reaffirms Earnings Guidance for the Full Year of 2017
May 4 17
Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 increased to $393.3 million from $328.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in Net Sales were primarily attributable to an increase in pass-through commodity costs. Operating income was $27.0 million against $29.8 million a year ago. Income before provision for income taxes was $22.0 million against $18.9 million a year ago. Net income attributable to company for the first quarter was $17.0 million in 2017, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in 2016. Net income for the current quarter was impacted by a variety of factors including: reduced interest expense; a $3.0 million recovery of insurance proceeds; $2.9 million of unusual medical expenses, ERP transition costs, and increased cost of goods sold due to inventory reductions; the absence of a loss on extinguishment of debt, as was incurred in the first quarter 2016; and a decrease in the provision for income taxes resulting from stock compensation transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $33.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 0.6% compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the net of increased medical costs, increased cost of goods sold resulting from inventory reductions, additional costs incurred related to the A.J. Oster ERP implementation, increased selling, general and administrative expenses, the insurance proceeds, and the benefit from increased volumes. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share was $0.71 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.65 in the prior year. Adjusted sales were $138.4 million against $135.4 million a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $0.71 against $0.65 a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $7.1 million against net cash provided by operating activities of $12.1 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $7.8 million against $7.6 million a year ago.

The company reaffirm its full-year 2017 guidance and expect: Shipment volumes to range from 530 million pounds to 560 million pounds; and Adjusted EBITDA to range from $120 million to $130 million.


Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend for the First Quarter of 2017, Payable on May 25, 2017

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
