What is Ready Mix Concrete
Serving San Jose to San Francisco

We batch concrete when you need it.
Concrete Batch Plant Certified by National Ready Mix Concrete Association
Concrete is a mixture of sand, gravel, cement, and water.

A1 Materials ready-mix concrete is concrete that is manufactured in our
	 batching plant in San Carlos, according to a set recipe, (add mixtures
	 and colors may be added) and then delivered to a work site, by truck mounted
	 transit mixers .
This results in a precise mixture, allowing specialty concrete mixtures
	 to be developed and implemented on construction sites and customized to
	 the application.
A1 Materials ready Mix utilizes up-to-date equipment, such as transit mixer.
The ready mixed concrete, is specifically manufactured for delivery to
	 your home, job site or construction site.
Ready mix Concrete is a combination of water and aggregates comprising
	 sand and gravel or crushed stone. Each of these materials is procured
	 separately and mixed in specified proportions to make concrete.
Ready mix concrete is usually ordered in units of cubic yards, and must
	 remain in motion until it is ready to be poured, or the cement may begins
	 to harden. The ready mix concrete is generally released from the hopper
	 in a relatively steady stream through a trough system. Workers use shovels
	 and hoes to push the concrete into place.
A1 Materials manufactures Ready Mixed Concrete under computer-controlled
	 operations and transported and placed at site using sophisticated equipment
	 and methods assuring its customers numerous benefits.
Why Choose Us
A1 Materials ready mix is focused on providing high-quality service and
	 customer satisfaction.
We will do everything we can to meet your expectations. With a variety
	 of add mixtures to choose from, we are sure your expectations will be
	 met. With our batch plant here in San Carlos, we can ensure the overall
	 high quality of the concrete.
