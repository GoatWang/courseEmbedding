Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund

                                      Energy is one of the largest components of GDP globally, characterized by dynamic international capital and trade flows. The global and interconnected nature of the energy markets require active management and industry expertise to manage these complex investments.
                                    

                                      Expand Your Portfolio
                                    

                                      Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) provides investors the opportunity to access a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. We believe an investment allocation in tangible real assets has long been recognized as a way to add complementary diversification to a portfolio concentrated in stocks and bonds. Under normal circumstances, the Perpetual Fund will invest at least 80 percent of its total assets in debt and equity investments of energy companies and projects. Through an investment focused on energy companies and projects, investors may gain access to a core real assets category with the potential for attractive income and a low correlation with other asset classes.
                                    

                                      An Alternative Income Strategy
                                    

                                    The Perpetual Fund’s investment objective is primarily to provide shareholders with current income; as secondary investment objectives, the Fund will seek to provide capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. While there can be no assurance that the Perpetual Fund will achieve its investment objectives, we believe investing in senior and subordinated debt of energy companies and projects offers opportunities for risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Further, a portfolio broadly allocated among issuers, energy industry sub-sectors and geographies may reduce the risk of a downturn in any single investment having a disproportionate adverse impact on the portfolio value.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will provide increased interim liquidity through a share repurchase program allowing it to be externally managed and continuously offered indefinitely. Pursuant to its share repurchase program, it intends to conduct quarterly tender offers on approximately 20 percent of its weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund is managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company.
                                    

                                      Differentiated by Global Opportunities
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will invest on a global basis primarily in companies and projects located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and Latin America. The Perpetual Fund intends to invest a significant portion of its assets in companies and projects located outside the United States. The Perpetual Fund expects that a substantial portion of its portfolio will consist of senior and subordinated debt, which may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. The portfolio is expected to include primarily floating-rate investments that provide protection in rising interest rate and inflationary environments. The Perpetual Fund’s primary areas of focus will be the upstream, midstream, and power sub-sectors of the energy industry. However, EIG has the experience and technical expertise to invest across the energy value chain on a global basis. The Perpetual Fund’s advisors broadly define the targeted energy company and project investment sub-sectors as follows: (i) upstream; (ii) midstream; (iii) downstream; (iv) power; (v) renewables; (vi) resources; (vii) infrastructure and (viii) other energy.
                                    

                                        Please see our Terms and Conditions of Use for important information.

                                        Investing in the Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) involves risks, including the risk that a shareholder may receive little or no return on its investment or that shareholder may lose part or all of its investment. The following is a list of some of the important risks factors that prospective investors should consider prior to making a decision to invest in the Perpetual Fund. The list is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive. Various other risks also apply; therefore, current and prospective shareholders should read and fully understand the prospectus, which is available here.
                                    
Liquidity Risks

An investment in the Perpetual Fund is not suitable for an investor who needs access to the money they invest;
A shareholder should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time;
Unlike most closed-end funds, the shares are not listed on any securities exchange, and shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their shares regardless of how the Perpetual Fund performs;
If a shareholder is able to sell their shares, the shareholder may receive less than their purchase price and the then-current net asset value per share;
Although the Perpetual Fund has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only 5 percent of outstanding shares will be eligible for repurchase per quarter;

Energy Sector Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in energy companies expose the Perpetual Fund to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Perpetual Fund than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries;
Energy companies are subject to significant foreign, federal, state and local regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations, and their profitability could be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment;
There is an inherent risk that energy companies may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle, and the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of energy companies and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary;
Some energy companies may be subject to construction risk, development risk, acquisition risk or other risks arising from their strategies to expand operations through new construction or development activities, expanding operations through acquisitions, or securing additional long-term contracts;

Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated or unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature;
Increases in interest rates may cause the Perpetual Fund’s investments in fixed-rate debt securities to decline in value;
Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations;
Subordinated investments in debt have lower priority in right of payment to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower, and the cash flows and assets of the borrower may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower;
During periods of declining interest rates, borrowers or issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, which could reduce income and returns;
Below investment grade instruments (commonly referred to as “high-yield” securities or “junk bonds”) may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses. Most investments in which the Perpetual Fund invests will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality. Investments rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment and require active monitoring;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in expectation of a specific event or catalyst can result in losses if the event or catalyst fails to occur or it does not have the expected effect or does not occur in the expected timeframe;
The Perpetual Fund may invest in illiquid and restricted securities that may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price;
The valuation of securities or instruments that lack a central trading place (such as fixed-income securities or instruments) may carry greater risk than those which trade on an exchange;
The value of convertible securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, as well as the market price and volatility of the underlying security;
The value of equity securities may fluctuate in response to factors affecting the particular company in which the Perpetual Fund invests, as well as broader market and economic conditions;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in derivatives have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Perpetual Fund;
Leverage could create the opportunity for higher income and returns for shareholders, but can magnify the effect of any losses;
Triloma, EIG and certain of their affiliates have conflicts of interest in connection with the management of the Perpetual Fund;
The Perpetual Fund is a recently organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with no operating history;

Non-U.S. Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund may be materially adversely affected by market, economic and political conditions globally and in the jurisdictions and sectors in which the Perpetual Fund invests;
Investments in certain securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers or borrowers (“Non-U.S. Securities”) may involve factors not typically associated with investing in the U.S. or other developed countries;
Non-U.S. Securities may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility, illiquidity and changes in value than U.S. securities;
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of and returns on foreign denominated investments;
Credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system (e.g., the “shadow banking system”) could result in increased regulatory and operating costs, which could adversely affect the implementation of the Perpetual Fund’s investment strategies and its income and returns;

Legal and Regulatory Risks

To qualify and remain eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to regulated investment companies (“RIC”) and their shareholders under the Internal Revenue Code, the Perpetual Fund must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements, and failure to do so could result in the loss of RIC status;
The Perpetual Fund’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. Distributions may also be funded in significant part from the waiver of certain expenses that will be subject to future repayment by the Perpetual Fund, thus reducing the amounts available for distribution to future shareholders; and
Legal and regulatory changes, such as those implemented in connection with The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), could occur, which may materially adversely affect the Perpetual Fund.

Accordingly, the Perpetual Fund should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks, and a prospective investor should invest in the Perpetual Fund only if they can sustain a complete loss of their investment.

1The public offering price is effective as of the weekly close beginning July 26, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the prospectus, the public offering price is subject to change based on fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Please refer to the Perpetual Fund’s current prospectus as amended and supplemented for disclosures related to the public offering price.
                        

2Beginning August 1, 2017. The current annualized distribution rate is calculated by dividing the annualized distributions by the current public offering price. The Perpetual Fund’s distributions will be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which could constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. There is no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels.

ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Triloma Financial Group ("Triloma") and EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the "Fund"), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer. 
"Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma's strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners," said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. "Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world."
"The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions," said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. "Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma's team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform." 
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: "We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG's experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis."

         Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds Participate in Northeast Natural Energy Investment

Apr 26, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- ORLANDO, FL--(Marketwired - April 26, 2017) - Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I (the "Funds") announced today their participation, alongside certain other private funds and accounts managed by EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG"), in a $300 million Senior Secured First Lien Note issuance by Northeast Natural Energy and its affiliates ("NNE"). The transaction was originated, negotiated and structured by EIG on behalf of its managed investment vehicles and the Funds.  NNE is a privately held oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of natural gas assets within the Appalachian basin. The floating rate notes mature in five years and are secured by mortgages on the proved reserves in addition to other assets.  "We continue to diversify the Funds' portfolios geographically, across energy infrastructure sub-sectors and different geologic basins," said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of the Funds. "This investment in Northeast Natural Energy is another strong addition featuring natural gas production primarily in West Virginia and western Pennsylvania."  This addition to the portfolio closely follows the Funds' second international investment in a large renewable power project located in the United Kingdom.  About Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I  Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I are unlisted investment companies that invest primarily in global portfolios of privately originated energy company and project debt. Their investment objectives are to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Funds are managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, wholly owned subsidiaries of Triloma Financial Group and EIG Global Energy Partners, respectively. For additional information, please visit trilomaenergy.com.  About Triloma  Triloma is a private investment management firm providing individuals with a unique approach to alternative investment opportunities. Triloma manages and sponsors a group of private and publicly-offered investment programs focused on private equity, real estate and energy investments. Triloma specializes in thorough research, individual access, powerful partnerships and excellent service. Triloma is headquartered in Winter Park, Florida. For additional information, please visit triloma.com.  Triloma Financial Group is the parent company to Triloma Securities, a FINRA-registered broker-dealer, and Triloma Energy Advisors, an SEC-registered investment adviser, (collectively referred to herein as "Triloma"). Triloma Energy Advisors serves as the investment adviser to the Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds.  Securities offered through Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC.  Triloma, EIG Global Energy Partners, and Northeast Natural Energy are not affiliated.  About EIG Global Energy Partners  EIG Global Energy Partners (EIG) is a leading institutional investor to the global energy sector with $14.4 billion under management as of December 31, 2016. EIG specializes in private investments in energy and energy-related infrastructure on a global basis. During its 35-year history, EIG has invested over $23.1 billion in the sector in more than 310 projects or companies in 36 countries on six continents. EIG's clients include many of the leading pension plans, insurance companies, endowments, foundations and sovereign wealth funds in the U.S., Asia and Europe. EIG is headquartered in Washington, D.C. with offices in Houston, London, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and Seoul. For more information, visit eigpartners.com.  This is not an offer. The respective offerings of Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I (the "Funds") common stock can be made solely by means of a written prospectus forming part of the effective registration statement. The prospectuses and their supplements, which contain important information about the Funds, can be obtained upon request and without charge by writing to the Funds at 201 N. New York Ave., Suite 250, Winter Park, FL 32789, or by calling the Funds collect at 407-636-7115. Prospective investors should read the prospectuses and their supplements carefully before investing. Investors are advised to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectuses contain this and other information about the Funds. There can be no assurance that the Funds will achieve their investment objectives.  The Funds' investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated and unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature. Investments in senior secured debt present additional risks, including that there is a higher risk of default than with investment-grade bonds. Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations. The Funds' investments in energy companies expose the Funds to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, a higher volatility of the market and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Funds than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries.  This press release may contain forward-looking statements identified by the use of words such as "outlook," "indicator," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Triloma, EIG and the Funds believe these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Fund's registration statement, as such factors may be updated from time to time in its periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are accessible on the SEC's website at sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in the Fund's filings. Triloma, EIG and the Funds assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events or circumstances.

A Florida-based energy fund is part of a $300 million investment in a West Virginia-based company engaged in natural gas drilling in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.
Trioloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I, along with other EIG Global Energy Partners funds and accounts, initiated and structured a $300 million senior secured first lien note for Northeast Natural Energy, which is based in Charleston, W.Va., and has operational quarters in Morgantown, W.Va.

Northeast Natural Energy has about 49,000 net acres, 27 Marcellus Shale wells and 100 conventional oil and gas wells in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia, according to its website. It was founded in 2009 by Mike John, who is CEO of the company and has also been an executive at Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Triana Energy/Columbia Natural Resources.




Northeast Natural Energy didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.
"We continue to diversify the Funds' portfolios geographically, across energy infrastructure subsectors and different geologic basins," said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of the Funds, in a statement Wednesday. "This investment in Northeast Natural Energy is another strong addition featuring natural gas production primarily in West Virginia and western Pennsylvania."

The Fund's objective is primarily to provide shareholders with current income; as secondary investment objectives, the Fund will seek to provide capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt.
2. The Adviser, a Florida limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
3. The Dealer Manager is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) and will act as the managing dealer of the Fund. The Dealer Manager is under common control with the Advisor and is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Advisor.
4. The applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares, each having its own fee and expense structure, and to impose asset-based distribution and/or service fees, and CDSCs.
5. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or the Dealer Manager or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or the Dealer Manager or its successors,[1] 
           acts as investment adviser or distributor, respectively, and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in compliance with either rule 23c-3 under the Act or rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.[2] 

6. The Fund currently issues a single class of Shares (the “Initial Class Shares”). Shares are currently being offered on a continuous basis pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Act at daily closings at their public offering price per share. The Fund, as a closed-end investment company, does not continuously redeem Shares as does an open-end management investment company. Shares of the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will ever develop for the Shares.
7. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to offer multiple classes of Shares, such as the Initial Class Shares and additional classes. Because of the different distribution fees, service fees, Start Printed Page 27916and any other class expenses that may be attributable to the different classes, the net income attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Shares may differ from each other from time to time.
8. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Board of the Fund may create additional classes of Shares, or may vary the characteristics described of the Initial Class, including without limitation, in the following respects: (1) The amount of fees permitted by different distribution plans or different service fee arrangements; (2) voting rights with respect to a distribution and service plan of a class; (3) different class designations; (4) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of Shares allocated on a class basis as described in the Application; (5) differences in any dividends and net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a distribution and service plan or in class expenses; (6) any sales load structure; and (7) any conversion features, as permitted under the Act.
9. The Fund will not impose an “early withdrawal charge” or “repurchase fee” on investors who purchase and tender their Shares.
10. Applicants state that, in order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to shareholders, the Fund is structured as an “interval fund” and intends to make quarterly offers to repurchase up to 5% of the weighted average number of Shares outstanding in the prior four calendar quarters (or a portion thereof during the Fund's first fiscal year) at a price based on the Fund's net asset value per share, pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act. At the discretion of the Fund's board of trustees, the Fund intends to limit the number of Shares to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of Shares the Fund can repurchase with cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from the sale of its investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase Shares. Repurchases of the Fund's Shares will be made at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms as may be determined by the Fund's Board in its sole discretion.
11. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of Rule 2341 of the Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA Rule 2341”) as if that rule applied to the Fund.[3] 
           Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-end, multiple class funds under Form N-1A.[4] 
           As is required for open-end funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and describe any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or eliminations of sales loads in its prospectus.[5] 
           In addition, applicants will comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.[6] 

12. The Fund and the Dealer Manager will comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund and the Dealer Manager. The Fund or the Dealer Manager will also contractually require that any other distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of Shares of the Fund.
13. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
14. The Fund does not intend to offer any exchange privilege or conversion feature, but any such privilege or feature introduced in the future will comply with rule 11a-1, rule 11a-3, and rule 18f-3 as if the Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(a)(2)(A) and (B) makes it unlawful for a registered closed-end investment company to issue a senior security that is a stock unless (a) immediately after such issuance it will have an asset coverage of at least 200% and (b) provision is made to prohibit the declaration of any distribution, upon its common stock, or the purchase of any such common stock, unless in every such case such senior security has at the time of the declaration of any such distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, an asset coverage of at least 200% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price, as the case may be. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a registered closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule or regulation under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy Start Printed Page 27917and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares.
5. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its shares through asset-based service and/or distribution fees.
3. For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants further submit that the Funds' imposition of asset-based service and/or distribution fees is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Condition
The Fund agrees that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and where applicable, 11a-3 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with FINRA Rule 2341, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

                    Triloma Continues Growth, Signs Lease for Additional Office Space
                




                  ORLANDO, Fla. (March 15, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it has leased an additional 9,500 square feet of space in its current downtown Winter Park office building, bringing its total office space to over 17,000 square feet.
                


                    “Having this additional space available will allow us to accommodate our growing team,” explained managing director, Mike Wood. “More importantly, it affirms our commitment to Winter Park, and we’re excited for what the future holds for us here.”
                  

                    To accommodate its rapidly growing team, Triloma has expanded its offices three times since initially leasing 1,763 square feet of space on Park Avenue in late 2013. One of the ways the firm seeks to promote a healthy work/life balance for its associates is by keeping daily commutes as short as possible, which ultimately led Triloma to its current building just a block away on New York Avenue.
                  

                    Triloma now has 58 associates, each averaging 16 years of investment industry experience. The firm has two public investment offerings currently available, and will continue to offer a series of private investment opportunities this year. Additionally, Triloma intends to introduce new products for 2017 in response to the ever-changing investment and regulatory environments.
                  

                    This announcement comes on the heels of Triloma reporting more than $200 million in equity capital raised in 2016, as well as plans for continued growth and increased involvement in industry advocacy in 2017.

Minerva Rodriguez will serve as fund accounting manager of Triloma Energy Advisors, supporting the accounting and administration of the Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds. Ms. Rodriguez is a seasoned accounting professional with over 20 years of experience in financial management.

                    Triloma Announces 2015 Growth Activity
                




Investment firm exceeds equity raising goals in its first year of operations

                  ORLANDO, Fla. (Feb. 17, 2016) – Triloma Securities (“Triloma”) announced today the results of its syndication activity in 2015. The firm, which commenced broker-dealer operations on April 23, 2015, surpassed its equity raising goals for the year in just over eight months.
                


                    In 2015, Triloma raised more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings, marking one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date. As part of its capital raising efforts, Triloma signed 57 selling agreements with 23
                    different retail broker-dealer firms throughout the year, with investment offerings in energy, seniors housing and land development.
                  

                    “When we founded Triloma, our goal was to create a company where we could improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities. “As we look back at an extraordinary first year for
                    our firm, we have exceeded that goal. We are also proud to have three outstanding investment partners, and to have added to our team some of the brightest and most experienced professionals in our industry.”
                  

                    In the last year, Triloma and its affiliate, Triloma Financial Group, have grown from 9 to 46 associates. These associates include industry veterans who average 15 years of experience in the investment industry. To accommodate this strategic
                    growth, the company relocated to a larger office in Winter Park, Florida.
                  

                    Plans for continued growth in 2016 are well underway, as Triloma prepares to expand its presence in the broker-dealer community.

Overview
The Direxion Daily Energy Bull and Bear 3X Shares seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the Energy Select Sector Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objectives.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
