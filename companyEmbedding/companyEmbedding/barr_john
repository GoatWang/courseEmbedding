	Lures and baits are imitations and preserved forms of baitfish and invertebrates designed to attract predatory fish to a specific location to be caught by the hooks attached to the lures. This is the largest, most varied category of all fishing tackle. The word lure typically refers to the imitations made for casting and trolling. Baits refer to the preserved baitfish and fish parts, along with artificial baits, which may contain natural and synthetic substances to closely imitate smaller creatures and their scents. Some lures and baits can be combined to increase their effectiveness, and many anglers will modify them to create unique actions and profiles to fool heavily pressured fish.
	Most lures are designed for specific tactics, water conditions, depths, speeds and predatory fish species. Lures range in weight from 1/124 oz. to several ounces, and are designed to float, suspend, sink or dive at controlled depths and increments as needed. Lures can be finished in multitudes of surface designs and colors including neons, metallics, glow, ultra-violet, and transparent finishes. The type of finish is dependent on the species they are imitating and the effect intended. They can also have different mechanical designs such as jointed sections, internal rattles, and trailer hooks. The different subcategories of lures and baits available at FishUSA include hard baits, soft baits, jigs and jig heads, spoons, spinners, spinnerbaits and buzzbaits, artificial baits, prepared and cured baits, attractants and cures, worm harnesses, trolling rigs and flies, lure components and flies.
	Most hard baits were originally carved from wood, which has been mostly replaced by plastics in modern lure-making, while metals are used for others. Specific types of hard baits are stickbaits, crankbaits, jerkbaits, swimbaits, jigging lures and blade baits and topwater lures. Soft baits are rubber, silicone or other soft plastics molded into swimbaits, grubs, worms, tubes and other baitfish patterns. Jigs and jig heads are lead, tungsten, or tin weights molded onto specially designed hooks with long shanks to accept soft baits or materials to imitate various creatures. Spoons are metallic “blades” with shapes and bends similar to the eating utensil, and most often imitate swimming or injured baitfish for casting, jigging and trolling. Spinners feature metal blades which spin freely on a weighted or unweighted stiff-wire shaft and create wide-reaching vibrations to trigger fish to chase and strike. Spinnerbaits are combinations of jigs and spinners creating larger profiles and tremendous vibration and motion. 
	Artificial baits are products designed to specifically imitate the look and scent of live bait without the expense and difficulty of storing live bait. These include hard and soft plastic eggs and roe, paste and dough, nuggets made of similar compounds to dough but hold their shape better, larvae and waxies, and baitfish. Prepared and cured baits are natural eggs and roe, baitfish and cutbait, and worms. All of these have been preserved to prevent rot and decay. Attractants and cures are liquids and pastes to coat and spray scent onto lures, preserve and cure your own eggs and baitfish, and to attract fish to specific areas in the water. 
	Worm harnesses are similar to spinners but are pre-made bait rigs with blades, weights, and typically two hooks to hold nightcrawler worms for moderately-sized predatory fish. Some trolling rigs and flies function as large versions of worm harnesses to hold cutbait, while others are designed to have trolling flies or other small profile lures attached for large freshwater and saltwater species. Lure components are offered for the anglers wishing to build their own custom trolling rigs or to modify commercial harnesses.
	Flies make up the final category of Lures and Bait and are specifically designed for fly fishing anglers targeting both saltwater and freshwater species. Dry flies are very light flies designed to float on the water’s surface, imitating flying insects in their adult stage. Nymphs, emergers and wet flies are tied to imitate the early and middle stages of an insect’s life below the surface. Streamers and muddlers are typically larger flies imitating baitfish, crayfish, leeches and other swimming creatures. Worms, sowbugs and scuds are imitations of bugs and worms which often fall from trees overhanging the streambanks. Poppers imitate frogs, mice and large bugs moving and splashing on the surface. Terrestrials imitate grasshoppers, crickets and ants that feed hungry fish when they miss the next blade of grass and end up in the water. Crayfish are wide-profile wet flies imitating the crab-like crayfish that are food for fish in streams, rivers and ponds. Egg patterns imitate single eggs and egg clusters primarily used for trout and salmon.
	The top five lure and bait brands at FishUSA are Rapala, Yo-Zuri, Berkley, Reef Runner and Smithwick.

	Flies are artificial baits designed to imitate insects in look, size and color. These baits are used in fly fishing and are extremely lightweight. Flies can have add-ons like feathers, hair, fur or threads. The shape and design of a fly can range from life-like to no resemblance of an insect at all, and there is normally one single hook attached to the body of the fly.
	The top brands of flies at FishUSA include Gaines, Lively Legz, Otter's Soft Milking Eggs, and Umpqua.

John would have designed the ad campaign if we were to go ahead with it. The results of the focus groups were somewhat ambiguous, but John's razor-sharp perception of the customer's impression of the prototype made it easier to predict market performance and in this case make a no-go decision. I'll never forget his key contribution to the project due to his perception of how the studied segment of customers think. John has the knack to quickly synthesize a pile of information into a concise, compelling and clear statement.

                    Editorial Reviews
                    
                 


Amazon.com
In its prime, Roseanne was the most honest reflection of American life ever shown on television--and also one of the funniest. The second season of this essential sitcom, built around former standup comedian Roseanne Barr, was perhaps its best. The sterling cast--which featured John Goodman (Raising Arizona, Matinee) as Roseanne's husband Dan; Laurie Metcalf (Dear God) as her sister Jackie; and Lecy Goranson, Sara Gilbert, and Michael Fishman as Becky, Darlene, and D.J., her three kids--were confident and eagerly stretching themselves. The writers (including Joss Whedon, later to create Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly) knew how to write smart but credible dialogue and stories; in one episode, Darlene writes a poem that sounds exactly like a 13 year old girl's poetry, yet squeezes your heart. Watch almost any other sitcom and then watch Roseanne; it's startling how much more natural Roseanne feels.  In the season opener, Becky passes gas in front her classmates at school; but that in itself isn't half as funny as the glee that Darlene takes in describing the event--the kind of viciousness that only real families can cultivate. That's the key to Roseanne's success: The utter believability of the relationships. Dan and Roseanne are a loving couple, but their affection works because their fights are just as potent as their flirting. The relationship between Roseanne and Jackie became particularly strong in this season, as Roseanne fought against Jackie's desire to become a cop and meddled in her relationship with her short-lived fiance Gary (Brian Kerwin); Roseanne and Metcalf developed an interplay that could be caring, playful, and bitterly jealous--and sometimes all three at once. The daily urge of parents to both coddle and strangle their kids was thoroughly explored, as was the fusion of need and contempt children feel for their parents. There is one misstep: A dream episode in which Roseanne goes on trial smacks of star ego in a way the show is normally careful to avoid--and makes clear how sharp the other episodes are. The extras are paltry, but this isn't a collection you get for the frills; the show itself lives up to its reputation. --Bret Fetzer

This is the EXACT SAME cheap, poor quality versions that Mill Creek released as a complete series set for $34.99 (When I bought them in 2013) but has since been lowered to $27.49. Thay are bad picture quality! They've changed the intro, the intro font and everything. Original songs not used, etc. This is a CHEAP knock-off. You get what you pay for.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsShe never fails to make me smile.ByCamille &amp; Talamond Roughnighton November 6, 2013Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseIt's Roseanne. The best of the best. I would never disgrace her with a bad review. She is the highlight of the day and brings relief into your life when you feel everything is falling apart. She has you telling yourself, "I'm not the only one who feels that way. Good. That makes me feel better." My advice to anyone who has'nt given Rosanne a chance... Give it a chance. Especially if you have financial stuggles and dreams to do better in life. Roseanne has a good heart and she's real, not fake. It may be a 80's to 90's based T.V show, but there is alot of irratating things in this world, especially today, that still happen since then that effects people nerves and emotions and sometimes the best medicine for this emotional stess, (especially if another cup of coffee does'nt cut it) is a episode or more of Roseanne. I will admit that Roseanne has been there for me even if it's on my T.V. Like I mentioned before, if you have'nt yet, give it a chance.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsCheaper for a reasonByfelicia crabbon April 25, 2015Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI bought this and season 5 to complete my series. The packaging of the individual discs is cheap and disappointing. I have lots of frustration with the discs freezing or playing with no audio which never happens on the Anchor bay sets I have of the other 7 seasons.One up note is each episode has more chapters. I use these as my "bedtime stories" so finding where I dosed off is easier...when it doesn't freeze.I will probably get the other version of these 2 seasons at some point due to the freezing.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsDisc 1 and 3 are fine.

It’s a good one to sit down with the family and watch. I just wish that they would handle the packaging a little differently. They come in a hard case like all movies but inside they have separated the CDs by using these little paper plastic sleeves instead of actual divider inserts. The sleeves are ok and do protect the discs but I just don’t like messing with them. So what I did is just buy some empty replacement boxes that you can buy to hold a number of discs all in one case. I bought ones that have six disc slots and just compiled season one and two of Roseanne into one box. Makes it easier to handle and saves space.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsMill Creek Entertainment did it rightByM.
