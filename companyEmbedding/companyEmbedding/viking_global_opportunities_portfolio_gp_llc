Explanation of Responses:
1. The Reporting Persons (as defined below) do not directly own any shares of common stock (the "Common Shares") of Myovant Sciences Ltd. (the "Issuer").  The Reporting Persons acquired Roivant Sciences Ltd. ("Roivant") common shares (the "Roivant Common Shares") on December 8, 2015.  Roivant directly holds the 37,231,342 Common Shares reported herein. As a result of certain governance arrangements set forth in Roivant's bye-laws, due to the appointment of one or more independent directors (within the meaning of that term under Roivant's bye-laws) to Roivant's board of directors, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to have beneficial ownership over the Common Shares held by Roivant.
2. O. Andreas Halvorsen, David C. Ott and Daniel S.

4. The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of these securities except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, and the inclusion of these securities in this report shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or for any other purpose.
Remarks:
(5) The Reporting Persons are jointly filing this Form 3 pursuant to Rule 16a-3(j) under the Exchange Act.    (6) Each of O. Andreas Halvorsen, David C. Ott and Daniel S. Sundheim is signing as an Executive Committee Member of VIKING GLOBAL PERFORMANCE LLC, on behalf of itself and VIKING GLOBAL EQUITIES LP, VIKING GLOBAL EQUITIES II LP and VGE III PORTFOLIO LTD., and as an Executive Committee Member of VIKING LONG FUND GP LLC, on behalf of itself and VIKING LONG FUND MASTER LTD.

Andreas Halvorsen, David C. Ott and Daniel S. Sundheim have jointly filed with the Reporting Persons on a separate Form 3 filing submitted on the same day hereof.
