Blood  Drives





                          Several of our locations hold on-site blood drives  throughout the year to allow employees an opportunity to participate in this  important cause. The combined total of the blood drives results in more than  500 units and each blood donation helps three patients.



SEAL Legacy Foundation
                            NCI has been a presenting sponsor for the SEAL Legacy Foundation Gala   and Golf Classic Tournament since 2011, supporting the mission to raise   funds for scholarships and financial needs of U.S Navy SEALs and their   families. As a longtime supporter of the U.S. military and the SEALs in   particular Norm Chambers, NCI’s CEO and Chairman was honored in July   2014 with the inaugural SEAL Legacy Foundation Founders Award in   recognition of NCI’s ongoing advocacy for the organization since its   inception. 



Supporting Our Veterans





                            NCI sponsors ConocoPhillip's annual Sporting Clays Tournament which   raises money for veterans. Over the past six years, the tournament has   raised over $800,000 for veteran charities and more than 550 registrants   participate in the fundraiser annually. In addition to monetary   sponsorship, NCI's employees volunteer as part of the 300 plus   volunteers that help at the event. It's just one more way NCI supports   our Veterans. 



Breast  Cancer Awareness





                            NCI has participated in the Susan G. Komen Breast  Cancer Awareness program for many years. Employees who make a minimum $5 donation receive a pink ribbon pin in October, and are comforted  knowing they were able to support a worthy cause.



Caring  is Sharing Christmas Gift Drive






                            Employees volunteer to sponsor children and  adults in need by furnishing gifts at Christmas. The gifts include clothing items and a toy or item that the recipient has requested. Gifts are collected and distributed to the children and adults in  mid-December.

Style Scores:



B Value | B Growth | F Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Here's Why NCI Building Systems (NCS) Stock is a Must Buy


June 14, 2017, 08:44:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 Shares of NCI Building Systems Inc. NCS  , manufacturer of metal products for the North American non-residential construction industry, have been performing well of late. The shares have yielded a year-to-date return of around 9.9%, ahead of the subindustry's gain of 6.6%. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead. The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.   Favorable Zacks Rank & Score    NCI Building Systems currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and also has a VGM scor  e of "B". Here 'V' stands for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.   Estimates Moving Up    Estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 for NCI Building Systems have moved up in the past 30 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts.    The estimate for fiscal 2017 has gone up $1.01, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 42.96%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 has also moved up 5% to $1.32, a year-over-year growth of 30.05%.   Ahead of the Industry       In the last six months, NCI Building outperformed the Zacks classified Building & Construction Products- Miscellaneous  subindustry with respect to price performance. The stock advanced 9.5%, while the subindustry recorded growth of 7.2%.   Upbeat Q2 & Guidance    NCI Building Systems posted adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share for second-quarter fiscal 2017, fourfold the earnings of 4 cents in the prior-year quarter. Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents, leading to a positive earnings surprise of 33%. The company ended the fiscal second quarter with a consolidated backlog of $552.3 million, which is up 3.2% from the prior year and is consistent with the latest growth expectations for fiscal 2017. The company anticipates the robust backlog growth to drive results.    For fiscal 2017, NCI Building Systems hiked revenue guidance range to $1.80-$1.86 billion from the previous range of $1.75-$1.85 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now forecasted in the range of $180-$200 million, up from the prior range of $175-$205 million. The company anticipates performance in second-half 2017 to be better than the first-half performance, on the back of its ongoing cost savings initiatives and opportunities to expand IMP product lines.   Growth Path Ahead    The key leading indicators that NCI Building Systems follows and that typically have the most meaningful correlation to non-residential low-rise construction starts are the American Institute of Architects' ("AIA") Architecture Mixed Use Index, Dodge Residential single family starts and the Conference Board Leading Economic Index ("LEI"). Historically, there has been a very high correlation to low-rise non-residential starts when the three leading indicators are combined and then seasonally adjusted. The combined forward projection of these metrics, based on a nine to 14-month historical lag for each metric, indicates an expected positive growth of 3.0-6.0% for low-rise new construction starts in fiscal 2017.    NCI Building Systems' cost-saving initiatives and opportunities to expand the IMP product lines are likely to drive growth. The company's cost-saving initiatives in manufacturing consolidation and ESG&A are projected to generate $30-$40 million in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2017, these two initiatives are anticipated to generate an incremental $10 million in cost savings. Based on these factors, it will deliver modest growth in underlying volumes with continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in fiscal 2017.   Other Stocks to Consider    Other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are Armstrong World Industries, Inc. AWI  , Masco Corporation MAS  and Patrick Industries, Inc. PATK  . All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Armstrong World has a long term estimated earnings growth rate of 10.06%. Masco has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 16.07% while Patrick Industries has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 10.05%   Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch List    Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Then referred on to hiring manager for three interviews: one with hiring manager, another for a plant tour and a final interview with plant operations/HR. Told at the last meeting I would receive an offer and I would need to respond by the time the hiring manager left for vacation (10 days). Had a followup phone call from HR confirming an offer was coming. One week later, received an email saying that the hiring manager's supervisor would not approve the offer.
