Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC) developed by BioTime’s Singapore-based subsidiary ES Cell International Pte Ltd. (“ESI”). ESI’s hESC are approved by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and can be provided at a research grade or manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (‘cGMP).
PureStem® human Embryonic Progenitors (hEP) that are unique progenitor cells derived from hESC and have a wide variety of advantages over pluripotent hESC as well as adult stem cells in scientific research and potential clinical applications.
HyStem® hydrogel products, a family of unique biomaterials that can be used in the laboratory to mimic a living cell’s natural environment (called an extracellular matrix (ECM)). These materials have applications in cell culture, stem cell growth and tissue engineering. HyStem can be provided at a clinical grade, making them useful for regenerative medicine, cell based therapies, and as delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules.
Cell culture reagents including culture media, small molecules, antibodies and kits for cell differentiation and reprogramming.

					Full Description



BioTime, Inc., incorporated on November 30, 1990, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases. The Company's clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: pluripotent stem cells and cell/drug delivery platform technologies. The foundation of its cell delivery platform is its HyStem cell and drug delivery matrix technology. Its clinical programs are targeting three primary sectors, aesthetics, ophthalmology and cell/drug delivery.The Company's lead facial aesthetics product, Renevia, is a potential treatment for facial lipoatrophy. It is in a pivotal clinical trial in Europe to assess its safety and efficacy in restoring normal skin contours in patients whose subcutaneous fat, or adipose tissue, has been lost due to the use of certain drugs often used to treat patients with human immune virus (HIV). OpRegen is its lead product for ophthalmological disorders. It is a suspension of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that are derived from pluripotent stem cells. RPE cells form the back lining of the retina, and support the function of photoreceptors (rods and cones). RPE cells can be damaged and lost in various forms of retinal degeneration. In addition to Renevia, the Company has two additional primary programs utilizing its HyStem technology. HyStem- brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a preclinical development program for the delivery of recombinant human BDNF directly into the stroke cavity of patients with the goal of aiding in tissue repair and functional recovery. ReGlyde is in preclinical development as a device for viscosupplementation and a combination product for drug delivery in osteoarthritis (OA).The Company's subsidiary Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Asterias) is focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs, which have the potential to address areas of unmet medical need in the fields of neurology and oncology. Asterias' lead products are AST-OPC1, AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2. The Company's affiliate OncoCyte Corporation (OncoCyte) is developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. The Company is also developing technology related to an area of regenerative medicine relevant to diseases of aging.Renevia is being developed to address an immediate need in facial aesthetic procedures, and certain reconstructive surgeries, by improving the process of transplanting a patient's own fat progenitor cells to provide a natural feeling and longer lasting benefit. OpRegen is in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AST-OPC1 consists of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection. AST-VAC1 is an Asterias' autologous (patient-specific) cancer vaccine designed to stimulate a patient's immune system to attack telomerase. Asterias is developing AST-VAC1 for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the common form of acute leukemia in adults. AST-VAC2 is developed by Asterias as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from human embryonic stem (hES) cells that can be modified with any antigen. The Company, through LifeMap Sciences, Inc., offers biomedical knowledgebases, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis and interpretation solutions. Its subsidiary Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. is engaged in providing products to treat age-related macular degeneration. The Company's subsidiary ES Cell International Pte. Ltd. offers stem cell products for research, including clinical grade cell lines.The Company competes with Astellas Pharma Inc., Integrated Diagnostics, OncImmune Ltd., Exact Sciences Corp, Gensignia Life Sciences, Inc., Veracyte, Inc., Hospira, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Sanofi-Aventis, Baxter International, Alpha Therapeutics, B. Braun and CJ Health.

History[edit]
BioTime was founded in 1990 in Berkeley, California.[5] The company initially focused on developing processes to cool living bodies, and related projects.[1]
In 2007, the company appointed Michael D. West, Ph.D, as chief executive officer. West had been CSO and CEO of Advanced Cell Technology (and prior to that had founded Geron (NASDAQ: GERN), for which he secured venture capital investment from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Venrock.[6][7]
Also in 2009, BioTime secured $4.72 million in grant funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to expand its "ACTCellerate" program, which it had acquired the previous year from Advanced Cell Technology[8] for $250,000 plus royalties.[9]
In October 2010, BioTime entered a license agreement with Teva (NYSE: TEVA) to develop and market BioTime's OpRegen for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,[10] an effort that in 2013 received $1.5 million in funding from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist.[11]
In 2013, BioTime acquired the stem-cell assets of Geron Corporation, with the aim of restarting its embryonic stem cell-based clinical trial for spinal cord injury.[12]
Subsidiaries[edit]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
