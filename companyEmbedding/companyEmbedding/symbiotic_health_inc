The connections between the microbiome and human health are inspiring a new generation of therapeutics comprised of novel peptides, proteins, and cells.  Many of these agents face obstacles to commercialization that Symbiotic Health is uniquely poised to address.  We identify promising therapeutic candidates and advance them from laboratory proof-of-concept to clinic-ready product.  We focus on the development of orally administered biologic therapeutics. Historically, biologics (therapeutics comprised of proteins and cells) have not been amenable to oral administration due to the limitations of existing drug delivery technologies. 







Symbiotic Health has developed a proprietary oral enteric delivery platform for biologics and cells. Our process maintains the therapeutic agents in their solubilized or hydrated state, avoiding losses in functional activity through processing or gastrointestinal transit.

In 2015 the founders of Symbiotic Health demonstrated the utility of an oral formulation of fecal derived bacteria to treat recurrent C.difficile infection.







Following that success, Symbiotic Health developed a 2nd generation capsule formulation which is currently being used for pre-clinical studies of our lead therapeutic candidate, SHP-01.The 2nd generation formulation is compatible with both protein and cellular cargo, enabling Symbiotic to actively negotiate with academic and private entities to secure our next lead.  SHP-01 is the lead therapeutic in the Symbiotic Health pipeline for the treatment of acute and recurrent C.difficile infection.  It is a novel narrow spectrum antimicrobial enzyme (lysin) which targets diverse clinical strains of C.difficile while sparing healthy gut bacteria required for health.  This molecule was invented in the laboratory of Vincent Fischetti at The Rockefeller University.  Symbiotic Health has an exclusive license for commercial development of this molecule for human therapeutic applications.Unlike newly developed antibody and phage therapeutics, SHP-01 is a stable oral formulation, facilitating administration.SHP-01 can be co-administered with antibiotics, the current standard of care, unlike bacteria-based therapies.As concerns about antibiotic resistance are paramount in modern healthcare, SHP-01 belongs to a class of molecules that have no known resistance mechanism in the environment.SHP-01 offers several advantages over both traditional and newly developed therapies for C.difficile.SHP-01 is intended for the treatment of acute and recurrent infection.  Antibiotics are currently used for the treatment of acute infection.  Unlike antibiotics,  SHP-01 is microbiome sparing.

Since 1996 Symbiotic Systems, Inc. has been dedicated to creating, finding 
  and distributing alternative products?which are designed to enhance your life. 
  Some products produce a cost savings when used which makes them an excellent 
  investment rather than an expense. Many of our products deal with health issues, 
  but not all.
  Do you have unique formations building 
  up on your faucets and minerals clogging your pipes,
 we can fix that with our magnetic water 
  conditioning system we've sold
  with a money back guarantee for nine years now.
  And... it is a no bones about it money saving investment.
 We firmly believe that there is a greater knowledge in this world and search 
  the world to bring this knowledge to you. Some information presented is pure 
  knowledge, we dont sell a product associated with the knowledge, but feel it 
  this is information you can use. 


We are not doctors. We are information junkies who

 We believe that the term alternative?should be applied to drugs rather than 
  natural treatments. We feel that natural treatments should be your first option 
  or line of defense before using any drugs which may produce profound side effects. 
  Prevention is paramount to good health. Further, we believe that natural treatments 
  are best utilized in addition to the western approach to medicine. Knowledge 
  is a tool and it would be foolish to ignore the benefits each approach offers. 



    When we are talking about personal health,
    our philosophy is; whatever works (and proven safe).

Our Public Service
Our National Debt. Current 
  and to the penny as of the moment you visit. In September 1996, the US national 
  debt went past $5 TRILLION for the first time ever. This 
  should concern you. Take a moment to visit. It's very eye opening. Make 
  note of the dollar amount and hit reload. Watch how much our debt goes up in 
  the time it took your screen to reload!
 As a nation, we owed: 
 $5,193,289,504,811.98 as of 7:10 p.m. on September 23, 1996.
  $5,346,464,964,281.64 as of February 28, 1997
  $5,462,624,123,747.44 as of December 4, 1997.
  $5,531,660,484,841.88 as of March 24, 1998
  $5,719,424,838,725.42 as of August 29,2001 (About two 
  weeks before 9/11)
$6,874,577,948, 531.60 as of November 11, 2003 at 11:42 p.m. GMT
  $6,874,597,706,207.99 as of November 12, 2003 at 
  12:00:13 a.m. GMT (18 minutes time difference) 
$7,441,543,658,872.86 as of October 28, 2004 at 2:04 p.m. GMT growing at 
  $1.67 billion per day since September 30, 2003! 

U.S. debt was growing 
  at $706 million a day on February 28, 1997. August 29, 2001 the debt really 
  started to climb rapidly. News is, the "tax relief" check President Bush gave 
  us put us back in the hole. We, as a nation would have saved way more, if he 
  just would have paid down the debt. You still need to contact your representatives 
  and tell them it's your money! They need to spend it wisely so our children 
  don't shoulder the debt!
The war on terror has become a war on the U.S. Taxpayer with 
  Halliburton
  earning a cut of every dollar they spend. The more they spend, the more they 
  make. It isn't right.

Create Job Alert for Symbiosis Health inc. 
























 
Symbiosis Health is a hot new Chicago startup aimed at making healthcare truly affordable with a refreshingly simple idea:  Patients with a high deductible health plan can compare cost from multiple providers, schedule online and pre-pay for medical services.  We’re a recent graduate of Blueprint Health, a Healthcare accelerator based in New York.  We have a solid business plan, a strong set of investors backing the company. Over the next several months, we’ll be building a site that connects patients, providers, and insurers into a marketplace for care.
