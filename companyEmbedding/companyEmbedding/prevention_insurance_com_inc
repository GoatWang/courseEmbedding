(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the registrant will be achieved.  Description of Business  Prevention Insurance.com ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 7, 1975, under the name Vita Plus, Inc. The name was later changed to Vita Plus Industries, Inc. and in 2000 the Company's name was changed to its current name Prevention Insurance.com.  On March 9, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Chee Chau Ng to the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, on that same date, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Ng as its President (Chief Executive Officer), Treasurer (Chief Financial Officer) and Secretary, replacing Mr. Yik Kei Ong who had resigned in all capacities as an officer of the Company on that date. As President of the Company, Mr. Ng assumed the role of Chairman of the Company Board of Directors.  Effective May 24, 2016, Mr. Yik Kei Ong resigned as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Ong did not resign as a result of any disagreement with the Company over any matter related to its operations, policies or practices.  On or about September 19, 2016, three of our shareholders, owning 15,638,084 shares of common stock, or approximately 70% of the total outstanding shares, on the record date (September 16, 2016), approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to change our corporate name from Prevention Insurance.com to AIM BIG Resources, Ltd. (the "Charter Amendment"). On November 18, 2016, we filed a Definitive Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We mailed the Definitive Information Statement to our shareholders on November 21, 2016. The Charter Amendment will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on or after December 12, 2016 (20 days after the date of the mailing of the Information Statement). If the proposed Charter Amendment were not adopted by written consent, it would have been required to be considered by the Company's stockholders at special stockholders' meeting convened for the specific purpose of approving the Charter Amendment.  The elimination of the need for a special meeting of stockholders to approve the Charter Amendment is made possible by Section 78.320(2) of the Nevada Revised Statute (the "NRS") which provides that the written consent of the holders of outstanding shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders having at least a majority of the voting power may be substituted for such a special meeting. Pursuant to Section 78.390 of the NRS, a majority of the voting power is required in order to amend the Company's Articles of Incorporation to create its preferred shares. In order to eliminate the costs and management time involved in holding a special meeting and in order to effect the Charter Amendment as early as possible, the Board of Directors of the Company voted to utilize the written consent of the holders of a majority of voting power.  As stated in its quarterly and annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company remains a "shell company" and its principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not entered into any letter of intent or formal or definitive agreements with any party, regarding business opportunities for the Company. Moreover, the Company believes that a business combination will not occur at any time prior to April 1, 2017, however, the Company cannot predict that such business combination will occur on or about such date or at all, nor can the Company predict the type of business operation or terms and conditions of any such combination.  The Company common stock will continue to trade on the OTC-QB Tier of the Pink Sheet Markets under the trading symbol "PVNC."  The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  The Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  (i) filing Exchange Act reports, and  (ii) investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.  We believe we will be able to meet these costs through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As January 31, 2017, the Company has $0 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management's plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  The Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  Our management has not entered into any agreements with any party regarding a business combination. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  We will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide audited financial statements at or within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. We are subject to all the reporting requirements included in the Exchange Act. Included in these requirements is our duty to file audited financial statements as part of our Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition, as well as our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the target business, the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable at the discretion of our present management.  A business combination with a target business will normally involve the transfer to the target business of the majority of our common stock, and the substitution by the target business of its own management and board of directors.  The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.  On September 19, 2016, three of our shareholders, owning 15,638,084 shares of common stock, or approximately 70% of the total outstanding shares, approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to change our corporate name from Prevention Insurance.com to AIM BIG Resources, Ltd. (the "Charter Amendment"). On November 18, 2016, we filed a Definitive Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We mailed the Definitive Information Statement to our shareholders on November 21, 2016. The Company expects that the Charter Amendment will be filed with the Nevada Secretary of State following FINRA's approval of the Charter Amendment.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 31, 2017 and April 30, 2016, the Company had no assets. The Company's current liabilities as of January 31, 2017 totaled $108,717, $7,024 relating to accounts payable and accruals and $101,693 of advances from related party. This compares with current liabilities of $16,939 as of April 30, 2016, comprising $5,242 of accounts payable and $11,697 due to a related party. The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016:   Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 31, January 31, 2017 2016 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (89,996 ) $ (59,544 ) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities - - Net Cash Provided in Financing Activities 89,996 59,028 Net Change in Cash $ - $ (516 )  Operating Activities  During the nine months ended January 31, 2017, the Company incurred a net loss of $91,778 which, after adjusting for an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,782, resulted in net cash of $89,996 being used in operating activities during the period. By comparison, during the nine months ended January 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $253,168 which after adjustments for $199,500 non-cash amortization of debt discount, a $3,413 increase in accrued interest and a $9,289 decrease in accounts payable resulted in a net cash of $59,544 being used in operating activities  Investing Activities  The Company neither generated nor used funds in investing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016.  Financing Activities  During the nine months ended January 31, 2017, the Company received $89,996 from advances from related party. By comparison during the nine months ended January 31 2016, the Company received $55,000 by way of a convertible loan from a related party, $4,256 by way of advances from a related party and repaid $228 to a related party.  The Company is dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.  Results of Operations  The Company has not conducted any active operations since the divestment of the ATM machine sales operations as of October 31, 2008. No revenue has been generated by the Company during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.  For the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016  During the three months ended October 31, 2017, the Company incurred a net loss of $29,643, comprised of general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company's periodic reports.  During the three months ended January 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $227,907, comprised of general and administrative expenses of $29,632, including legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company's periodic reports and interest expense of $198,275.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses of $29,643 incurred in the three months ended January 31, 2017 were broadly comparable to $29,632 incurred during the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Interest Expense  During the three months ended January 31, 2017, no interest bearing debt was outstanding and consequently no interest expense was incurred during the period. By comparison, during the three months ended January 31, 2016, the Company incurred interest expense of $198,275 related to the amortization of debt discount and interest accrued in respect of the $199,500 convertible loans, related party, outstanding and converted into shares of our common stock during the period.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the registrant will be achieved.  Description of Business  Prevention Insurance.com ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 7, 1975, under the name Vita Plus, Inc. The name was later changed to Vita Plus Industries, Inc. and in 2000 the Company's name was changed to its current name Prevention Insurance.com.  The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  The Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  (i) filing Exchange Act reports, and  (ii) investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.  We believe we will be able to meet these costs through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As July 31, 2016, the Company has $0 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management's plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  The Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  Our management has not entered into any agreements with any party regarding a business combination. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  We will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide audited financial statements at or within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. We are subject to all the reporting requirements included in the Exchange Act. Included in these requirements is our duty to file audited financial statements as part of our Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition, as well as our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the target business, the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable at the discretion of our present management.  A business combination with a target business will normally involve the transfer to the target business of the majority of our common stock, and the substitution by the target business of its own management and board of directors.  The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of July 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, the Company had no assets. The Company's current liabilities as of July 31, 2016 totaled $52,865, $17,963 relating to accounts payable and $34,902 of advances from related party. This compares with current liabilities of $16,939 as of April 30, 2016, comprising $5,242 of accounts payable and $11,697 due to a related party. The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015:   Three Three Months Months Ended Ended July 31, 2016 July 31, 2015 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (23,205 ) $ - Net Cash Used in Investing Activities $ - $ - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 23,205 $ - Net Change in Cash $ - $ -  Operating Activities  During the three months ended July 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $35,926 which, after adjusting for an increase in accounts payable of $12,721 resulted in net cash of $23,205 being used in operating activities during the period. By comparison, during the three months ended July 31, 2015, the Company incurred a net loss of $17,660 which after adjustments for $507 non-cash amortization of debt discount, a $288 increase in accrued interest and a $16,865 increase accounts payable resulted in a $0 net use or generation of funds from operating activities  Investing Activities  The Company neither generated nor used funds in investing activities during the three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015.  Financing Activities  During the three months ended July 31, 2016, the Company received $23,205 from advances from related party. By comparison during the three months ended July 31, 2015, the Company neither generated nor used funds in financing activities.  The Company is dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.  Results of Operations  The Company has not conducted any active operations since the divestment of the ATM machine sales operations as of October 31, 2008. No revenue has been generated by the Company during the three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JULY 31,
2016


(Unaudited)


 

NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

Nature of
Business

 

Prevention
Insurance.Com (the “Company”) was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Nevada in 1975 as Vita Plus Industries,
Inc. In March 1999, the Company sold its remaining inventory and
changed its name to Prevention Insurance.Com. In 2005, the Company
added a second line of business and had been focused on its
development of its ATM machine sale operations. On December 28,
2007, the Company entered into an agreement wherein the Company had
a change in control which resulted in the divestiture of the ATM
division “Quick Pay”. The Company divested itself of
the ATM machine sales operations on October 31, 2008.

 

The
Company’s business is to pursue a business combination
through acquisition, or merger with, an existing company. No
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in
locating or negotiating with any target company.

 

Effective
December 8, 2015, a change of control occurred with respect to the
Company. Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into
by and among the Company, Paragon Capital LP
(“Seller”), and Yik Kei Ong (“Buyer”, as
nominee for certain third parties), Seller assigned, transferred
and conveyed to Buyer, as nominee, 2,109,286 shares of common stock
of Company and convertible notes of the Company totaling $199,500.
The convertible notes were convertible into common stock of the
Company at $0.01 per share for a total of 19,950,000 shares of
common stock. On the closing of the above transaction, Mr. Alan
Donenfeld, the then sole officer of Seller, resigned in all officer
capacities from the Company and Yik Kei Ong was appointed interim
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
Immediately following the closing of the transaction, the
convertible notes ($199,500 in principal amount) were converted
into 19,950,000 shares of common stock of the Company. After giving
effect to the above described transaction, the controlling
shareholders of the Company are Wooi Huat Teow, Chee
Chow Teow and Ee Meng Teow.

 

On March
9, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Chee Chau Ng to the
Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, on that same date,
the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Ng as its President (Chief
Executive Officer), Treasurer (Chief Financial Officer) and
Secretary, replacing Mr. Yik Kei Ong who had resigned in all
capacities as an officer of the Company on that date. As President
of the Company, Mr. Ng will assume the role of Chairman of the
Company Board of Directors.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist
in the understanding of the financial statements. These policies
conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and have been consistently applied.

 

Interim
Financial Statements

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim
financial information in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In
our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been
included. While we believe that the disclosures presented herein
are adequate and not misleading, these interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and the
footnotes thereto contained for the year ended April 30, 2016
included our Form 10K filed on August 15, 2016. Operating results
for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of
the results for the full year.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company maintains cash balances in a non-interest bearing account
that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. For the
purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered
to be cash equivalents.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

The fair
value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable
approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due
to their short maturity.

 

Beneficial
Conversion Feature

 

If the
conversion features of conventional convertible debt provides for a
rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this
feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature
(“BCF”). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt
discount. In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded
net of the discount related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes
the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt using
the effective interest method.

 

Net Loss
per Share Calculation

 

Basic net
loss per common share ("EPS") is computed by dividing loss
available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares
were issued. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common
shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

Four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has
occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3)
and (4) are based on our management's judgments regarding the fixed
nature of the selling prices of the products and services delivered
and the collectability of those amounts.

 

For the
three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not
recognize any revenue.

 

Stock-Based
Compensation

 

The
Company recognizes compensation cost based upon the fair value of
stock options at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing
model. During the three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company did not issue any shares for services nor did the Company
issue any options as stock based compensation to any officers,
directors, or non-employees.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit
carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income
in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to
be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more
likely than not to be realized.

 

Uncertain
Tax Positions

 

The
Company evaluates tax positions in a two-step process. The Company
first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical
merits of the position. If a tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and
penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to
result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as long term
liabilities in the financial statements.

  

Subsequent
Events

 

The
Company has evaluated all transactions from July 31, 2016 through
the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event
disclosure consideration.

 

Recently
Accounting Pronouncements

 

There were
various accounting standards and interpretations issued during
2016, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, operations or cash
flows.

NOTE 2.
GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. For the three months ended July 31, 2016, the Company
reported a net loss of $35,926 and has reported an accumulated
deficit of $4,642,496 as of July 31, 2016. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome
of these uncertainties. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional
sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another
company and ultimately achieve profitable operations. No assurances
can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or
negotiating with any target company.

 

NOTE 3.
ADVANCES DUE TO RELATED PARTY

 

As of
April 30, 2016, an entity related to the Company’s
controlling shareholders has advanced funds totaling $11,697 to the
Company to meet its working capital requirements. The advances are
unsecured, interest free and due on demand.

 

As of July
31, 2016, the same entity has advanced funds totaling $34,902 to
the Company to meet its working capital requirements. The advances
are unsecured, interest free and due on demand.

 

Subsequent
to July 31, 2016 through the date these financial statements were
issued, the same entity advanced further funds totaling $24,465 to
the Company to meet its working capital requirements.

 

NOTE 4.
COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES

 

Corporate
Office Space

 

For three
months ended July 31, 2016, the Company maintained office space in
Kuala Lumpor, Malaysia provided by the Company’s controlling
shareholder at no cost to the Company.

 

For the
three months ended July 31, 2015, the Company maintained office
space in New York, New York with the Company’s then majority
shareholder at no cost to the Company.

 

Accordingly,
for the three months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recognized no rent expense.

 

NOTE 6.
STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT

Stock

 

As of July
31, 2016, the Company was authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

Certain
statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are
“forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in regard to the
plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of the registrant to be materially different from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included
herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous
risks and uncertainties. The Company’s plans and objectives
are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued
expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future
economic, competitive and market conditions and future business
decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict
accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions
could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report
will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significan
