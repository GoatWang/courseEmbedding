DETROIT -- Powertrain components supplier Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. will consolidate its eight brands following a merger nearly two years ago. All brands will fall under the MPG moniker, the company said Wednesday.
The company's brands include HHI, Grede, Cloyes, Metaldyne, Jernberg, Impact Forge, NovoCast and FormTech. All legal entities and reporting segments in the company will remain intact.
Metaldyne, now based near Detroit in Southfield, Mich., was acquired by private equity firm American Securities LLC in 2012 and merged with Grede Holdings LLC and HHI Group Holdings LLC -- both majority-owned by American Securities, to form MPG in 2014. 
"We wanted to highlight how well the integration is going (with the brand consolidation)," said David Gann, a spokesman for MPG. "This is not a restructuring."
The company specializes in ductile iron castings for steering knuckles, control arms and differential cases, and also produces forgings, powdered metal parts and machined components. MPG's customers include Ford Motor Co., General Motors, FCA and the ZF Group. The company also has customers in the industrial sector. 
MPG has about 12,000 employees working in 60 locations in 13 countries across North and South America, Europe and Asia. MPG was named one of Crain's Detroit Business fastest growing companies in 2016.
MPG ranks No. 76 on the Automotive News list of the top 100 global suppliers with worldwide sales to automakers of $2.5 billion in 2015.
