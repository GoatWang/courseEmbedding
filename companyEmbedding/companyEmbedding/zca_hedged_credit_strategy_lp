FIA Global Fixed Income (USD Hedged)

The FIA Global Fixed Income (USD Hedged) strategy is managed by First International Advisors, LLC. This lower-risk strategy is aimed at capitalizing on the opportunity set from global bond markets while hedging all FX exposure back to the U.S. dollar and to exceed the return from the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Broad 1-10 Year Bond Index (Hedged to US$). The currency exposure is managed at all times to negate as near as possible all currency risk using forward foreign exchange transactions and to provide the best possible yield enhancement. The investment team uses proprietary investment technology, experienced investment professionals, and active management within a structured process.
