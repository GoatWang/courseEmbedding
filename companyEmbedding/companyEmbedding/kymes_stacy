 Educational Background



 


Harding University

                  Harding University is a private Christian institution of higher education committed to the tradition of the liberal arts and sciences. It is composed of the following academic units: a College of Allied Health, a College of Arts and Humanities, a College of Bible and Ministry, a College of Business Administration, a College of Education, a College of Nursing, a College of Pharmacy, a College of Sciences; and graduate and professional programs in business, education, marriage and family therapy, ministry, pharmacy, physician assistant studies, physical therapy, speech-language pathology, and theology. The University serves a diverse, coeducational student body from across the United States and around the world, although the primary constituency for students and financial support is the fellowship of the churches of Christ. The board of trustees, the administration and the faculty believe that the freedom to pursue truth and high academic achievement is compatible with the Christian principles to which the University is committed. The faculty is dedicated to excellence in teaching, scholarship and service, and to their role as models of Christian living. The University community seeks to provide an environment that both supports students and challenges them to realize their full potential. Thus, Harding's mission is to provide a quality education that will lead to an understanding and philosophy of life consistent with Christian ideals.                





 Career History



Executive Vice President, Corporate Banking

                                    1996 - Current                


BOK Financial Corporation


                  BOK Financial's overall growth objective is to increase long-term value by building on existing market leadership throughout the state of Oklahoma and expanding into high-growth metropolitan areas in the region. BOK Financial began its regional expansion with two small acquisitions in the Dallas area in 1997 and has grown average assets in Texas to nearly $5 billion. Today over half of BOK Financial's loans are attributed to markets outside of Oklahoma.

One of BOK Financial's notable strengths is its diverse revenue streams. Noninterest revenue consistently represents more than 40% of total revenue. BOK Financial offers a broad range of financial products and services, including cash management services, mortgage banking, and brokerage and trading services to middle-market and small businesses, financial institutions and consumers. BOK Financial's vision is to provide sophisticated nationally competitive products with personal responsive client service.

BOK Financial's balanced strategies have withstood varying economic cycles. By staying focused on core objectives which include investing in top talent, maintaining diverse revenue streams and expanding its presence in the region, BOK Financial has grown from a $2 billion Oklahoma bank to a $25 billion regional financial services company. BOK Financial's proven strategies create value for shareholders, clients, employees and communities
