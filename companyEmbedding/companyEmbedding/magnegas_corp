MagneGas
MagneGas™ is an innovative green gas that is a replacement to acetylene. As well as being both safer and more cost effective than acetylene, it also cuts faster and cleaner.
MagneGas™ also improves the performance of equipment and the productivity of employees by concentrating the heat at the precise point of the cut, this creates a higher quality cut. MagneGas™ is safer because there is limited flashback during cuts and has a lower toxicity than acetylene. Since MagneGas™ costs less than acetylene and uses less oxygen it is very cost competitive and saves users money.

Magnegas Corporation
Tampa-based MagneGas Corporation (NASDAQ: MNGA) is a technology Company that counts among its inventions, a patented process that converts liquid waste into hydrogen based fuels.
The Company currently sells MagneGas® into the metal working market as a faster, safer, and hotter replacement to acetylene. In addition, the Company is developing a variety of ancillary uses for MagneGas® fuels by utilizing its high flame temperature for co-combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and other advanced applications.
It is also selling equipment for the sterilization of bio-contaminated liquid waste (such as pig manure or leachates) for various industrial and agricultural markets.













We have been using MagneGas 2® at our off-site maintenance facility for 2 months. I feel that it is a superior product to any other oxy/fuel combination on the market. It cuts even the thickest metals, faster and cleaner than anything I have seen.
Douglas Foster, Maintenance Supervisor of Major Utility in Florida















It’s rare to see a clean burning technology that is actually faster. MagneGas has accomplished this with MagneGas 2®.
Brian Linton, CEO of The Recycling Center of Florida















We tried the new version of MagneGas in May. I noticed a much faster preheat and cutting speed. I am looking forward to using this cutting fuel when it is released.

Technology
Summary of the MagneGas® Plasma Arc Flow Technology:
MagneGas Corporation® is a waste to energy company that converts liquid waste into a hydrogen based fuel. The Company owns the patents to this revolutionary technology which gasifies or sterilizes a number of liquid wastes and produces a gaseous fuel known as MagneGas®.  MagneGas® is a cost competitive and clean burning fuel that is essentially interchangeable with Natural Gas, Propane and Acetylene and it can be co-combusted with existing hydrocarbon fuels. MagneGas also has significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuel. The Magnegas® system occupies a small footprint and runs in a sealed, quiet and smoke free system.
 
MagneGas® Fuel Can be Used for:
Metal Cutting 
Transportation Fuel
Co-Combustion with Fossil Fuels
Heating
  
MagneGas® Recyclers Can Process:
Sewage / Sludge
Agricultural Waste
Leachates
Oil Based Liquids*
Industrial Waste Liquids*
*Certain Oil and Industrial Waste Liquids Require Further Testing, or Mixing with Water or other Liquids to Process.
 
The patented technology is based on flowing the target liquid waste through our patented submerged electric arc system between two electrodes. The arc decomposes the liquid molecules into atoms as it forms a plasma around the tips of the electrodes at about 10,000°F / 5,500 C. MagneGas® is created as the decomposed atoms rise to the surface and naturally forms into a gas.
MagneGas® is a cost competitive synthetic gas made from many liquid wastes such as sewage, sludge, animal manure, glycerin, used antifreeze, some oil based liquids and waste water. 

 
Sterilization Recycler
The post combustion exhaust from MagneGas® has been certified by an automotive laboratory accredited with the EPA to surpass all EPA requirements without a catalytic converter, and releases more oxygen when it burns than other fuels, making it dramatically cleaner than gasoline, diesel, and natural gas.
The MagneGas Recyclers have two operating modes:
GASIFICATION MODE is suitable to gasify target liquids for the maximum conversion of liquid to fuel and is most suitable for oily or hazardous wastes that require elimination. The waste is converted into MagneGas and carbon precipitates. In this mode the liquid is gasified.
STERILIZATION MODE is intended to sterilize target liquid wastes such as sewage, agricultural wastes, leachates, or any effluent where eliminating bacteriological activity is beneficial to convert the waste liquid into a fertilizer or Class A waste. This results in the production of MagneGas, and the same quantity of sterilized liquid, in this mode the liquid is retained but completely sterilized.
Certification of MagneGas Exhaust:
Magnegas® fuel was shown by EPA accredited laboratory analysis results to be suitable for use as automotive fuel without catalytic converters while surpassing all current EPA requirements for combustion exhaust emissions, as shown below.

The data was obtained using a Honda Civic adapted to run on natural gas and used with MagneGas without any change in timing and stochiometric ratio. The data on gasoline were obtained via the use of an identical Honda Civic running on gasoline. All data were obtained using the complex EPA routine simulating various city and mountain driving conditions.
The quality of MagneGas® exhaust is dramatically better than that of natural gas and gasoline. MagneGas® exhaust is much lower than EPA requirements; has about 50% less green gases (CO2) than gasoline exhaust; and contains 9% to 12% oxygen. Based on these measurements, it is postulated that MagneGas fuel can be used as an additive to fossil fuels to improve their exhaust characteristics.

Magnegas Corp. - (MM) (NASDAQ:MNGA)Historical Stock Chart
2 Months : From May 2017 to Jul 2017



TAMPA, Florida, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
MagneGas Corporation ("MagneGas" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:MNGA), a leading clean technology company in the renewable resources and environmental solutions industries, announced today that the company has expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of industrial tools to better meet growing client demand.  
Since 2010, MagneGas has been successful in penetrating the wholesale industrial gas industry through the introduction of the MagneGas clean technology product for the legacy acetylene market. MagneGas's acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary ESSI in November 2014, which is now part of the MagneGas Welding Supply division. This critical acquisition brought a deep customer base that quickly validated the MagneGas2® product as a strong competitive alternative to acetylene for metal cutting and fabrication.  
ESSI also brought an immediate diversification of revenue, providing revenue growth opportunities in non-proprietary industrial gases and traditional welding supplies. MagneGas has since used the MagneGas2® product as a key wedge product to establish relationships with leading industrial, manufacturing, construction, demolition and fabrication companies across the southeastern US markets.  
Many of MagneGas's largest clients have inquired about the company's ability to deliver a wider array of products in the industrial tool category. The company recognized this as a significant low-risk growth opportunity that is highly complementary to the company's current product offering. As a result, the company chose to add a highly experienced sales executive from a leading competitor this week. This executive brings a deep client relationship base with some of the largest companies in the construction, manufacturing, demolition, refurbishment, utilities and heavy industries across the southeastern US. Furthermore, this executive is expected to quickly transition approximately $1,000,000 in existing annual client revenues to MagneGas over the coming months.  
"We are very pleased to expand our sales team beyond our current product knowledge base," commented Ermanno Santilli, CEO of MagneGas. "We are excited to add these clients to our existing business model, and equally importantly, we look forward to bringing these new product offerings to our existing customer base. We see strong cross-sales synergies across the entire client base, as many of our current clients have a strong demand for our new products. We also see the ability to leverage our newly acquired customer relationships to springboard organically into new markets across the southeast and Sun Belt states. We are hopeful this will translate into accelerated revenue growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond."
"MagneGas is increasingly focused on driving immediate revenue growth by adding experienced sales executives with deep client relationships. We executed this same model in Sarasota, FL, and Huntington, IN. This is a process we look to replicate many times going forward," stated Scott Mahoney, CFO of MagneGas. "This approach provides an accelerated ability to leverage our sales team and our existing customer base to drive more profitable, cash-flow efficient growth. We are aggressively improving our core sales platform to maximize organic growth, and prepare for our desired expansion via acquisition in the coming quarters. We believe this approach will maximize the near term value of our disruptive technology to generate lasting shareholder value."

MagneGas Expands Product Offering
MagneGas Adds Industrial Tool Products and Senior Sales Executive To Enhance Client Relationships


























TAMPA, Florida, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --
TAMPA, Florida, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --


                                        








MagneGas Corporation ("MagneGas" or the "Company")                 

/quotes/zigman/90906483/composite MNGA

, a leading clean technology company in the renewable resources and environmental solutions industries, announced today that the company has expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of industrial tools to better meet growing client demand.  


                                        








Since 2010, MagneGas has been successful in penetrating the wholesale industrial gas industry through the introduction of the MagneGas clean technology product for the legacy acetylene market. MagneGas's acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary ESSI in November 2014, which is now part of the MagneGas Welding Supply division. This critical acquisition brought a deep customer base that quickly validated the MagneGas2® product as a strong competitive alternative to acetylene for metal cutting and fabrication.  


                                        








ESSI also brought an immediate diversification of revenue, providing revenue growth opportunities in non-proprietary industrial gases and traditional welding supplies. MagneGas has since used the MagneGas2® product as a key wedge product to establish relationships with leading industrial, manufacturing, construction, demolition and fabrication companies across the southeastern US markets.  


                                        








Many of MagneGas's largest clients have inquired about the company's ability to deliver a wider array of products in the industrial tool category. The company recognized this as a significant low-risk growth opportunity that is highly complementary to the company's current product offering. As a result, the company chose to add a highly experienced sales executive from a leading competitor this week. This executive brings a deep client relationship base with some of the largest companies in the construction, manufacturing, demolition, refurbishment, utilities and heavy industries across the southeastern US. Furthermore, this executive is expected to quickly transition approximately $1,000,000 in existing annual client revenues to MagneGas over the coming months.  


                                        








"We are very pleased to expand our sales team beyond our current product knowledge base," commented Ermanno Santilli, CEO of MagneGas. "We are excited to add these clients to our existing business model, and equally importantly, we look forward to bringing these new product offerings to our existing customer base. We see strong cross-sales synergies across the entire client base, as many of our current clients have a strong demand for our new products. We also see the ability to leverage our newly acquired customer relationships to springboard organically into new markets across the southeast and Sun Belt states. We are hopeful this will translate into accelerated revenue growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond."


                                        








"MagneGas is increasingly focused on driving immediate revenue growth by adding experienced sales executives with deep client relationships. We executed this same model in Sarasota, FL, and Huntington, IN. This is a process we look to replicate many times going forward," stated Scott Mahoney, CFO of MagneGas. "This approach provides an accelerated ability to leverage our sales team and our existing customer base to drive more profitable, cash-flow efficient growth. We are aggressively improving our core sales platform to maximize organic growth, and prepare for our desired expansion via acquisition in the coming quarters. We believe this approach will maximize the near term value of our disruptive technology to generate lasting shareholder value."  


                                        








About MagneGas Corporation


                                        








MagneGas® Corporation (MNGA) owns a patented process that converts various renewables and liquid wastes into MagneGas fuels. These fuels can be used as an alternative to natural gas or for metal cutting. The Company's testing has shown that its metal cutting fuel "MagneGas2®" is faster, cleaner and more productive than other alternatives on the market. It is also cost effective and safe to use with little changeover costs. The Company currently sells MagneGas2® into the metal working market as a replacement to acetylene.


                                        








The Company also sells equipment for the sterilization of bio-contaminated liquid waste for various industrial and agricultural markets. In addition, the Company is developing a variety of ancillary uses for MagneGas® fuels utilizing its high flame temperature for co-combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and other advanced applications. For more information on MagneGas®, please visit the Company's website at         http://www.MagneGas.com
.


                                        








The Company distributes MagneGas2® through Independent Distributors in the U.S. and through its wholly owned subsidiary MagneGas Welding Supply, LLC and its distributor, Equipment Sales and Services, Inc. ("ESSI"). ESSI has four locations in Florida and distributes MagneGas2®, industrial gases and welding supplies. For more information on ESSI, please visit the company's website at         http://www.weldingsupplytampa.com

MagneGas's acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary ESSI in November 2014, which is now part of the MagneGas Welding Supply division. This critical acquisition brought a deep customer base that quickly validated the MagneGas2® product as a strong competitive alternative to acetylene for metal cutting and fabrication.  ESSI also brought an immediate diversification of revenue, providing revenue growth opportunities in non-proprietary industrial gases and traditional welding supplies. MagneGas has since used the MagneGas2® product as a key wedge product to establish relationships with leading industrial, manufacturing, construction, demolition and fabrication companies across the southeastern US markets.  Many of MagneGas's largest clients have inquired about the company's ability to deliver a wider array of products in the industrial tool category. The company recognized this as a significant low-risk growth opportunity that is highly complementary to the company's current product offering. As a result, the company chose to add a highly experienced sales executive from a leading competitor this week. This executive brings a deep client relationship base with some of the largest companies in the construction, manufacturing, demolition, refurbishment, utilities and heavy industries across the southeastern US. Furthermore, this executive is expected to quickly transition approximately $1,000,000 in existing annual client revenues to MagneGas over the coming months.  "We are very pleased to expand our sales team beyond our current product knowledge base," commented Ermanno Santilli, CEO of MagneGas. "We are excited to add these clients to our existing business model, and equally importantly, we look forward to bringing these new product offerings to our existing customer base. We see strong cross-sales synergies across the entire client base, as many of our current clients have a strong demand for our new products. We also see the ability to leverage our newly acquired customer relationships to springboard organically into new markets across the southeast and Sun Belt states. We are hopeful this will translate into accelerated revenue growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond.""MagneGas is increasingly focused on driving immediate revenue growth by adding experienced sales executives with deep client relationships. We executed this same model in Sarasota, FL, and Huntington, IN. This is a process we look to replicate many times going forward," stated Scott Mahoney, CFO of MagneGas. "This approach provides an accelerated ability to leverage our sales team and our existing customer base to drive more profitable, cash-flow efficient growth. We are aggressively improving our core sales platform to maximize organic growth, and prepare for our desired expansion via acquisition in the coming quarters. We believe this approach will maximize the near term value of our disruptive technology to generate lasting shareholder value."  About MagneGas CorporationMagneGas® Corporation (MNGA) owns a patented process that converts various renewables and liquid wastes into MagneGas fuels. These fuels can be used as an alternative to natural gas or for metal cutting. The Company's testing has shown that its metal cutting fuel "MagneGas2®" is faster, cleaner and more productive than other alternatives on the market. It is also cost effective and safe to use with little changeover costs. The Company currently sells MagneGas2® into the metal working market as a replacement to acetylene.The Company also sells equipment for the sterilization of bio-contaminated liquid waste for various industrial and agricultural markets. In addition, the Company is developing a variety of ancillary uses for MagneGas® fuels utilizing its high flame temperature for co-combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and other advanced applications. For more information on MagneGas®, please visit the Company's website at http://www.MagneGas.com.Read MoreThe Company distributes MagneGas2® through Independent Distributors in the U.S. and through its wholly owned subsidiary MagneGas Welding Supply, LLC and its distributor, Equipment Sales and Services, Inc. ("ESSI"). ESSI has four locations in Florida and distributes MagneGas2®, industrial gases and welding supplies. For more information on ESSI, please visit the company's website at http://www.weldingsupplytampa.com.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined within Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

MagneGas Expands Product Offering









PR Newswire




May 31, 2017 8:52 AM EDT













 


















































  TAMPA, Florida, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MagneGas Corporation ("MagneGas" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:MNGA), a leading clean technology company in the renewable resources and environmental solutions industries, announced today that the company has expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of industrial tools to better meet growing client demand.   Since 2010, MagneGas has been successful in penetrating the wholesale industrial gas industry through the introduction of the MagneGas clean technology product for the legacy acetylene market. MagneGas's acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary ESSI in November 2014, which is now part of the MagneGas Welding Supply division. This critical acquisition brought a deep customer base that quickly validated the MagneGas2® product as a strong competitive alternative to acetylene for metal cutting and fabrication.   ESSI also brought an immediate diversification of revenue, providing revenue growth opportunities in non-proprietary industrial gases and traditional welding supplies. MagneGas has since used the MagneGas2® product as a key wedge product to establish relationships with leading industrial, manufacturing, construction, demolition and fabrication companies across the southeastern US markets.   Many of MagneGas's largest clients have inquired about the company's ability to deliver a wider array of products in the industrial tool category. The company recognized this as a significant low-risk growth opportunity that is highly complementary to the company's current product offering. As a result, the company chose to add a highly experienced sales executive from a leading competitor this week. This executive brings a deep client relationship base with some of the largest companies in the construction, manufacturing, demolition, refurbishment, utilities and heavy industries across the southeastern US. Furthermore, this executive is expected to quickly transition approximately $1,000,000 in existing annual client revenues to MagneGas over the coming months.   "We are very pleased to expand our sales team beyond our current product knowledge base," commented Ermanno Santilli, CEO of MagneGas. "We are excited to add these clients to our existing business model, and equally importantly, we look forward to bringing these new product offerings to our existing customer base. We see strong cross-sales synergies across the entire client base, as many of our current clients have a strong demand for our new products. We also see the ability to leverage our newly acquired customer relationships to springboard organically into new markets across the southeast and Sun Belt states. We are hopeful this will translate into accelerated revenue growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond." "MagneGas is increasingly focused on driving immediate revenue growth by adding experienced sales executives with deep client relationships. We executed this same model in Sarasota, FL, and Huntington, IN. This is a process we look to replicate many times going forward," stated Scott Mahoney, CFO of MagneGas. "This approach provides an accelerated ability to leverage our sales team and our existing customer base to drive more profitable, cash-flow efficient growth. We are aggressively improving our core sales platform to maximize organic growth, and prepare for our desired expansion via acquisition in the coming quarters. We believe this approach will maximize the near term value of our disruptive technology to generate lasting shareholder value."   About MagneGas Corporation
