History

First Sentry Bank, a West Virginia state chartered bank, commenced operations on October 23, 1996 after raising $6 million in capital from a private stock offering, and spent its first 20 months operating from a small renovated restaurant building.
The Bank moved into its main office facility on June 8, 1998. This three-story facility, which was built adjacent to the former restaurant building on the corner of Eighth Street and Ninth Avenue, is ideally located for residents of the South Side and Southeast Hills (of Huntington). It has five drive-thru lanes (including ATM), safe deposit boxes, and is well suited to provide the foundation from which the Bank continues to grow and prosper.
The bank opened its Barboursville office in July 2004 and with the acquisition of Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. in 2009 operates two additional facilities as well - full-service offices located in east Huntington on Route 60 East and in Lincoln County, West Virginia.
In late 2016, the bank grew the operations again with the acquisition of Rock Branch Bank and now operates another full-service banking office in Nitro, West Virginia.
First Sentry Bank has been recognized for several years by American Banker Magazine as one of the Top 200 Community Banks in America.  Additionally, the bank maintains a 5-star rating, the highest possible rating by Bauer Financial, the nations leading independent bank rating firm. 
First Sentry Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Sentry Bancshares, Inc., which is headquartered in Huntington, West Virginia. First Sentry Bancshares, Inc. has roughly 750 shareholders.
