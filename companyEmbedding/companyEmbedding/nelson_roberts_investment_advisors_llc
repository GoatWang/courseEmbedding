What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

Portfolio design
Discretionary portfolio management
Ongoing investment advice



Cash management

Planning

Business succession
Charitable giving

Wealth transfers

What is my preferred communication style?
You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?

Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Premium Bonds - Nelson Roberts

Premium Bonds






 
		





						Asset Management, Fixed Income
November 16, 2016





Premium Bonds 

Many bond investors are used to the idea of buying a bond at par value (price = $100) and receiving par value back at maturity. The idea of paying a premium, or paying more for a bond than it is worth at maturity, may seem like a bad idea. In fact, premium bonds can be better investments than non-premium bonds in a raising interest rate environment. Premium bonds return higher cash flow to the buyer which shortens the bonds’ duration and makes them less sensitive to interest rate changes.
What is a premium bond?
A premium bond is a bond trading above its par value (e.g. price is more than $100). A bond will trade above its par value when its coupon is higher than current interest rates. If prevailing interest rates are near 3% and a bond has a 5% coupon then buyers will pay a higher price to receive the larger coupon rate. The coupon rate is the amount of interest paid per year to a bondholder. While the coupon on most bonds is fixed, the market price of a security changes based on market conditions. The value of a bond depends on market interest rates, credit quality, coupon rate and maturity date of the bond. While economic and market-driven events impact a bond’s value, the expectation of change in interest rates typically has the strongest influence on bond prices. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise and when interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Which is the preferred bond to own in a raising interest rate environment?
At first glance, the answer may seem simple — buy the discount bond at $95 and benefit as the price rises to $100 at maturity. Alternatively, paying $110 for a bond that is going to mature at $100 seems to make no sense. But the difference in price is made up for by the higher coupon in the case of the premium bond, and the lower coupon in the case of the discount bond. In other words, the bond trading at a premium will offer higher income payments than the bond trading at a discount, which makes up for the difference in price.
Advantages of buying bonds at a premium:
• Premium bonds have a higher coupon, and therefore return more income to the investor
• Premium bonds are typically less sensitive to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates than similar discount bonds
Disadvantage of buying bonds at a premium:
• Premium bonds require a larger capital commitment up front
A bond’s investment return cannot be judged on price alone. Premium bonds offer a fairly straightforward trade-off: you pay more up front in exchange for larger interest payments. The higher cash flows of the premium bond accelerate the return on your investment. If interest rates are rising, the accelerated return of investment allows for cash to be reinvested at higher rates.

What is a Fiduciary?

What is a Fiduciary? 

Recently, President Trump announced plans to undo the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule. This was a rule intended to protect investors’ retirement funds by holding advisors to a “fiduciary standard,” meaning that the advisor’s actions must be in the best interest of the client.
Currently, advisors not registered with the SEC may dispense financial advice that is only held to a “suitability” standard. Often, these advisors are compensated for the advice they provide by earning commissions on the assets they sell to their clients. This is currently allowed, as long as they can deem the products “suitable” in some way, even if the investments are not exclusively in the clients’ best interest.
Imagine a car salesman selling an expensive 2-seat sports car to a family of 5. The salesman, motivated by the high commission, justifies the sports car as “suitable” because it is technically a mode of transportation. A more optimal solution for the family might be a lower-priced minivan, but this would earn the salesman a lower commission. Acting only on a “suitability” standard, the salesman can sell the family the sports car because he does not need to act in the best interest of the family.
Opponents of the Fiduciary Rule argue it would limit investor’s choice of advisor. We think it would be crazy to choose an investor that does not act in their best. Too often, we see prospective clients’ portfolios jam-packed with “suitable” yet inappropriate investment products that command high commissions for the selling broker. While the fate of the Fiduciary rule is unclear, we believe that it would be a positive development for investor welfare.
At Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors, we have always held ourselves to a fiduciary standard and not just for retirement accounts. We do not sell products or collect commissions. Our business model has always been to act in clients’ best interest.

Investors trust independent advisors with over $4 trillion of their money.
That’s some serious trust.










Investors trust independent advisors with over $4 trillion of their money.
That’s some serious trust.


Independent advisors are accountable.


Independent advisors are here to serve, not sell.


Independent Registered Investment Advisors are professionals held to a fiduciary standard.


Independent advisor firms are one of the fastest-growing areas within the financial services industry.


Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products.


Independent advisors focus on building deep, lasting relationships with clients.



































What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

Portfolio design
Discretionary portfolio management
Ongoing investment advice



Cash management

Retirement income



Planning

Retirement
Education funding
Business succession
Charitable giving
Personal and business lending
Wealth transfers

What is my preferred communication style?
You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?

Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.
