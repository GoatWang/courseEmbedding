Board of Directors
Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.
5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 1600
Minneapolis, MN  55416
Attn:  Sally Smith




Dear Members of the Board:


As you know, on August 22nd Marcato submitted a standard and routine request for shareholder list materials so that we may communicate with our fellow shareholders of Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. (the “Company or “BWW”).  Unfortunately, the Company has still not complied with its obligations under Minnesota law, as the vast majority of the requested information – and virtually all useful requested information – remains outstanding.  We are hopeful that management will agree to provide the remaining information promptly and without any further waste of Company resources.


We are troubled by the lengths to which management has gone in an apparent attempt to thwart our communications with other shareholders and have no doubt that our fellow shareholders will find management’s behavior as disconcerting as we do.  We were further troubled to hear of your decision on October 6th to appoint three new directors to the Company’s board, a decision made unilaterally and without consultation with the Company’s shareholders.  These new appointments were clearly intended to create the false impression of meaningful change, but without actual engagement in constructive dialogue with shareholders.  These actions are an unfortunate continuation of the Company’s pattern of entrenchment, obfuscation and poor decision making.  Accordingly, we are writing this letter to alert you and our fellow shareholders of the Company’s obstructionist behavior in the hope that you will instruct management to immediately put an end to it.


It has now been more than seven weeks since Marcato—a 5.2% stakeholder in BWW—requested a limited amount of information for the purpose of communicating with fellow shareholders.  As I’m sure you know, Marcato has an unassailable right under Minn. Stat. § 302A.461 to receive this information.  Other public companies routinely provide such information to shareholders without question or delay when presented with similar requests.  This is in fact the very same information that BWW is already using itself—we are merely seeking to have a “level playing field” with the Company. It should not take nearly two months to produce.


The Company initially refused to acknowledge that Marcato owned any BWW shares.  Specifically, Company counsel stated that the Schedule 13D which we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 17, 2016, a copy of which was enclosed with our request, was “insufficient to demonstrate that any particular entity was a shareholder of







BWW as of [August 22, 2016].”  Company counsel insisted that we provide a brokerage account statement evidencing Marcato’s ownership.  When asked to explain, our attorneys were told by your counsel that Marcato “could have sold all of its shares” since the 13D filing.  To put it another way: management appears to have envisioned a scenario in which Marcato submitted a shareholder list request after it sold all of its BWW holdings, without disclosing the sale in a subsequent 13D amendment.  It’s a scenario that defies logic.  Company counsel then conditioned providing any information on Marcato entering into an onerous confidentiality agreement that went well beyond what was required by law.  Surely, management must have understood that providing a draft agreement with such terms served no purpose other than to further delay our communications with other shareholders.


Nevertheless, we reached out in good faith with a draft confidentiality agreement reflecting an accommodating approach.  We also provided the account statement, as requested.  In return, Company counsel asserted that Marcato Capital Management LP (“Marcato Capital”) was not a proper party to the shareholder list request “[g]iven that the applicable statute requires the shareholder to own stock as of the dated [sic] of a demand.”  We were surprised by this response, given that Minn. Stat. § 302A.461 explicitly states that a “beneficial owner” has an “absolute right” to demand shareholder list materials and that Marcato Capital was clearly a beneficial owner.  Your counsel then demanded that Marcato Capital provide copies of its confidential investment advisory agreements to prove that it was a beneficial owner of common stock.


After multiple rounds of back and forth with counsel, management backed off its unsupported demands and conceded that we were shareholders and entitled to receive materials.  We were optimistic we were putting this episode behind us.  Unfortunately, when the materials we were promised finally arrived by email, the information we were given was incomplete, outdated and virtually useless.  These materials included:







·


Transfer agent-level shareholder lists of the holders of record of the Company’s common stock dated as of September 13, 2016 and March 17, 2016.  These lists did not provide any information regarding the identities or holdings of the actual beneficial owners of the common shares – information necessary to communicate with them and which is not only customarily provided but legally required to be provided; and
 








·


A list of holders of Company shares held through employee benefit plans, dated March 14, 2016.  This list is over six-months old and only provides information with respect to approximately 1% of the Company’s outstanding shares.
 





In other words, management chose to disclose only the holders known to the Company’s transfer agent.  You undoubtedly are aware that, as with every other public company, virtually all BWW shareholders hold their shares in “street name” through accounts with banks, brokers and other financial intermediaries.  The distinction between the two is critical and widely understood.  The information we were provided contains no relevant or useful information about the actual shareholder base.  That the Company would respond to our request in such a perfunctory manner is deeply disappointing.









It is clear that, in providing this information, management’s intent was to inhibit or delay our communications with other shareholders.  In this regard, it does not appear to be a mere coincidence that the information that management is refusing to provide us is also that which would facilitate such communications.  In particular, the Company’s response included neither a list of Non Objecting Beneficial Owners (“NOBO”) nor any information obtained from the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).  This is information that is easy to generate on a rolling basis as we have requested.  It’s not much harder than pushing a button.  And doing so would cost the Company nothing as we have committed to cover the expense.


If management’s true intent was to allow Marcato to communicate with other BWW shareholders, it would have provided all of the information requested in our August 22nd letter, including:







·


Contact information that was omitted in the Company’s response (e.g., telephone numbers) with respect to each record holder and employee plan (a “Plan”) participant;
 








·


Dates on which each record holder became a holder of record of shares;
 








·


Name, business address and telephone number of the Plan’s trustee or administrator;
 








·


Detailed explanation of the voting treatment of (A) shares of Company stock (“Stock”) for which a trustee or administrator receives instructions from Plan participants and (B) shares of Stock for which either the trustee or administrator does not receive instructions or shares of Stock which are outstanding in any such Plan but are unallocated to any participant;
 








·


Complete record or list of the holders of Stock and respondent banks (and their email addresses) who have elected to receive electronic copies of proxy materials with respect to meetings of stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14a-16(j)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”);
 








·


All information in possession or control of the Company or any of its transfer agents, registrars or proxy solicitors, or which can reasonably be obtained from DTC, brokers, dealers, banks, clearing agencies, voting trustees or their respective nominee, concerning the names, addresses, telephone numbers and number of shares of Stock held by the participating brokers and banks named in the individual nominee names of Cede & Co., specifically with respect to Cede & Co., the daily DTC Security Position Reports, or other similar depositories or nominees, including respondent bank lists, all omnibus proxies and related respondent bank proxies and listings issued pursuant to Rule 14b-2 under the Exchange Act;
 








·


All information in or that comes into the Company’s or its transfer agents’, registrars’ or proxy solicitors’ possession or control, or that can reasonably be obtained from brokers, dealers, banks, clearing agencies, voting trustees or their respective nominee (including











Broadridge Financial Services and Mediant Communications), relating to the names, addresses, and number of shares of the beneficial owners of Stock pursuant to Rule 14b-1(c) or Rule 14b-2(c) under the Exchange Act, including a NOBO list; and
 




·


Updates to all of the information described above on a rolling basis going forward.







These materials should be provided to us promptly.  We have no desire to engage in litigation as a means to resolve the issues outlined in this letter.  However, we are quickly approaching a point where management’s obstinate resistance will leave us with no other choice, and your recent actions have only exacerbated our concerns that shareholders’ interests are not being served by the board as currently composed.  Accordingly, we reserve all rights and remedies.


We look forward to hearing from you.




Sincerely,





Mick McGuire

	August 17, 2016








	James Damian


	Chairman, Board of Directors


	Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.


	5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 1600


	Minneapolis, MN  55416





	James,





	As you know, investment funds managed by Marcato Capital Management LP (“Marcato”) currently own securities representing beneficial ownership of 5.2% of the shares outstanding of Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. (the “Company”).  It has been two months since we first sat down with management to begin a private dialogue about opportunities to enhance shareholder value.  Given the Company’s lackluster analyst day presentation and observable discontent among shareholders and research analysts, we have determined that it is appropriate at this point to share our perspectives with the investment community.  Along with this letter, we are filing the analysis that we shared with management at our first meeting in June and hope that research analysts as well as current and prospective shareholders will consider this information and express their views on the subject matter.





	I should emphasize that we are exceedingly optimistic about the future of Buffalo Wild Wings.  In the crowded and competitive restaurant universe, Buffalo Wild Wings offers an experience that is superior to and highly differentiated from those offered at any of the sports-themed competitors in its markets.  The benefits of its national scale, from marketing to purchasing to best practices, will continue to position Buffalo Wild Wings as the preferred destination to experience televised sports outside of the home.  In fact, we think the Company’s estimated addressable market of 1,700 units (compared to 1,220 expected by year-end 2016) in the United States and Canada may be far too low and deserves to be revisited.





	We also believe, however, that Buffalo Wild Wings must make substantial changes to its business practices if it hopes to reach its full potential both as a company and in terms of shareholder value.  Our initial conversations with management focused on the Company’s capital allocation decisions, which we discuss below and detail in our attached analysis.  Following months of engagement with the Company, we have come to appreciate that suboptimal capital allocation behavior is symptomatic of a larger organizational deficiency: a tendency to favor gut feel and thematic proclamations without


	 








	tangible evidence or appropriate analytical support.  The management team of Buffalo Wild Wings communicates its strategic and financial rationale to the investment community with inveterate avoidance of specificity.  The chronic absence of detail around even the most basic of metrics causes us to question whether the right questions are being asked and answered.





	We direct this concern not only toward management, but also toward the Board of Directors whose duty is to oversee, evaluate, and incentivize management in such a way as to ensure that the business is run in shareholders’ best interests.  We are committed to doing our part to help the business achieve its full potential.  We expect that the necessary changes will include the following:









	1)





	The introduction of fresh talent at both the Board and management levels

	.  The Company must improve its experience and sophistication in areas of restaurant operations, franchise system development, corporate finance, and capital markets.  We are confident that the Board would benefit from adding independent directors with operating experience in the restaurant industry, in particular with a franchised restaurant concept.  We note that no current director has direct restaurant operating experience outside of the CEO.  We would also stress that any changes to the Board should only be made after consultation with interested shareholders, and we would view any unilateral action to change the composition of the Board as a hostile act of entrenchment.













	2)





	A greater focus on operational excellence within Buffalo Wild Wings’ core business.

	  The Company must improve in key operational areas such as food quality, price/value perception, speed of service, technology implementation, food cost optimization, and labor engineering – all areas where it is substantially underperforming its potential, and, that if improved, can drastically help restore the Company’s customer value proposition. Efforts to drive “growth” primarily through new unit openings and franchisee acquisitions currently take unwarranted precedence over maximizing same-store sales and restaurant-level margin opportunities at core Buffalo Wild Wings.  Over the long-term, neither system growth nor franchisee acquisitions will be able to compensate for a decline in the profitability of the core concept.













	3)





	Cessation of “emerging brands” growth plans.

	  Buffalo Wild Wings’ continued success is not an inevitability; as such, we believe the Company should remain singularly focused on its largest earnings driver rather than placing wild bets, however small, on hit-or-miss “growth drivers”— particularly those in the highly competitive, non-core, fast casual space.  Experiments with new restaurant concepts are distracting management from advancing Buffalo Wild Wings’ core brand.  At this point in time, any corporate resources, be they personnel, capital, or attention, would be better allocated to addressing the operational improvement opportunities at core Buffalo Wild Wings.













	4)





	A profound increase in urgency, follow-through, and accountability.

	  A review of past years’ earnings reports reveals a number of Company “priorities” that have since dragged on without meaningful progress, the most obvious example being the bungled roll out of table-side order and pay functionality.  The commentary in the current period regarding the near-term goals






	 


	 




	2
















	 




	for these programs is the same that it was two and three years ago despite the Company having missed its initial execution objectives.  Even now, management is content to highlight the opportunity while very little tangible progress has been achieved.  This issue is representative of a much larger issue of management’s persistent failure to execute and the Board’s failure to hold management accountable.






	 







	5)





	An audit of managerial decision tools and a reconciliation of business outcomes as compared to forecasts. 

	Despite frequent assurance from management of the use of DCF- and IRR-based forecasts to approve investments such as remodel campaigns, new unit openings, or acquisitions, our experience with retail and restaurant businesses has taught us that those processes can be highly flawed. We take seriously the tendencies of development staff to reverse-engineer projections to achieve a stated hurdle rate or highlight data with a selection bias to support past decisions.  The Board must review past capital investments to ensure that outcomes compare favorably with the underwriting process.  We recommend starting with an assessment of the Company’s large franchisee acquisition in 2015, which based on all available data, has been an unmitigated disaster.  That such an obviously misguided decision could be made under the guise of rigorous analysis underscores the weaknesses in the Company’s capital allocation processes and need to commit to a disciplined capital allocation program.









	The list above speaks to functional changes that will improve business performance.  At a higher level, however, there is an intellectual divide that must also be addressed: there is a glaring deficiency of understanding at the Company in how capital deployment relates to shareholder value creation.  Yesterday’s announcement of a $300 million share repurchase authorization further highlights this point.





	Management self-identifies its objectives to be those of a “growth company” but does not appear to have a clear sense of what that exactly means or how (and if) achieving this poorly defined “growth” objective is best for shareholders.  Growth in revenue or earnings simply cannot be evaluated without consideration for the capital deployed in the achievement.  This basic principle of corporate finance is tragically underappreciated by the current management team.





	Instead, management celebrates consolidated revenue growth without discriminating between revenue derived from growth in royalties from franchisee unit development, same-store sales growth (itself a product of tension between higher price and declining traffic), new company-operated unit growth, and the purchase of units from franchisees.  Each of these revenue streams has a radically different margin profile and comes at a radically different capital cost (franchise royalties in particular come at no cost whatsoever). 


	Most importantly, the income derived from each of these different revenue streams receives a radically different value in the market due to its unique degree of capital intensity and predictability.  Management and the Board should be solely focused on growing market value per share, determining which types of revenue growth will best deliver that outcome.









	3








	Additionally, management frequently highlights growth in average unit volumes, but fails to acknowledge that this growth has been accompanied by an increase in per unit construction and pre-opening costs from $840K in 2003 to $2.6M in 2015, leading to a significant decline in the returns on invested capital.  We perceive that the pursuit of higher average unit volumes (management’s barometer for “growth”) has led the Company to deploy ever-greater amounts of capital into larger units tailored to more populous, but also more competitive, and more expensive markets.  Similarly, remodel costs for the current Stadia program are increasing over prior remodel budgets, and the Company has not articulated the basic return on investment methodology that illustrates why the new remodels are attractive, why the current remodel cost is appropriate, or if similar outcomes could be achieved at a lower cost.  Might shareholders and customers alike be better off if capital were instead invested into smaller-format units that, at the expense of lower AUV’s, could profitably succeed in smaller, less competitive markets with lower construction and operating costs, producing higher returns on capital?





	Management appears to believe that realizing its identity as a “growth” company means delivering EPS growth of 15% or greater.  However, even this statement is made without any design as to how that will be achieved.  Beneath the headline, there is no calculus as to how same-store sales, operating margin expansion, franchise vs. company unit growth, franchisee acquisitions, and share repurchases will combine to produce such a result.  Just how this earnings goal is achieved, and in particular how much capital is required to achieve it, will dictate the multiple of EPS at which the shares will trade. 


	This is the vital and missing link between earnings creation and shareholder value creation.


	  The apparent lack of sensitivity to this connection is the primary impediment to shareholders earning an attractive return on their investment in the future.





	Unfortunately for shareholders, the easiest growth to come by has been the kind that is BOUGHT, requiring the most capital and offering the lowest returns.  As same-store sales have decelerated and the law of large numbers has made it difficult for new unit additions to sustain historical revenue growth rates, management has turned to buying in franchisees in its pursuit of “growth.”  The large franchisee acquisitions in 2015 were telegraphed to investors, under the pretense of being “opportunistic,” as helping the Company achieve its goal of growing sales and net income.  At the same time, the Company did not offer any concrete rationale for why this transaction would create more shareholder value than allowing the units instead to be sold to a third party buyer – an outcome that would have retained the existing high-value franchise royalty stream and avoided a major capital outlay at an excessive and unprecedented multiple, and moreover would have avoided the additional cost and distractions of transaction fees, remodel requirements, regional G&A investments, integration risks, and operational complexity.





	Despite the Company’s refusal to disclose key financial metrics of the transaction, it is clear to us that the acquisitions of 2015 were mistakes and would not be approved today if an appropriate methodology were employed.  This acquisitive behavior is almost certainly reinforced by an incentive compensation system, designed by the Board, that rewards (if not preconditions) management for maximizing absolute growth in revenue dollars, net income dollars, and store openings – all metrics that fail to acknowledge the capital required to achieve these outcomes and whether the returns on that capital investment are appropriate.  In contrast, most other high-performing restaurant companies emphasize metrics more explicitly tied to shareholder value, including operating income (not sales),




	4








	EPS (not net income), and ROIC and total shareholder return -- all of which are absent from management’s incentive compensation design.






	We are confident that Buffalo Wild Wings is in a strong position to compete and succeed in the future. However, we believe this opportunity will be squandered if our concerns highlighted here are not addressed with urgency.  We look forward to a vigorous discussion of these factors with the Board and management going forward.











	Sincerely,











	Mick McGuire

However, the most important tools in the kitchen are the cookware and bakeware that chefs and cooks use to create their culinary masterpieces. Look to Walmart for the right pieces in your home kitchen so that you can make an array of complete meals, late-night snacks and delicious baked goods for your family and friends, all at Every Day Low Prices. Cookware More than any other non-utensil you use in the kitchen, nothing gets more use than your pots and pans. Although there are sets that contain 8, 10, 12 or more pieces (including lids), there are usually two or three go-to pieces that you use for nearly every meal. These include a small or medium pot, large saut  pan or skillet and a Dutch oven. With just those three pieces, you can cook nearly everything you might consider preparing in the kitchen. If you have room, additional pieces of cookware make for nice additions, which is why the sets of cookware that you can buy make so much sense. If you have the room, a good set of cookware should contain two different-sized saucepans (with lids), two or three different-sized skillets, a deep saucier pan for deep frying and a Dutch oven or stock pot. Lids for these pans may be interchangeable as many of them are the same diameter as each other. The material that makes up the cookware is just as important as how many pieces you have.  Stainless steel is very versatile and reliable as it can take high heat, easily going from the stove to the oven, and cleans up somewhat easily, although it requires cooking with some form of fat, such as oil or butter, to prevent food from sticking. Nonstick pans are ideal for those who are concerned about cleanup, but some of these pans are not suitable for oven use, and you must only use wooden or silicone utensils with them to prevent damaging the nonstick coating. Tri-ply pans that have a copper core encased between two layers of stainless steel, known as clad, are ideal cookware as these heat food more evenly. Other options available include aluminum, ceramic, copper and hard-anodized. Other cookware items you may want to have on hand include cast-iron pans or carbon steel pans. These pans, after being seasoned, have a natural nonstick ability to them. Additional items to consider include:  Grill pan   ideal for those who cook meats like steak indoors and want to have grill marks on their food Double boiler   makes it possible to create delicate sauces like Hollandaise sauce or temper items like chocolate without burning them Large stock pot   makes it easy to boil long pasta or seafood like whole lobster Wok   useful for cooking over flame at high temperatures, such as when stir-frying vegetables and meat Pressure cooker   makes large cuts of meat in a shorter time as it uses steam and cooks under pressure, resulting in tender foods Roasting pan   ideal for use in the oven to make large roast or fowl like a turkey Bakeware Although they are often used for baking breads and sweets, bakeware items are used quite often for general cooking purposes as well. One of the most important items to have are sheet pans. Sheet pans are great for making baked goods like cookies, but they also work well when roasting vegetables and broiling cuts of meat. They're also very handy when you need to hold food items in a warm oven while you finish the rest of the meal. Working hand in hand with sheet pans are silicone mats, which provide nonstick ability to pans that would have to be heavily oiled otherwise. Cookie sheets are like sheet pans except that have no raised edges, allowing bakers to remove baked items more easily. There are many pans that can be part of the home bakeware arsenal. These include cake pans, which can be round, square or rectangular; springform pans, which are ideal for delicate baked goods like cheesecake; pie pans; loaf pans (for making bread or meat dishes like meatloaf); and a tube or Bundt pan. Many of these pans are metal, but there are also glass and silicone pans that serve the same purposes. Casserole dishes, especially one that is 13 inches by 9 inches, are ideal for making many things in the oven, such as casseroles, cakes and macaroni and cheese. Other bakeware items to consider, depending on what you like to make at home, include:  Pizza stone and pizza pans   for making homemade pizza Souffl  dishes and ramekins   for making egg-based dishes and custards Tart pan   for making pastries and quiches Muffin pans   for cupcakes and muffinsShow moreElectrode, Comp-138129728, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

We have many different dining room sets available, ideal for two people or six or more. The tables come in many shapes, such as round, square, oval and rectangular, in sizes that range from less than 30 inches long to more than 100 inches and heights that range from 15 inches or less to more than 31 inches. Match the style of your dining set to that of the rest of your home with contemporary, modern, rustic or transitional styles. You can also buy the table and chairs separately and mix and match them as you see fit. There are other pieces in matching styles you can add to your dining area as well.Barstools   These chairs with long legs are placed alongside kitchen counters, freestanding bars and pass-through windows for guests to sit at. Some just have a seat, while others have high backs, too.Pub tables   These are small tables that are round, square or other shapes and have long legs and usually two modest chairs that have slightly longer legs than dining chairs. These can also serve as bistro sets and breakfast tables.Sideboards and buffets   When you need additional serving space, such as for holiday meals, sideboards and buffets make it possible to keep dishes close to the dinner table. These are stationary cabinets that rest along a wall near the dining table. When not in use, they can serve as a place for candles, plants and knickknacks.China cabinets   These are tall, multi-shelf cabinets with decorative wood and glass doors that allow you to display fine china, crystal and family heirlooms in a safe, dust-free environment.Bakers' racks   Bakers' racks can either go in a kitchen or dining area, and are tall, narrow metal racks for placing pots, pans and other kitchen tools on. Some have hooks for hanging pots and pans, and all have two or three shelves for storage. Some also come with a wine bottle rack.Bars, bar cabinets and wine cabinets   Safely and discreetly store your alcohol and wine bottles behind a freestanding bar or bar/wine cabinet. These make alcohol, mixers, bar tools and glasses accessible when company drops by. Wine cabinets put your wine collection on display, allowing you to lay the bottles down to help preserve them.
