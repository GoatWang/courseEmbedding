Pure Cycle has water assets located in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. The majority of our water rights (which are our "Rangeview Water Assets" - located in the Denver metropolitan area) are being used or anticipated to be used to deliver wholesale water services to our customers, which are local government providers of water services to their end-use customers for primarily residential uses throughout the Front Range of Colorado.
Recycle - Reduce - Reuse
Pure Cycle Corporation is committed to thinking outside the box when it comes to designing and operating a sustainable and environmentally friendly water / wastewater system. Our dual distribution systems allow us to utilize our clean potable water for domestic water demands, collect, treat, store and return highly reclaimed water for outdoor irrigation use, greatly reducing the amount of water that is wasted by a traditional water systems.
We also have designed our systems to include the use of individual rain meters which will shut off irrigation systems in the event that natural precipitation exceeds specified amounts and we will utilize the latest technology for leak detection and automated meter relaying systems to reduce the number of traditional meter readers required to be driving and using precious fuel. We encourage the use of efficient appliances (showers, toilets, washing machines, etc) and anticipate offering an incentive program to our local government water service provider customers to encourage their customers to buy low flow products.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.87      Net Money Flow ($)  25,492    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
