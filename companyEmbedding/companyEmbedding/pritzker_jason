The Pritzker family is an American family engaged in entrepreneurship and philanthropy, and one of the wealthiest families in the United States of America, being near the top of Forbes magazine's "America's Richest Families" list since the magazine began listings in 1982.
The family is most well known for owning the Hyatt hotel chain, and the Marmon Group, a conglomerate of manufacturing and industrial service companies that has since been sold to Berkshire Hathaway.[1] Other holdings have included the Superior Bank of Chicago, which collapsed in 2001, the TransUnion credit bureau, and the Royal Caribbean cruise line.

Pritzker family

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Pritzker family is an American family engaged in entrepreneurship and philanthropy, and one of the wealthiest families in the United States of America, being near the top of Forbes magazine's "America's Richest Families" list since the magazine began listings in 1982.
The family is most well known for owning the Hyatt hotel chain, and the Marmon Group, a conglomerate of manufacturing and industrial service companies that has since been sold to Berkshire Hathaway.[1] Other holdings have included the Superior Bank of Chicago, which collapsed in 2001, the TransUnion credit bureau, and the Royal Caribbean cruise line.
The Pritzker family is of Jewish descent[2] and is known for its relationship to Chicago.[3]

Family business[edit]
In 1995, Jay Pritzker (cofounder of Hyatt) stepped down and Thomas Pritzker took control of the The Pritzker Organization.[3] When Jay died in 1999, the family split the business into 11 pieces worth $1.4 billion each, but had to settle a lawsuit from two family members who received $500 million each.[3]
In 2011, the dissolution had been completed and the cousins had gone their separate ways, with some pursuing business and others pursuing philanthropic or artistic ventures.[4]
