LAS VEGAS, Aug. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- On August 1, 2014, Jeffrey W. Shaw, President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Southwest Gas Corporation (NYSE:    SWX), informed the Board of Directors ("Board") that he will retire as the CEO effective March 1, 2015.  Mr. Shaw also stepped down as the Company's President on August 1, 2014.  Mr. Shaw's career at Southwest Gas has spanned 26 years, with over 10 years as CEO.

Mr. Hester, a 25-year employee of Southwest Gas, has served as Executive Vice President since 2013 and was responsible for administration, finance, gas resources, legal, marketing, and regulatory affairs.  He served as the Senior Vice President/Regulatory Affairs and Energy Resources from 2006 to 2013 and as Vice President/Regulatory Affairs and Systems Planning from 2003 to 2006.
