History[edit]




The headquarters of the National Bank of Canada is located in Tour de la Banque Nationale.






National Bank of Canada Office in Toronto.






National Bank of Canada in Richmond Hill


In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuade the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the Bank’s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the Board of Directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as Chairman of the bank.
The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with Banque d’Hochelaga assisted by the province's legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed "Banque Canadienne Nationale" (BCN) (English, "Canadian National Bank").
In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.
During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People’s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name" National Bank of Canada" in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.
In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country.[7] In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank's subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.
In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.[8]
In 2007, President and CEO Réal Raymond retires. He is succeeded by Louis Vachon, former President and COO.
In 2008, the Bank acquires four independent full-service brokerage firms, expanding its presence in Toronto and Winnipeg and reinforcing its leadership in the Quebec market. On May 4, 2009, National Bank celebrates its 150th anniversary.
In 2011, it acquires Wellington West Holdings Inc., one of the leading independent full service wealth management firms in Canada, and the year later, the full service investment advisory business of HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. The Bank also merges its Natcan asset management subsidiary with Fiera Capital Corporation, and acquires a strategic interest in the firm, making Fiera one of the largest independent portfolio managers in Canada.
During 2012, National Bank also plays a pivotal role, as part of a group of 12 major Canadian banks and pension funds, in the acquisition of TMX Group. In 2013, the bank announces the largest donation in its history: $10 million to Campus Montréal for the creation of the National Bank | HEC Montréal Institute for Entrepreneurship.
In November 2013, National Bank finalizes the acquisition of TD Waterhouse Institutional Services (TDWIS). This transaction marks another major milestone in the Canada-wide expansion of the Bank’s wealth management sector.

History[edit]




The headquarters of the National Bank of Canada is located in Tour de la Banque Nationale.






National Bank of Canada Office in Toronto.






National Bank of Canada in Richmond Hill


In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuade the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the Bank’s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the Board of Directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as Chairman of the bank.
The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with Banque d’Hochelaga assisted by the province's legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed "Banque Canadienne Nationale" (BCN) (English, "Canadian National Bank").
In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.
During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People’s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name" National Bank of Canada" in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.
In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country.[7] In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank's subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.
In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.[8]
In 2007, President and CEO Réal Raymond retires. He is succeeded by Louis Vachon, former President and COO.
In 2008, the Bank acquires four independent full-service brokerage firms, expanding its presence in Toronto and Winnipeg and reinforcing its leadership in the Quebec market. On May 4, 2009, National Bank celebrates its 150th anniversary.
In 2011, it acquires Wellington West Holdings Inc., one of the leading independent full service wealth management firms in Canada, and the year later, the full service investment advisory business of HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. The Bank also merges its Natcan asset management subsidiary with Fiera Capital Corporation, and acquires a strategic interest in the firm, making Fiera one of the largest independent portfolio managers in Canada.
During 2012, National Bank also plays a pivotal role, as part of a group of 12 major Canadian banks and pension funds, in the acquisition of TMX Group. In 2013, the bank announces the largest donation in its history: $10 million to Campus Montréal for the creation of the National Bank | HEC Montréal Institute for Entrepreneurship.
In November 2013, National Bank finalizes the acquisition of TD Waterhouse Institutional Services (TDWIS). This transaction marks another major milestone in the Canada-wide expansion of the Bank’s wealth management sector.

History[edit]




The headquarters of the National Bank of Canada is located in Tour de la Banque Nationale.

National Bank of Canada in Richmond Hill


In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuade the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the Bank’s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the Board of Directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as Chairman of the bank.
The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with Banque d’Hochelaga assisted by the province's legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed "Banque Canadienne Nationale" (BCN) (English, "Canadian National Bank").
In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.
During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People’s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name" National Bank of Canada" in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.
In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country.[7] In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank's subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.
In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.[8]
In 2007, President and CEO Réal Raymond retires. He is succeeded by Louis Vachon, former President and COO.
In 2008, the Bank acquires four independent full-service brokerage firms, expanding its presence in Toronto and Winnipeg and reinforcing its leadership in the Quebec market. On May 4, 2009, National Bank celebrates its 150th anniversary.
In 2011, it acquires Wellington West Holdings Inc., one of the leading independent full service wealth management firms in Canada, and the year later, the full service investment advisory business of HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. The Bank also merges its Natcan asset management subsidiary with Fiera Capital Corporation, and acquires a strategic interest in the firm, making Fiera one of the largest independent portfolio managers in Canada.
During 2012, National Bank also plays a pivotal role, as part of a group of 12 major Canadian banks and pension funds, in the acquisition of TMX Group. In 2013, the bank announces the largest donation in its history: $10 million to Campus Montréal for the creation of the National Bank | HEC Montréal Institute for Entrepreneurship.
In November 2013, National Bank finalizes the acquisition of TD Waterhouse Institutional Services (TDWIS). This transaction marks another major milestone in the Canada-wide expansion of the Bank’s wealth management sector.

The National Bank of Canada (French: Banque Nationale du Canada) is the sixth largest commercial bank in Canada. It is headquartered in Montreal, and has branches in most Canadian provinces and 2.4 million personal clients.[4] National Bank is the largest bank in Quebec, and the second largest financial institution in the province, after Desjardins. National Bank's Institution Number is 006 and its SWIFT code is BNDCCAMMINT.
As at July 31, 2016, National Bank had a network of 453 branches and 937 Automated Teller Machines in Canada.[5] It also had a number of representative offices, subsidiaries and partnerships in other countries, through which it serves Canadian and non-Canadian clients.
In 2011, National Bank was placed third in Bloomberg's list of "The World’s Strongest Banks".[6]
National Bank's business is concentrated in Quebec, and it is expanding on other provinces. For the year ending October 31, 2015, 62% of its total revenues were from Quebec, 32% from other provinces, and 6% from its international and unallocated operations.[1] Its total revenues for the year were allocated across business lines:

48% from personal banking,
36% from commercial banking,
12% from payment solutions, and

History[edit]




The headquarters of the National Bank of Canada is located in Tour de la Banque Nationale.






National Bank of Canada Office in Toronto.






National Bank of Canada in Richmond Hill


In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuade the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the Bank’s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the Board of Directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as Chairman of the bank.
The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with Banque d’Hochelaga assisted by the province's legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed "Banque Canadienne Nationale" (BCN) (English, "Canadian National Bank").
In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.
During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People’s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name" National Bank of Canada" in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.
In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country.[7] In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank's subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.
In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.[8]
In 2007, President and CEO Réal Raymond retires. He is succeeded by Louis Vachon, former President and COO.
In 2008, the Bank acquires four independent full-service brokerage firms, expanding its presence in Toronto and Winnipeg and reinforcing its leadership in the Quebec market. On May 4, 2009, National Bank celebrates its 150th anniversary.
In 2011, it acquires Wellington West Holdings Inc., one of the leading independent full service wealth management firms in Canada, and the year later, the full service investment advisory business of HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. The Bank also merges its Natcan asset management subsidiary with Fiera Capital Corporation, and acquires a strategic interest in the firm, making Fiera one of the largest independent portfolio managers in Canada.
During 2012, National Bank also plays a pivotal role, as part of a group of 12 major Canadian banks and pension funds, in the acquisition of TMX Group. In 2013, the bank announces the largest donation in its history: $10 million to Campus Montréal for the creation of the National Bank | HEC Montréal Institute for Entrepreneurship.
In November 2013, National Bank finalizes the acquisition of TD Waterhouse Institutional Services (TDWIS). This transaction marks another major milestone in the Canada-wide expansion of the Bank’s wealth management sector.

In 2011, National Bank was placed third in Bloomberg's list of "The World’s Strongest Banks".[6]

History[edit]




The headquarters of the National Bank of Canada is located in Tour de la Banque Nationale.






National Bank of Canada Office in Toronto.






National Bank of Canada in Richmond Hill


In 1859, francophone businessmen in Ontario and Quebec were keen to establish a bank under their local control, and persuade the provincial legislature to pass the act that created the Banque Nationale on May 4, 1859. Some members of the anglophone bourgeoisie participated in the Bank’s share capital, but francophones retained exclusive control and held all seats on the Board of Directors with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Assembly serving as Chairman of the bank.
The bank suffered losses during the banking crisis sparked by the financial panic of 1873 and panic of 1884 but managed to survive and continued to operate. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Banque Nationale again came under financial stress; this time a merger was arranged with Banque d’Hochelaga assisted by the province's legislature to strengthen the bank. The merged bank was renamed "Banque Canadienne Nationale" (BCN) (English, "Canadian National Bank").
In 1968, BCN, in conjunction with a number of other banks, launched Chargex, the first credit card to be issued by a Canadian bank.
During the 1970s, Quebec-based rival Provincial Bank of Canada expanded rapidly through a number of acquisitions. It merged with the People’s Bank in 1970, with the Toronto-based Unity Bank of Canada, and in 1979 it acquired Laurentide Financial Corporation of Vancouver. Provincial Bank and BCN continued to expand but continued to have a large part of their operations concentrated in Quebec. In November 1979, these two banks decided to merge under the new name" National Bank of Canada" in what was at the time one of the largest bank mergers.
Through the 1980s the bank continued to grow and expand its businesses through a number of acquisitions, including the brokerage firm Lévesque Beaubien and a year later Geoffrion Leclerc, which became known as Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion. In 1993, it sold its lease financing operations to GE Capital and acquired the assets of General Trust of Canada.
In 1994, it made a small step outside Canada when it opened two branches in the United States, one in Florida and one in California. In 1995 the bank opened a representative office in Cuba to assist Canadian clients doing business in the country.[7] In 1999 it concluded its purchase of First Marathon, a Toronto-based brokerage firm. First Marathon and the Bank's subsidiary Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. merged their operations to form National Bank Financial (NBF), its investment banking subsidiary. In 2002 it acquired US-based investment bank Putnam Lovell and merged the operations with its NBF subsidiary which started operating through offices in New York, Toronto, and London.
In March 2006, it sold its shareholder management services to Computershare.[8]
In 2007, President and CEO Réal Raymond retires. He is succeeded by Louis Vachon, former President and COO.
In 2008, the Bank acquires four independent full-service brokerage firms, expanding its presence in Toronto and Winnipeg and reinforcing its leadership in the Quebec market. On May 4, 2009, National Bank celebrates its 150th anniversary.
In 2011, it acquires Wellington West Holdings Inc., one of the leading independent full service wealth management firms in Canada, and the year later, the full service investment advisory business of HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. The Bank also merges its Natcan asset management subsidiary with Fiera Capital Corporation, and acquires a strategic interest in the firm, making Fiera one of the largest independent portfolio managers in Canada.
During 2012, National Bank also plays a pivotal role, as part of a group of 12 major Canadian banks and pension funds, in the acquisition of TMX Group. In 2013, the bank announces the largest donation in its history: $10 million to Campus Montréal for the creation of the National Bank | HEC Montréal Institute for Entrepreneurship.
In November 2013, National Bank finalizes the acquisition of TD Waterhouse Institutional Services (TDWIS). This transaction marks another major milestone in the Canada-wide expansion of the Bank’s wealth management sector.
