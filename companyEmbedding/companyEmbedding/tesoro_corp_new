About Tesoro


About Tesoro Corporation
Vision Statement
Every day we create a safer and cleaner future as efficient providers of reliable transportation fuel solutions.
Who We Are
For more than 45 years, Tesoro has been serving the fuel transportation needs of the western United States. We are a leading independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, committed to operating responsibly in the communities we serve. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, our operations extend across 18 states.
As crude oil sources, availability and costs shift, particularly in the United States, we aim to adapt to these market conditions in ways that benefit the long-term health of our business. We are expanding through strategic acquisition and organic growth, investing in capital projects and partnerships that will help lead to a successful future.
We are committed to delivering value to all of those invested in our success – the communities where we operate, our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
What We Do
Tesoro safely, efficiently and reliably operates an integrated network of strategic assets that create and sell refined petroleum products, from feedstock acquisition to wholesale, commercial and retail sales outlets.
At our refineries, Tesoro refines crude oil and other feedstocks into transportation fuels, such as conventional and CARB gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and other petroleum products, including heavy fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum coke, calcined coke and asphalt.
Our marine operations charter U.S.- and foreign-flagged tankers to optimize the transportation of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products within our refinery system.
Through our retail and marketing operations, Tesoro sells refined petroleum products via commercial, wholesale and retail channels. Commercial marketing trades in commercial and military jet fuel and heavy fuel products. Our wholesale program markets gasoline and diesel fuel to independent marketers, commercial end-users and high-volume retailers. Our network of retail stations sells gasoline and diesel fuels and convenience products directly to consumers under multiple well-known brands, including ARCO®, SuperAmerica®, Shell®, Exxon®, Mobil®, Conoco®, Tesoro®, USA Gasoline™ and Giant®.
Tesoro Corporation formed a master limited partnership, Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE: TLLP), which has a significant logistics presence in gathering, transporting, storing and distributing the crude and other feedstocks we refine.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link.

Company History

Our History
Tesoro was founded in 1968 as a company primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. In 1969, we began operating our first refinery near Kenai, Alaska, which today remains an important part of our expanding operations.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro began a series of refinery, logistics and retail acquisitions that have boosted the company’s capacity output, improved the efficiency of our operations, increased our retail presence and positioned us for future expansion in key growth markets. During this time, we also exited the exploration and production business.

1968: Tesoro Corporation founded
1969: Began operating first refinery in Kenai, Alaska
1998: Acquired Anacortes, Wash. refinery
2001: Acquired Salt Lake City, Utah refinery and Mandan, N.D. refinery
2002: Acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, Calif.
2007: Acquired Los Angeles Refinery – Wilmington operations in Wilmington, Calif. as well as USA Gasoline™ brand and 138 retail sites
2007-2010: Acquired 300 existing Shell®-branded wholesale supply contracts, expanding operations to a total of 650 Shell®-branded sites
2011: Formed Tesoro Logistics LP, a master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops, and acquires logistics assets to gather crude oil and distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products
2013: Expanded Los Angeles Refinery with acquisition of Carson, Calif. operations. Acquired ARCO® brand, ampm® master franchisee license and approximately 800 dealer-operated sites. Also, secured rights from ExxonMobil to use the Exxon® and Mobil® brands at retail stations in Northern California, Minnesota, Nevada, Central/Eastern North Dakota, Oregon, Northeastern South Dakota and Western Washington, and assumed ownership of branded-wholesale supply contracts for 54 Exxon- or Mobil-branded retail stations in Minnesota
2014: Established the Tesoro Foundation to advance the Company’s philanthropic mission to create cleaner, safer, well-educated communities where we operate. Acquired QEP Field Services, making Tesoro Logistics a full-service logistics company.
2015: Acquired wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska. Acquired crude oil pipelines, gathering system, transportation, storage and rail loading facilities in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, including the Tesoro Great Plains Pipeline.
2016: Acquired the Dickinson Refinery and associated logistics assets in North Dakota. Acquired Virent, an innovative renewable fuels and chemicals company, to support bringing biofuels technology to commercial scale.
2017: Acquired Western Refining and announced that on August 1, 2017, Tesoro will become Andeavor, a premier, highly integrated and geographically diversified refining, marketing and logistics company in the Western United States.

Today, Tesoro Corporation, through its subsidiaries, is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and marketers in the country, with a strategically concentrated presence in the western United States. Moving ahead, we are committed to continuing to meet and exceed the standards of safe, reliable operations, while focusing on improving profitability and increasing shareholder value.

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

Review: Proposed Tesoro project won't pose major harm


Phuong Le, Associated Press


        Updated 6:28 pm, Wednesday, July 12, 2017
    
































































SEATTLE (AP) — Proposed upgrades at the Tesoro oil refinery in Washington state won't pose major direct environmental harm, according to a county environmental review released this week.
The review by Skagit County comes after concerns raised by Native American tribes, conservation groups and others about Tesoro Corp.'s $400 million project at Anacortes.
Tesoro's plans include upgrades to help it meet upcoming federal fuel emissions guidelines. The Texas company also wants to produce a new product xylene, a chemical compound extracted during the refining process and used to make plastics and other synthetic products.
Dale Pernula, director of planning and development services for Skagit County, said the review found that "if there's a major spill there would be an impact, but the likelihood of that is low."
The review also found that increases in vessel traffic could contribute to cumulative impacts on endangered killer whales that spend time in Washington state waters.

Pernula said the review sets several conditions, including requiring Tesoro to put in place a monitoring plan for archaeological resources when it constructs three new massive storage tanks.
The refinery would produce up to 15,000 barrels a day of mixed xylenes for export to global markets. The project would add five vessels a month moving from the refinery on the Puget Sound shoreline to the Pacific Ocean.
The proposed project comes amid a larger debate in the Pacific Northwest around fossil fuels. Native American tribes and environmentalists have mobilized in recent years against a series of projects that would transform the region into a gateway for crude oil, coal and natural gas exports to Asia.
Tesoro says its Clean Products Upgrade Project will allow it to diversify its products mix and ensure the refinery's long-term viability, which in turn will benefit local communities with jobs and tax revenues.
Critics say they don't want to see the region locked for more years into burning more fossil fuels that contributes to global warming.
"We need to be phasing out oil gradually. You can't phase it out if you're making hundreds of millions in investments," said Eric de Place, policy director with the progressive Seattle-based Sightline Institute.
Tesoro is also partnering with Savage Companies to build a massive oil-export terminal along the Columbia River in southwest Washington. That proposal, currently before a state energy panel, has drawn opposition from tribes, environmental groups, some cities and a state agency over climate change and risks from oil trains.
Tesoro says there will be no increase in rail traffic because of the project upgrades.
Some have raised concerns to local regulators about increased vessel traffic, potential for more oil spills and impacts on wildlife and other natural resources.
Some worry about Tesoro's safety record, citing a 2010 explosion at the refinery that killed seven workers. Washington state regulators fined Tesoro $2.4 million in penalties. The company appealed to a state board, and last month a judge overturned that fine. The state plans to ask the state appeals board for a review.
"We are committed to safely, efficiently and reliably operating our Anacortes refinery," Tesoro spokeswoman Tina Barbee said in an email. She added that the company maintains spill prevention and contingency plans, holding 30 response drills a year.
She said the environmental impact statement released Monday by Skagit County was an important milestone.
The environment review is typically used as a guide by local, state and federal agencies as they make permitting decisions.
Several tribes including the Tulalip Tribes raised concerns that increased vessel traffic would interfere with their fishing areas, among other issues. The review found that project "is not expected to result in activities that would significantly reduce access to traditional fisheries."

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Executives[edit]
Tesoro Corporation's executive management team comprises:[15]

Greg J. Goff – President and CEO
Keith Casey – Executive Vice President, Operations
Kim K. Rucker – Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
Steven Sterin - Executive Vice President, CFO

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

Tesoro Welcomes Two New Executives
CFO Scott Spendlove is leaving to pursue other interests.

August 14, 2014, 05:25 pm



 



SAN ANTONIO -- Tesoro Corp. is adding two new members to its executive team.
Steven Sterin will join the company as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective Aug. 18, and Cynthia "CJ" Warner will join Tesoro as executive vice president, strategy and business development, effective Oct. 6.
Scott Spendlove, who has served as the company's CFO since May 2010, is leaving to pursue other interests.
"I thank Scott for his many contributions to Tesoro during his 12-year tenure and wish him all the best as he moves onto other endeavors," said Tesoro President and CEO Greg Goff.
Sterin comes to Tesoro from Celanese Corp., a global technology and specialty materials company, where he held financial leadership positions of increasing scope, including senior vice president and CFO for the last seven years. He previously worked for Reichhold Inc. and Price Waterhouse LLP. 
"With his demonstrated track record of financial and business leadership, Steven will be a great asset to Tesoro. He will be a key member of the executive team that will help us deliver on our ambitious plans," Goff said
Warner will join Tesoro from Sapphire Energy, a global provider in the development of renewable crude oil from algae, where she was president, CEO and chairman of the board over the past five years. Prior to joining Sapphire Energy, she held numerous leadership positions with BP, including group vice president of global refining and group vice president of health, safety, security, environmental and technology.
"CJ is an accomplished executive with a strong track record of delivering results. I am very pleased to have her join Tesoro and our leadership team at this exciting time for our company," Goff said. "The addition of these two talented executives strengthens our leadership capability and ability to deliver industry leading results."

San Antonio-based Tesoro Corp. is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. Tesoro's retail marketing system includes more than 2,200 retail stations under the ARCO, Shell, Exxon, Mobil, USA Gasoline and Tesoro brands.

Tesoro & Western Refining Merger Heads to a Vote 
Stockholders will meet on March 24.

February 17, 2017, 02:29 pm



 



SAN ANTONIO — Stockholders of Tesoro Corp. and Western Refining will have their say on the proposed merger next month.
According to a joint filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies set a March 24 date for the vote. 
As of the close of business on Feb. 10, the record date, stockholders from both companies will meet on March 24 to consider and cast ballots for the proposal. Tesoro stockholders will meet at 12 p.m., Central Time, and Western Refining stockholders will meet at 10 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.

Tesoro and Western Refining Inc. signed a definitive merger agreement on Nov. 17 — a move that will make Tesoro a 3,000-plus station operation, as CSNews Online previously reported.
"The acquisition is expected to create a premier and highly integrated geographically diversified refining, marketing and logistics company, and provide a strong platform for earnings growth and cash flow generation," Gregory Goff, chairman, president and CEO of Tesoro, reported during the company's earnings call on Feb. 7.
He put the expected transaction closing date during the first half of this year.
However, the deal could be delayed. On Feb. 10, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent both companies a request for more information, as CSNews Online previously reported. The inquiry could extend the merger review for up to 30 days starting from the time both companies have filed their answers.
In addition, Tesoro stockholders and Western Refining stockholders have filed separate class action suits against the transaction. A group of Tesoro stockholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company in Delaware's Chancery Court, alleging that its disclosures are inadequate and do not include key details about Goldman Sachs & Co., financial adviser to the deal.
A separate class action lawsuit filed federal court in El Paso, Texas, by Western Refining stockholders alleges that the company and its directors undervalued its stock and made misleading statements about the deal.
Tesoro offered to pay Western Refining stockholders $37.30 per share or issue 0.4350 shares of Tesoro common stock for each share of Western Refining stock when the deal was announced in November 2016.
San Antonio-based Tesoro is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products with a retail-marketing system that includes more than 2,400 retail stations under the ARCO, Shell, Exxon, Mobil, USA Gasoline, Rebel and Tesoro brands.
El Paso-based Western Refining is an independent refining and marketing company that operates refineries in El Paso and Gallup, New Mexico and St. Paul Park, Minnesota. Its retail operations includes retail service stations and convenience stores in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Texas, and Wisconsin, operating primarily under the Giant, Howdy's and SuperAmerica brands.

About Tesoro Corporation
Vision Statement
Every day we create a safer and cleaner future as efficient providers of reliable transportation fuel solutions.
Who We Are
For more than 45 years, Tesoro has been serving the fuel transportation needs of the western United States. We are a leading independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, committed to operating responsibly in the communities we serve. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, our operations extend across 18 states.
As crude oil sources, availability and costs shift, particularly in the United States, we aim to adapt to these market conditions in ways that benefit the long-term health of our business. We are expanding through strategic acquisition and organic growth, investing in capital projects and partnerships that will help lead to a successful future.
We are committed to delivering value to all of those invested in our success – the communities where we operate, our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
What We Do
Tesoro safely, efficiently and reliably operates an integrated network of strategic assets that create and sell refined petroleum products, from feedstock acquisition to wholesale, commercial and retail sales outlets.
At our refineries, Tesoro refines crude oil and other feedstocks into transportation fuels, such as conventional and CARB gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and other petroleum products, including heavy fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum coke, calcined coke and asphalt.
Our marine operations charter U.S.- and foreign-flagged tankers to optimize the transportation of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products within our refinery system.
Through our retail and marketing operations, Tesoro sells refined petroleum products via commercial, wholesale and retail channels. Commercial marketing trades in commercial and military jet fuel and heavy fuel products. Our wholesale program markets gasoline and diesel fuel to independent marketers, commercial end-users and high-volume retailers. Our network of retail stations sells gasoline and diesel fuels and convenience products directly to consumers under multiple well-known brands, including ARCO®, SuperAmerica®, Shell®, Exxon®, Mobil®, Conoco®, Tesoro®, USA Gasoline™ and Giant®.
Tesoro Corporation formed a master limited partnership, Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE: TLLP), which has a significant logistics presence in gathering, transporting, storing and distributing the crude and other feedstocks we refine.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
