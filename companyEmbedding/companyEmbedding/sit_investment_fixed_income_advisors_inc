Interests in the private investment funds are offered to a limited number of institutional and other sophisticated investors who qualify as "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.  This information does not constitute an offer to sell interests in any fund, nor is it intended to invite or permit the making of offers to purchase interests in a fund.  Many restrictions that are customarily adopted by mutual funds have not been adopted by the private investment funds.  The funds are not intended to present a balanced investment plan or a complete investment program.  There can be no assurance that a fund will achieve its objectives, and a fund could have substantial declines in the value of its portfolio securities.

To this end, we utilize a bottom-up strategy which looks for securities and market sectors with strong risk/reward potential. Although we do place a great deal of emphasis on interest rate projection and interest rate movement, we are not duration managers. Within the stated philosophy, our fixed income separate account objectives are established to: provide superior results compared to benchmarks and managers of a similar style; avoid excessive return volatility and generate consistent returns over an economic cycle; structure portfolios to meet specific client needs. 15 Investment Management Decision Making Process The day-to-day mangement of client portfolios is the responsibility of the portfolio managers who are responsible for executing the trades. Duration targets are the responsibility of Michael C. Brilley, Chief Fixed Income Officer, and interest rate decisions are the responsibility of Roger J. Sit, CEO and Global Chief Investment Officer. All transactions are reviewed on a daily basis. In addition, a monthly review of portfolio durations, sector weightings, ratings and security holdings is conducted. Assets Under Management Sit FIA manages client assets on a discretionary basis for several types of clients, including, institutional investors, pension funds, charitable institutions, foundations, endowments, corporations, and high net worth individuals. As of December 31, 2014 we managed $705 million. Please refer to Item 7 for information regarding the accounts managed by Sit FIA and its affiliated advisers: Its parent company Sit Investment Associates, Inc. and another subsidiary of its parent, Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC. Sit FIA s affiliated advisers serve as the general partner or manager for several investment companies to which the affiliates provide investment advisory services. The affiliates also manage a small percentage of their client assets through wrap fee programs sponsored by non-affiliated brokers, investment advisers, or consulting firms. 26 Fees and Compensation Item 5 The specific manner in which fees are calculated and paid to Sit FIA is established in the investment management agreement with each client. Generally, fees are stated at an annual rate, calculated quarterly as a percentage of net asset value at the end of each calendar quarter, and payable quarterly in arrears. The net asset value is generally determined based on the aggregate market value of all assets held in the account. Management fees are prorated for material capital contributions or withdrawals made during the calendar quarter, and fees are prorated for accounts initiated or terminated during the quarter. Depending on specific circumstances, such as, for example, a large amount of assets managed for a client, fees may be subject to negotiation. Sit FIA s fees are exclusive of brokerage commissions, transaction fees, and other portfolio related costs and expenses which are incurred by the client. Clients may incur charges imposed by custodians, brokers, and consultants. Item 12 further describes the factors that Sit FIA considers in selecting or recommending broker-dealers for client transactions and determining the reasonableness of the commissions. Clients may request to be billed in advance, and in the event such a client terminates its agreement, unearned fees will be promptly refunded. Clients may also request that Sit FIA send a copy of its invoice directly to its custodian, who will in turn direct payment from the client s account. Generally, clients may terminate their contract with Sit FIA on thirty days written notice, or in some cases at any time without notice. The investment management agreements are terminated automatically if assigned. All terminations are without penalty. Sit FIA provides investment management services to tax-exempt charitable organizations and makes a charitable contribution to certain of such organizations. The charitable contributions may be equal to a fixed percentage of the investment management fees paid to Sit FIA by the charitable organizations.

To this end, we utilize a bottom-up strategy which looks for securities and market sectors with strong risk/reward potential. Although we do place a great deal of emphasis on interest rate projection and interest rate movement, we are not duration managers. Within the stated philosophy, our fixed income separate account objectives are established to: provide superior results compared to benchmarks and managers of a similar style; avoid excessive return volatility and generate consistent returns over an economic cycle; structure portfolios to meet specific client needs. Taxable Fixed Income General Strategy Interest income provides the vast majority of a bond portfolio s total return over an interest rate cycle. Sit Investment s taxable fixed income process focuses on earning high levels of interest income from high quality securities. In general, we underweight U.S. Government & Agency bonds and overweight corporate, asset-backed and mortgage pass through-securities. Overall, our clients investment objectives and guidelines govern our industry and sector limits more so than the benchmark. Municipal Fixed Income General Strategy Interest income provides the vast majority of a bond portfolio s total return over an interest rate cycle. Sit Investment s municipal fixed income process focuses on strong individual security analysis and seeks investment grade quality securities which have high levels of coupon interest income and complexities such as sinking fund and prepayment provisions. The former provides income and lower volatility. The latter produces shorter expected lives and relatively higher yield. The combination is a strong book yield and after-tax return advantage using high quality securities. Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss Sit FIA manages client accounts with the following general investment strategies. Specific client objectives and restrictions are set forth in the investment management agreement with each client and differ from client to client. For example, clients may impose restrictions on investing in certain issuers or types of securities, or may define a benchmark differently than other clients. The following descriptions of investment strategies and instruments are not intended to be exhaustive. Sit FIA may employ various additional strategies and instruments from time to time in a manner consistent a client s investment management agreement. 711 Investments in the fixed income portfolios may include: Obligations of the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities; Mortgage-backed securities (including collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)); Asset-backed securities; Corporate debt securities; Municipal obligations issued by U.S. states, territories, and possessions and the District of Columbia, and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities (both revenue bonds and general obligation bonds); Closed-end registered investment companies (closed-end funds) and open-end registered investment companies (mutual funds) that invest in such fixed income securities; preferred securities and preferred convertible securities; fixed income derivatives; exchange traded futures contracts and options for hedging purposes only and not for leverage or speculative purposes; whole loans; and Short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper and bank instruments; The model portfolios used to manage client accounts include portfolios with the following objectives: Taxable Portfolios: Return Plus (closed-end bond funds) Barclays Aggregate Bond Index Total Return Barclays Aggregate Bond Index Stable Return government Barclays Intermediate Government Bond Index Stable Return government/corporate Barclays Intermediate Government/Credit Bond Index Short Duration Barclays 1 to 3-Year Government Bond Index Custom Alpha (absolute return) Tax-Exempt Portfolios: Tax-Exempt Return Plus Barclays Municipal Bond Index Tax-Exempt Total Return Barclays Municipal Bond Index Tax-Exempt Short Duration Barclays 3-Year Municipal Bond Index Tax-Exempt Stable Return Barclays 5-Year Municipal Bond Index Tax-Exempt Stable Return Barclays 7-Year Municipal Bond Index Tax-Exempt High Income Composite index of 50% Barclays Municipal Bond Index and 50% Barclays High Yield Municipal Bond Index Risks Investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear. The material risks of investing in fixed income securities include: Call Risk: Many bonds may be redeemed ( called ) at the option of the issuer before their stated maturity date. In general, an issuer will call its bonds if they can be refinanced by issuing new bonds which bear a lower interest rate. A portfolio may then be forced to invest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in a portfolio s income. 812 Credit Risk: The issuers or guarantors of securities (including U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities issuing securities that are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government) owned by a portfolio may default on the payment of principal or interest, or the other party to a contract may default on its obligations to a portfolio, causing the value of a portfolio to decrease. Credit Risk: The issuer of a debt security or a guarantor of a security held by a portfolio or counterparty to a transaction may default on its payment obligations or experience a decline in credit quality. Generally, the lower the credit rating of a security, issuer, guarantor or counterparty, the higher the degree of risk as to the payment of interest and return of principal. Also, a downgrade in the credit quality of a security or its issuer or guarantor may cause the security to decline in value and could affect the bond s liquidity and make it more difficult for a portfolio to sell. When a portfolio purchases unrated securities, it will depend on our analysis of credit risk without the assessment of an independent rating organization, such as Moody s or Standard & Poor s. There is always the risk that our analysis of creditworthiness is incorrect or may change due to market conditions. High-Yield Risk: Debt securities rated below investment-grade, or if nonrated determined to be of comparable quality by us, are commonly known as junk bonds. Junk bonds are considered predominately speculative and involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer s creditworthiness. In addition, there may be less of a market for these securities, which could make it harder to sell them at an acceptable price. These and related risks mean that a portfolio may not achieve the expected return from non-investment grade debt securities and may be adversely affected by declines in the value of these securities. Income Risk: The income a portfolio earns may decline due to declining interest rates. This is because, in a falling interest rate environment, a portfolio generally will have to invest the proceeds from maturing portfolio securities (or portfolio securities that have been called, see Call Risk below), in lower-yielding securities. Interest Rate Risk: An increase in interest rates will cause debt securities held by a portfolio to decline in value, and thereby lower a portfolio s value and its overall return. The magnitude of this decrease is often greater for longer-term fixed income securities than shorter-term securities. Liquidity Risk: The portfolio may not be able to sell certain debt securities with more limited trading opportunities at a favorable price or time, including high yield securities that have received ratings below investment grade. Recent events have caused the markets for some debt securities to experience lower valuations and reduced liquidity. Consequently, a portfolio may have to accept a lower price to sell a security, sell other securities to raise cash, or give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on a portfolio s performance. Infrequent trading may also lead to greater price volatility. Management Risk: A portfolio s performance will reflect in part our ability to implement its investment strategy and make investment decisions which are suited to achieving a portfolio s investment objective. A strategy used by us may fail to produce the intended results. A portfolio could underperform its benchmark. Market Risk: The market value of securities may fall or fail to rise. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry, or the market as a whole. The market value of securities may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The market for some types of securities is highly competitive. Portfolios will be competing for investment opportunities with a significant number of financial institutions and institutional investors. Many of these competitors are larger and have 913 greater financial, human and other resources and may in certain circumstances have a competitive advantage over the portfolio managed by us. As a result of this competition, there may be fewer attractively priced investment opportunities, which could have an adverse impact on the ability of a portfolio to meet its investment objectives or the length of time that is required for a portfolio to become fully invested. There can be no assurance that the returns on a portfolio s investments will be commensurate with the risk. Nondiversification Risk: A portfolio that is nondiversified, as is typical of single-state municipal bond portfolio, will invest a larger portion of its assets in a limited number of issuers than a diversified portfolio. Because a relatively high percentage of a portfolio s assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of issuers, the portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund. Political, Economic and Tax Risk: The value of, the income generated by, and the ability of a portfolio to sell a municipal security may be affected by constitutional amendment, legislative enactments, executive orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives as well as the economics of the regions in which the issuers in which a portfolio invests are located. Municipal securities backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or asset, such as revenue bonds, can be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. The value of municipal securities also may be adversely affected by future changes in federal or state income tax laws, including rate reductions, the imposition of a flat tax, or the loss of a current state income tax exemption. If the Internal Revenue Service determines that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the security could be treated as taxable, which could result in a decline in the security s value. To the extent that a municipal security in which a portfolio invests is not heavily followed by the investment community or such security issue is relatively small, the security may be difficult to value or sell at a fair price. Prepayment and Extension Risk: Declining interest rates may compel borrowers to prepay mortgages and debt obligations underlying the mortgage-backed securities owned by a portfolio. The proceeds received by a portfolio from prepayments will likely be reinvested at interest rates lower than the original investment, thus resulting in a reduction of income to the portfolio. Likewise, rising interest rates could reduce prepayments and extend the life of securities with lower interest rates, which may increase the sensitivity of a portfolio s value to rising interest rates. Sector Concentration Risk: Because a portfolio may invest a significant portion of their assets in health care facility bonds, housing authority bonds, and/or education bonds, a portfolio may be more affected by events influencing these sectors than a fund that is more diversified across numerous sectors. U.S. Government Securities Risk: U.S. Government agency securities in which a portfolio may invest include securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ), the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ). Securities issued by Ginnie Mae are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are supported by the right to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury. Other U.S. Government securities are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality. There is a risk that the U.S. government will not provide financial support to U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities if it is not obligated to do so by law. Securities purchased by a portfolio issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and, therefore, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. An agency of the U.S. government has placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into 1014 conservatorship with the objective of improving the entities business operations. It is unclear what effect this conservatorship will have on the securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Valuation Risk: The portfolio may hold securities for which prices from pricing services may be unavailable or are deemed unreliable. There is a risk that the fair value determined by the custodian or us or the price determined by the pricing service may be different than the actual sale prices of such securities. Closed-end Fund Risk. In addition to the general risks of investing in fixed income securities discussed above, risk factors associated with closed-end funds include market risk and concentration risk. Closed-end funds are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities. The market price of a closed-end fund may be significantly different than its NAV (a premium or a discount). Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to NAV and there is no assurance a closed-end fund will appreciate to its NAV.

Broker Dealer Subsidiary SIA Securities Corp. is a registered broker-dealer (Firm CRD# 35403, SEC File Number ) formed exclusively for and limited to the distribution of investment company shares of the Sit Mutual Funds to certain shareholders. SIA Securities Corp. does not perform any other brokerage activities, and has no employees of its own. SIA Securities Corp. is a subsidiary of Sit Investment Associates, Inc. 1317 Code of Ethics, Interest in Client Transactions and Personal Trading Item 11 Sit FIA adopted a code of ethics applicable to all employees designed to promote, among other things, honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable laws, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. The code of ethics establishes rules of conduct for all employees and is based upon the principle that the we owe a fiduciary duty to our clients to conduct our affairs, including our personal securities transactions, in such a manner as to avoid (i) serving our own personal interests ahead of clients, (ii) taking inappropriate advantage of our position with the company and (iii) any actual or potential conflicts of interest or any abuse of our position of trust and responsibility. The code of ethics is designed to ensure that our high ethical standards are continually applied. Employees are required to annually certify their compliance with the code of ethics. Sit FIA, its affiliates and employees may buy or sell for themselves securities that we also buy or sell on behalf of our clients consistent with the clients investment objectives and restrictions. Restrictions on the personal trading activities of Sit FIA s employees include, among others things: pre-clearance of all transactions; a 10 day black-out period; a restricted security list; prohibitions on short-term trading and initial public offerings; and limits on the number of transactions over certain periods of time. The code of ethics contains various exemptions for trades we believe do not involve potential conflicts, such as government securities and open-end mutual funds. The code of ethics also contains reporting requirements so that the personal trading may be monitored. The code of ethics is designed to assure that the personal securities transactions not interfere with our making decisions in the best interest of our clients. Nonetheless, because the code of ethics in some circumstances would permit employees to invest in the same securities as clients, there is a possibility that employees might benefit from market activity by a client in a security held by an employee. Other prohibitions applicable to our employees include accepting gifts of more than nominal value, and borrowing money from clients. Certain affiliated accounts may trade in the same securities with client accounts on an aggregated basis when consistent with Sit FIA's obligation of best execution. In such circumstances, the affiliated and client accounts will share commission costs equally and receive securities at a total average price. Sit FIA s clients or prospective clients may request a copy of the firm's code of ethics by contacting Paul Rasmussen at18 Brokerage Practices Item 12 Trading of Bonds Fixed income securities are generally purchased from or sold to brokers or dealers. Broker-dealers maintain inventories of bonds that they own as principals and hold for resale to their customers. In purchasing and selling bonds for client accounts, we attempt to contact multiple brokers before executing a trade in order to seek best execution. When we purchase bonds we seek specific bond issues or we seek bonds with certain characteristics including type, sector, maturity, duration, coupon and yield objectives. When acting as principal the broker will typically add a markup to any purchase, and subtract a markdown from every sale. The markup or markdown will be included in the price and yield of the security. Closed-end registered investment companies (closed-end funds) trade as equity securities on a national exchange and the broker charges a commission based on the number of shares. Research and Soft Dollar Benefits In effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities for client accounts (including investment companies) we will seek best execution of the orders. Consistent with this policy, orders for portfolio transactions are placed with broker-dealer firms giving consideration to the quality, quantity and nature of the firm's professional services which include execution, clearance procedures and market, statistical and other research information provided to Sit FIA and its clients. All these factors are taken into account in the allocation of brokerage and thus lowest price is not necessarily the determining factor. Sit FIA feels that it is to the overall benefit of its clients and clients of its subsidiary to receive these benefits from broker-dealers and not to have to duplicate these services by expensive additions to Sit FIA s staff. Nothing in this policy relieves Sit FIA of its responsibility of reviewing the research and making the ultimate determination on transactions based on its own expertise. It is quite possible that the research benefits received from any one order will not inure to the direct benefit of the client including a mutual fund placing the order but we feel that the aggregate benefits of information received from all orders will benefit all our clients, including the clients of our subsidiaries. While Sit FIA will be primarily responsible for the allocation of the client's brokerage business, the policies and practices for Sit FIA in this regard must be consistent with the foregoing and will at all times be subject to review by the client. During 2014, Sit FIA s affiliate, Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC and its parent company, Sit Investment Associates, Inc. received approximately 16 different services and products from 6 different broker-dealers from soft-dollar arrangements. The affiliates received both proprietary research which is created or developed by the broker-dealer, and research created or developed by a third party. Among the services and products received were: financial, economic, and political information services and research reports; periodic specialized financial market research; financial market statistical information; industry and sector analysis; economic, political and market commentary; issuer credit research; on-line bond trading services; quantitative research and analysis; and market prices and quotation services. A complete list of the services and products received is available to clients upon request. Although we seek best execution of transactions, obtaining research and services by means of soft dollar arrangements represents a conflict of interest since it enables us to receive research that we might otherwise have to purchase with our own money. Therefore, we may have an incentive to select a brokerdealer based on our interest in receiving the research or other products or services, rather than our clients interest in receiving most favorable execution. We may cause clients to pay commissions higher than those charged by other broker-dealers in return for soft dollar benefits. 1519 Order Aggregation The aggregation or blocking of client transactions allows Sit FIA to execute transactions in a more timely, equitable, and efficient manner and seeks to reduce overall commission charges to clients. Our policy is to aggregate client transactions where possible and when advantageous to clients. In these instances clients participating in any aggregated transactions will receive an average share price and transaction costs will be shared equally and on a pro-rata basis. Our policy prohibits any allocation of trades in a manner that our proprietary accounts, affiliated accounts, or any particular client(s) or group of clients receive more favorable treatment than other client accounts. Sit FIA has adopted a policy for the fair and equitable allocation of transactions using a pro-rata allocation method. Equity security transactions are processed using an electronic order management system. Transactions are allocated to all applicable client accounts based on portfolio characteristics such as account size, cash levels, the model portfolio target weightings, and investment restrictions. Fixed income security transactions are allocated by the trader to all applicable client accounts based on portfolio characteristics such as cash and liquidity requirements, portfolio duration, quality requirements, and investment restrictions. Certain clients have directed us to use a particular broker in effecting purchases and sales of its portfolio securities, and therefore, our services would not include selection of brokerage firms or negotiation of commission rates. Generally, under such circumstances, the client may receive products or services from the broker directly. If a client chooses to direct its brokerage to a broker other than the one through which Sit FIA will execute orders for its other clients, the client will forgo any benefit from savings on execution costs that the adviser could obtain for its other clients through, for example, discounts on batched orders. In some situations we may execute a transaction with one broker and settle the transaction with another broker. This use of step-outs allows us to split the execution services and the research services from the brokers, that is by executing a transaction with an execution broker and step-out the transaction and related commissions to a broker who provides research services to book and settle the transaction. Cross Trades Sit FIA may under certain circumstances effect cross-trades which means the purchase and sale of a security between two or more accounts (including pooled investment funds) managed by us or our affiliates. In certain situations it is advantageous to clients to engage in a cross-trade. These situations can arise for many reasons. Often an account will have incoming cash that needs to be invested and at the same time another account is withdrawing funds and needs to sell portfolio securities to raise cash. Another situation in which a cross-trade may be desirable is when the characteristics of a particular security change. Since Sit FIA serves as the investment adviser for both the buyer and the seller of the security, there may be an inherent conflict of interest. All cross-trades are executed at a fair price and no client is disfavored by the transaction. Sit FIA receives no compensation from effecting a cross-trade. Sit FIA has policies and procedures to ensure the transactions are done on a fair and equitable basis and in the best interests of the clients. Where a registered investment company is involved in the transaction, the requirements of Rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are complied with. Commissions are not paid on purchases and sales between registered investment companies subject to Rule 17a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, but such transactions may be charged transfer fees. If in the event an account subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) was involved in the transaction, the requirements of section 408(b)(19) of ERISA would be complied with. 1620 Generally, Sit FIA effects a cross-trade by placing simultaneous buy and sell orders for a security through an independent broker-dealer, who then effects both transactions at a determined commission. Sit FIA does not intend to execute a cross-trade by instructing the custodians to transfer the security from one client s account to the other. Notwithstanding the above, Sit FIA may initiate the purchase and sale of a security in the market on behalf of two or more clients on the same day but through different independent broker-dealers and/or at different times of the day. Generally, such a transaction is not considered a cross-trade for purposes of the cross-trade procedures. 1721 Review of Accounts Item 13 Client accounts receive almost constant review from the professional staff, including the members of the Investment Committee and the research and investment management professionals. At least one investment professional is assigned prime responsibility for a client s account, and the investment committee structure facilitates frequent account review through weekly meetings of the Investment Committee and the other investment professionals, as well as numerous informal meetings among the investment professionals. All transactions are reviewed daily by the Chief Investment Officer. Sit FIA furnishes each client (except clients participating in a wrap program) with written reports regarding the client s portfolio which includes holdings, transactions, investment performance, the investment strategy, and other pertinent information tailored to the needs of the particular client. Portfolio reports are provided monthly, or as requested by the client. The written reports are often supplemented by frequent oral reports to the client from an investment professional and also by regular review meetings with the client as requested by the client. Client Referrals and Other Compensation Item 14 Sit FIA does not compensate anyone for referring clients to us, nor do we receive compensation from other professionals for referring clients to them. Custody Item 15 Sit FIA does not maintain physical custody of client assets. Clients are responsible for selecting and engaging a custodian. Clients should receive statements from the qualified custodian that holds and maintains the client s assets at least quarterly. Clients should carefully review such statements and compare such official custodial records to the account statements that we provide to you. Our statements may vary from custodial statements based on accounting procedures, reporting dates, or valuation methodologies of certain securities. Sit FIA s affiliates provide investment advisory services and serve as general partner or manager to private investment companies organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies, and therefore may be deemed to have custody or possession of client assets for purposes of Rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of Investment Discretion Item 16 Sit FIA manages client assets on a discretionary basis pursuant to the investment management agreement with each client. Investment discretion is exercised in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and restrictions for the particular client account as set forth in the investment management agreement. Clients may impose restrictions including, for example, on investing in certain companies or types of securities. 18  View more

Fixed income products








What are fixed income investments?

Fixed income1 investments generally provide an established return on a fixed schedule. One of the most popular types of fixed income products are bonds, through which you lend money to a government, municipality, corporation, federal agency or other entity known as an issuer. In return for that money, the issuer provides you with a bond in which it promises to pay a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the face value of the bond (the principal) when it matures, or comes due. Many of these investments can offer tax-free returns on the municipal, state and federal levels. Individual bonds can be useful in a strategy that seeks to preserve capital and generate a predicable return when they are held to maturity, subject to issuer credit risk2. 
An array of fixed income products 
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. offers access to a wide variety of fixed income products including:

Municipal bonds: Debts issued by states, municipalities or counties that are free from federal taxes and usually free of state and local taxes3. Municipal Securities may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.
 When investing in fixed income products you should seek tax advice from your independent tax advisor. 
Treasury notes and bonds: U.S. Government debt that carries a fixed interest rate, usually with a maturity of 1-10 years. Interest income is exempt from state and local income taxes, but subject to federal income taxes.4
Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) / Agency: Bonds issued by financing entities created by Congress to fund loans to certain groups of borrowers such as homeowners, farmers and students. i.e. Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) are privately owned corporations, while the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks are systems comprising regional banks. All GSE debt is not guaranteed by the federal government, whereas government agencies such as Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) are divisions of the government whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
Sovereign bonds: Issued by a national government and denominated in a foreign currency5
Domestic corporate bonds 
Bond Funds6
Brokered CDs7

Help from a Financial Professional8
As a client of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., you can rest assured knowing that an experienced financial professional can help you determine if fixed income investments align to your personal objectives and risk tolerance, and can help you evaluate which specific products may fit within your diversification strategy.
For more information about fixed income products, or to schedule a financial review, call us at 866.586.4722 or 
   schedule a consultation online. 

Investment and certain insurance products, including annuities, are offered by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (HSI), member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC. In California, HSI conducts insurance business as HSBC Securities Insurance Services. License #: OE67746.  HSI is an affiliate of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. Whole life, universal life, term life, and other types of insurance are provided by unaffiliated third parties and offered through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Bank USA, National Association. Products and services may vary by state and are not available in all states. California license #: OD36843.



Investment, Annuity and Insurance Products:



ARE NOT A BANK DEPOSIT OR OBLIGATION OF THE BANK OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
ARE NOT FDIC INSURED
ARE NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY
ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY THE BANK OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
MAY LOSE VALUE



All decisions regarding the tax implications of your investment(s) should be made in connection with your independent tax advisor.
Research backgrounds of brokers and brokerage firms for free by visiting FINRA's BrokerCheck website
United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non-U.S. accounts - including, for example, Form TD F 90-22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ("FBAR")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.
1 Fixed income products are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity and market risks, to varying degrees. 
2 Investments subject to the credit risk of the issuer are generally the obligations of the issuer and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the investments with credit risk, including any return of principal or coupon payable at maturity, if applicable, depends on the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of an issuer may affect the market value of an investment with such credit risk and, in the event an issuer were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the investment.
3 Municipal bonds: Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges and expenses associated with municipal securities before investing. Further information about municipal securities is available in the issuer's official statement. The official statement should be read carefully before investing. 
4 U.S. Treasuries are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the U.S. Government
5 Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy.  These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.  Prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of companies in more developed countries.  Securities of emerging market issuers generally have more risk than securities issued by issuers in more developed markets.  The less developed the country, the greater affect the risks  may have in an investment, and as a result, an investment may exhibit a higher degree of volatility than either the general domestic securities market or the securities markets of developed foreign countries.
6 Investors should be aware that the fund's yield and the value of its portfolio fluctuate and can be affected by changes in interest rates, general market conditions and other political, social and economic developments. However, investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price, especially for longer-term issues and in environments of rising interest rates. Investments in bond funds are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of the underlying securities and their inability to meet their current obligations.  These risks may increase the funds share price volatility.
7 All CDs are FDIC insured together with all other deposits you may have with the issuing bank, up to the current maximum amount of $250,000 per depositor. For further guidance on FDIC insurance coverage, please visit www.FDIC.gov.
8 Financial professional refers to Premier Wealth Advisors (PWA), Premier Relationship Advisors (PRA) and Financial Advisors (FA).  PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.
An investment in a bond fund should be preceded or accompanied by an effective prospectus and investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus of a fund contains this and other important information about the investment company. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing in a fund.

Fixed Income Strategies
Constructing Client Portfolios with a Forward-Looking Approach.




Our Investments > Fixed Income Strategies 
The philosophy behind FCI’s fixed income investment strategy is the belief that bond portfolios represent the more stable portion of an overall investment allocation and are primarily utilized to offset the volatility of riskier assets such as equities.
It is not our approach, therefore, to squeeze out the last bit of return from some of the less liquid or riskier corners of the bond market. Instead, our philosophy is to employ a time-tested disciplined investment process to construct a high-quality portfolio that is suitable for the given set of market conditions.
FCI’s Fixed Income Styles
Intermediate Fixed Income Strategy
Investment Objective
FCI’s fixed income investment strategy seeks to deliver superior returns relative to the Barclays Capital Intermediate Government/Credit Index over a market cycle, while limiting the risk incurred by maintaining a high credit profile. We strive to consistently move the portfolio in the direction of best opportunities while reducing the potential of a significantly negative credit event.
Core Fixed Income Strategy
Investment Objective
FCI’s fixed income investment strategy seeks to deliver superior returns relative to the Barclays Capital Government/Credit A+ Rated Index over a market cycle, while limiting the risk incurred by maintaining a high credit profile. We strive to consistently move the portfolio in the direction of best opportunities while reducing the potential of a significantly negative credit event.
Government Credit Fixed Income Strategy
Investment Objective
FCI’s fixed income investment strategy seeks to deliver superior returns relative to the Barclays Capital Government/Credit A+ Rated Index over a market cycle, while limiting the risk incurred by maintaining a high credit profile. We strive to consistently move the portfolio in the direction of best opportunities while reducing the potential of a significantly negative credit event.
Tax-Advantaged Preferred Strategy
Investment Objective
Leveraging FCI’s corporate credit expertise, the objective of the strategy is to provide a superior investment alternative to a passively constructed preferred ETF portfolio. From a risk and return perspective, the objective is to outperform the iShares Preferred Share ETF (PFF) while delivering a lower risk profile. We believe that our preferred stock strategy can outperform the PFF over a market cycle.
All Corporate Income Strategy
Investment Objective
FCI’s fixed income investment strategy seeks to deliver superior returns relative to the Merrill Lynch Corporate Intermediate A+ Index over a market cycle, while limiting the risk incurred by maintaining a high credit profile. We strive to consistently move the portfolio in the direction of best opportunities while reducing the potential of a significantly negative credit event.
