            I absolutely loved this Radio Theatre version of Anne of Green Gables. It is so well-done. It sticks to the book more closely than does the movie. I really like when a dramatization based on a book actually follows the book.  I'm very familiar with the book, and I can only think of one time (offhand) where the Radio Theatre version deviated from the book.  The Radio Theatre dramatization is also nice for those who are familiar with the movie because many of the actors chosen for the Radio Theatre version are vocally similar to the actors from the movie.
