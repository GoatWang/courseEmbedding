                            / Lucia van der PostEmailTwitterPinterestFacebookJulia Dee is the wardrobe guru behind the best-smelling moth prevention I’ve come across. Devoted as she is to looking after clothes, she has now created products to help the traveller, such as a Wet Bag (pictured, £5), for when you’ve been swimming and are flying later, and a set of three Packing Cubes (£26), to organise and separate underwear, belts, scarves, travel adaptors or anything else.AdvertisementAdvertisementShare this articleEmailTwitterPinterestFacebookRelatedPersonal LuxuriesKeep your cashmere moth-free, and smelling goodSee alsoJulia DeeAdvertisementLoad next articleLoadingFinancial Times - How to Spend itCloseSearch How to Spend itSearch
