Description

    This book addresses ethical issues and principles in human services professions including social work, counseling, psychology, and marriage and family therapy. All of these professions must be sensitive to ethical standards and dilemmas, particularly given the increase in litigation surrounding ethical issues. This book leads the reader through a personal journey of discovery, assessment, and clarification of values and ethics. The focus is to help the reader assimilate ethical principles, thus becoming an ethical practitioner. The book reflects the ethical codes of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the AmericanPsychological Association (APA), National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). Sound pedagogy includes learning objectives, cases, and guided exercises, all intended to raise the reader's self-awareness of issues of values, ethics, and professional standards.

Early life[edit]
Parsons was born to an African-American family in Brooklyn, New York, on April 4, 1948.[1] He was one of five children. His maternal grandfather had been head groundskeeper at Kykuit.[4] Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Parsons's father, Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, was an electrical technician and his mother, Isabelle (née Judd) was a homemaker.[5] He skipped a grade in elementary school and another in high school.[5] He later attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where at 6'4" tall he may have played varsity basketball.[6] After four years, he was seven credits short of his diploma. However, he discovered that he could get into a law school in New York without a college degree if he scored well enough on his pre-law exams. Parsons was accepted by Albany Law School, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 1971, finishing at the top of his class.[5]
Career[edit]
In 1971, Parsons served an internship at the New York State Legislature, at which time he was invited to work as a lawyer for the staff of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. When Rockefeller was appointed Vice President of the United States, in 1974, Parsons followed him to Washington D.C., where he worked directly with President Gerald Ford. He also met a deputy attorney general, Harold R. Tyler, and one of his aides, a young Rudolph W. Giuliani, with whom he was to be closely associated - supporting him in his campaign for New York mayor and heading his transitional council.[7]
In 1977, Parsons returned to New York and became a partner after only two years at the Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler law firm; also working at the firm was Giuliani. During his 11 years at the firm Parsons took on Happy Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson (who had died in 1979) as a high-profile client.[8] In 1988, he was recruited to serve as chief operating officer of the Dime Savings Bank of New York by CEO Harry W. Albright Jr., who was a former Rockefeller aide. Parsons later became Chairman and CEO[7] and oversaw a merger with Anchor Savings Bank, gaining a substantial sum when the Dime Bank was demutualized.
Three years later, in 1991, on the recommendation of Nelson's brother Laurance Rockefeller to the then CEO Steven Ross, Parsons was invited to join Time Warner's board; he subsequently became president of the company in 1995, recruited by Gerald Levin.[7] He helped negotiate the company's merger with America Online in 2000, creating a $165-billion media conglomerate.[9]
In December 2001, it was announced that chief executive Gerald Levin would retire and Parsons had been selected as his successor. The announcement surprised many media watchers who expected chief operating officer Robert Pittman to take the helm. In 2003, Parsons made the announcement of the name change from AOL Time Warner to simply Time Warner.[8]
Parsons became chairman of Citigroup on 23 February 2009.[10] He is chairman of the Advisory Board of Feigen Advisors, a CEO advisory firm run by Marc Feigen.[11]
Humanitarian causes[edit]
In 2007, Parsons became the chairman of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America.[12] He has worked with the foundation to save the homes and the lives of America's elderly jazz and blues musicians, including musicians who survived Hurricane Katrina, such as Fats Domino.[13]
In June 2016, Parsons was appointed Board Chair of The Rockefeller Foundation, a foundation promoting the wellbeing of humanity all over the world. He joined the foundation's Board of Trustees in 2008.[14][15]
Prominent connections[edit]
From the early 1980s through much of the 1990s, Parsons owned a house near the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills (see Kykuit), where his grandfather was once a groundskeeper. For a brief time he had worked for Nelson at the family office, "Room 5600", at Rockefeller Center.[7]
Parsons became chairman emeritus of the Partnership for New York City,[16] established by David Rockefeller in 1979,[17] who has known him for many years. He became an advisory trustee of the family's principal philanthropy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and he sits with David Rockefeller on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. Parsons is also on the board of the family created Museum of Modern Art.
In 2001, United States President George W. Bush selected Parsons to co-chair a commission on Social Security. Parsons also worked on the transition team for Michael Bloomberg, who was elected Mayor of New York City in 2001. In 2006, Parsons was selected to co-chair the transition team for the incoming Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer.[18]
In August 2006, an article in New York Magazine reported that Parsons would likely run for Mayor of New York City in the 2009 New York mayoral election.[19] Parsons, however, repeatedly denied the reports,[20] supported Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to repeal the term limits law, and supported Bloomberg for a third term in office.[21]
Parsons was a member of the economic advisory team for President Barack Obama. He met with the then President-elect on Friday, November 7, 2008, along with many other economic experts, to discuss measures to solve the current economic crisis. After New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson withdrew his name from consideration for the position of Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration, Parsons's name was floated as a possible nominee.[22]
On May 9, 2014, in the wake of the Donald Sterling racial remarks controversy, it was announced that Richard Parsons was appointed the interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers.[23]
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Laura Ann Bush, a community activist with a doctorate in child psychology, who he met at the University of Hawaii. They have three grown children: Gregory, Leslie, and Rebecca.[1][24]
In 2009, he had a child with model-philanthropist MacDella Cooper.[24][25] Being of Liberian ethnicity, Cooper founded the MacDella Cooper Foundation in 2004 to help orphans and abandoned children in Liberia following the Second Liberian Civil War.[24]

Early life[edit]
Parsons was born to an African-American family in Brooklyn, New York, on April 4, 1948.[1] He was one of five children. His maternal grandfather had been head groundskeeper at Kykuit.[4] Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Parsons's father, Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, was an electrical technician and his mother, Isabelle (née Judd) was a homemaker.[5] He skipped a grade in elementary school and another in high school.[5] He later attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where at 6'4" tall he may have played varsity basketball.[6] After four years, he was seven credits short of his diploma. However, he discovered that he could get into a law school in New York without a college degree if he scored well enough on his pre-law exams. Parsons was accepted by Albany Law School, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 1971, finishing at the top of his class.[5]
Career[edit]
In 1971, Parsons served an internship at the New York State Legislature, at which time he was invited to work as a lawyer for the staff of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. When Rockefeller was appointed Vice President of the United States, in 1974, Parsons followed him to Washington D.C., where he worked directly with President Gerald Ford. He also met a deputy attorney general, Harold R. Tyler, and one of his aides, a young Rudolph W. Giuliani, with whom he was to be closely associated - supporting him in his campaign for New York mayor and heading his transitional council.[7]
In 1977, Parsons returned to New York and became a partner after only two years at the Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler law firm; also working at the firm was Giuliani. During his 11 years at the firm Parsons took on Happy Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson (who had died in 1979) as a high-profile client.[8] In 1988, he was recruited to serve as chief operating officer of the Dime Savings Bank of New York by CEO Harry W. Albright Jr., who was a former Rockefeller aide. Parsons later became Chairman and CEO[7] and oversaw a merger with Anchor Savings Bank, gaining a substantial sum when the Dime Bank was demutualized.
Three years later, in 1991, on the recommendation of Nelson's brother Laurance Rockefeller to the then CEO Steven Ross, Parsons was invited to join Time Warner's board; he subsequently became president of the company in 1995, recruited by Gerald Levin.[7] He helped negotiate the company's merger with America Online in 2000, creating a $165-billion media conglomerate.[9]
In December 2001, it was announced that chief executive Gerald Levin would retire and Parsons had been selected as his successor. The announcement surprised many media watchers who expected chief operating officer Robert Pittman to take the helm. In 2003, Parsons made the announcement of the name change from AOL Time Warner to simply Time Warner.[8]
Parsons became chairman of Citigroup on 23 February 2009.[10] He is chairman of the Advisory Board of Feigen Advisors, a CEO advisory firm run by Marc Feigen.[11]
Humanitarian causes[edit]
In 2007, Parsons became the chairman of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America.[12] He has worked with the foundation to save the homes and the lives of America's elderly jazz and blues musicians, including musicians who survived Hurricane Katrina, such as Fats Domino.[13]
In June 2016, Parsons was appointed Board Chair of The Rockefeller Foundation, a foundation promoting the wellbeing of humanity all over the world. He joined the foundation's Board of Trustees in 2008.[14][15]
Prominent connections[edit]
From the early 1980s through much of the 1990s, Parsons owned a house near the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills (see Kykuit), where his grandfather was once a groundskeeper. For a brief time he had worked for Nelson at the family office, "Room 5600", at Rockefeller Center.[7]
Parsons became chairman emeritus of the Partnership for New York City,[16] established by David Rockefeller in 1979,[17] who has known him for many years. He became an advisory trustee of the family's principal philanthropy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and he sits with David Rockefeller on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. Parsons is also on the board of the family created Museum of Modern Art.
In 2001, United States President George W. Bush selected Parsons to co-chair a commission on Social Security. Parsons also worked on the transition team for Michael Bloomberg, who was elected Mayor of New York City in 2001. In 2006, Parsons was selected to co-chair the transition team for the incoming Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer.[18]
In August 2006, an article in New York Magazine reported that Parsons would likely run for Mayor of New York City in the 2009 New York mayoral election.[19] Parsons, however, repeatedly denied the reports,[20] supported Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to repeal the term limits law, and supported Bloomberg for a third term in office.[21]
Parsons was a member of the economic advisory team for President Barack Obama. He met with the then President-elect on Friday, November 7, 2008, along with many other economic experts, to discuss measures to solve the current economic crisis. After New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson withdrew his name from consideration for the position of Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration, Parsons's name was floated as a possible nominee.[22]
On May 9, 2014, in the wake of the Donald Sterling racial remarks controversy, it was announced that Richard Parsons was appointed the interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers.[23]
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Laura Ann Bush, a community activist with a doctorate in child psychology, who he met at the University of Hawaii. They have three grown children: Gregory, Leslie, and Rebecca.[1][24]
In 2009, he had a child with model-philanthropist MacDella Cooper.[24][25] Being of Liberian ethnicity, Cooper founded the MacDella Cooper Foundation in 2004 to help orphans and abandoned children in Liberia following the Second Liberian Civil War.[24]

Early life[edit]
Parsons was born to an African-American family in Brooklyn, New York, on April 4, 1948.[1] He was one of five children. His maternal grandfather had been head groundskeeper at Kykuit.[4] Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Parsons's father, Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, was an electrical technician and his mother, Isabelle (née Judd) was a homemaker.[5] He skipped a grade in elementary school and another in high school.[5] He later attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where at 6'4" tall he may have played varsity basketball.[6] After four years, he was seven credits short of his diploma. However, he discovered that he could get into a law school in New York without a college degree if he scored well enough on his pre-law exams. Parsons was accepted by Albany Law School, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 1971, finishing at the top of his class.[5]
Career[edit]
In 1971, Parsons served an internship at the New York State Legislature, at which time he was invited to work as a lawyer for the staff of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. When Rockefeller was appointed Vice President of the United States, in 1974, Parsons followed him to Washington D.C., where he worked directly with President Gerald Ford. He also met a deputy attorney general, Harold R. Tyler, and one of his aides, a young Rudolph W. Giuliani, with whom he was to be closely associated - supporting him in his campaign for New York mayor and heading his transitional council.[7]
In 1977, Parsons returned to New York and became a partner after only two years at the Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler law firm; also working at the firm was Giuliani. During his 11 years at the firm Parsons took on Happy Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson (who had died in 1979) as a high-profile client.[8] In 1988, he was recruited to serve as chief operating officer of the Dime Savings Bank of New York by CEO Harry W. Albright Jr., who was a former Rockefeller aide. Parsons later became Chairman and CEO[7] and oversaw a merger with Anchor Savings Bank, gaining a substantial sum when the Dime Bank was demutualized.
Three years later, in 1991, on the recommendation of Nelson's brother Laurance Rockefeller to the then CEO Steven Ross, Parsons was invited to join Time Warner's board; he subsequently became president of the company in 1995, recruited by Gerald Levin.[7] He helped negotiate the company's merger with America Online in 2000, creating a $165-billion media conglomerate.[9]
In December 2001, it was announced that chief executive Gerald Levin would retire and Parsons had been selected as his successor. The announcement surprised many media watchers who expected chief operating officer Robert Pittman to take the helm. In 2003, Parsons made the announcement of the name change from AOL Time Warner to simply Time Warner.[8]
Parsons became chairman of Citigroup on 23 February 2009.[10] He is chairman of the Advisory Board of Feigen Advisors, a CEO advisory firm run by Marc Feigen.[11]
Humanitarian causes[edit]
In 2007, Parsons became the chairman of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America.[12] He has worked with the foundation to save the homes and the lives of America's elderly jazz and blues musicians, including musicians who survived Hurricane Katrina, such as Fats Domino.[13]
In June 2016, Parsons was appointed Board Chair of The Rockefeller Foundation, a foundation promoting the wellbeing of humanity all over the world. He joined the foundation's Board of Trustees in 2008.[14][15]
Prominent connections[edit]
From the early 1980s through much of the 1990s, Parsons owned a house near the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills (see Kykuit), where his grandfather was once a groundskeeper. For a brief time he had worked for Nelson at the family office, "Room 5600", at Rockefeller Center.[7]
Parsons became chairman emeritus of the Partnership for New York City,[16] established by David Rockefeller in 1979,[17] who has known him for many years. He became an advisory trustee of the family's principal philanthropy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and he sits with David Rockefeller on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. Parsons is also on the board of the family created Museum of Modern Art.
In 2001, United States President George W. Bush selected Parsons to co-chair a commission on Social Security. Parsons also worked on the transition team for Michael Bloomberg, who was elected Mayor of New York City in 2001. In 2006, Parsons was selected to co-chair the transition team for the incoming Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer.[18]
In August 2006, an article in New York Magazine reported that Parsons would likely run for Mayor of New York City in the 2009 New York mayoral election.[19] Parsons, however, repeatedly denied the reports,[20] supported Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to repeal the term limits law, and supported Bloomberg for a third term in office.[21]
Parsons was a member of the economic advisory team for President Barack Obama. He met with the then President-elect on Friday, November 7, 2008, along with many other economic experts, to discuss measures to solve the current economic crisis. After New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson withdrew his name from consideration for the position of Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration, Parsons's name was floated as a possible nominee.[22]
On May 9, 2014, in the wake of the Donald Sterling racial remarks controversy, it was announced that Richard Parsons was appointed the interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers.[23]
Personal life[edit]
In 1968, he married Laura Ann Bush, a community activist with a doctorate in child psychology, who he met at the University of Hawaii. They have three grown children: Gregory, Leslie, and Rebecca.[1][24]
In 2009, he had a child with model-philanthropist MacDella Cooper.[24][25] Being of Liberian ethnicity, Cooper founded the MacDella Cooper Foundation in 2004 to help orphans and abandoned children in Liberia following the Second Liberian Civil War.[24]

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Ethics Of Professional Practiceby Parsons, Richard D.This book addresses ethical issues and principles in human services professions including social work, counseling, psychology, and marriage and family therapy. All of these professions must be sensitive to ethical standards and dilemmas, particularly given the increase in litigation surrounding ethical issues. This book leads the reader through a personal journey of discovery, assessment, and clarification of values and ethics. The focus is to help the reader assimilate ethical principles, thus becoming an ethical practitioner. The book reflects the ethical codes of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the American Psychological Association (APA), National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). Sound pedagogy includes learning objectives, cases, and guided exercises, all intended to raise the reader's self-awareness of issues of values, ethics, and professional standards.For professionals in social work, counseling, psychology, or marriage and family therapy.Ethics & Moral Philosophy, General, Social WorkCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Synopsis
About this title




   This book addresses ethical issues and principles in human services professions including social work, counseling, psychology, and marriage and family therapy. All of these professions must be sensitive to ethical standards and dilemmas, particularly given the increase in litigation surrounding ethical issues. This book leads the reader through a personal journey of discovery, assessment, and clarification of values and ethics. The focus is to help the reader assimilate ethical principles, thus becoming an ethical practitioner.   The book reflects the ethical codes of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the American Psychological Association (APA), National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). Sound pedagogy includes learning objectives, cases, and guided exercises, all intended to raise the reader's self-awareness of issues of values, ethics, and professional standards.   For professionals in social work, counseling, psychology, or marriage and family therapy.
