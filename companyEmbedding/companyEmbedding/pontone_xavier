Method and device for producing air gases in a gaseous and liquid form with a high flexibility and by cryogenic distillation



Patent number:  8997520
                                            

Abstract:  A method of producing at least one air gas using cryogenic distillation is provided. The expanded streams coming from the two turbines are combined and then split into two fractions. The first fraction is sent to the medium-pressure column of the system in gaseous form, whereas the second fraction is returned to the cold end of the heat exchange line. At a temperature T4 below ?100° C. and above T2, the second fraction is sent to a turbine where it expands up to a temperature T5, forming an air stream. This air stream is then warmed in the heat exchange line before being discharged into the atmosphere, so that the distillation is not disturbed. A liquid product is withdrawn from the column system as final product. The sole liquid product from the apparatus is liquid oxygen, but of course other products may be produced.

Publication number:  20110192193
                                            

Abstract:  The invention relates to a method of enriching a pressurised gas stream (1) with one of the components (A) thereof. The inventive method comprises the following steps: the stream is separated into at least first and second fractions (2, 3); at least one part of the first fraction (2) is sent to a separation unit (ASU); the separation unit supplies at least two discharges, including a first discharge (10) having a greater A content than that of the fraction (2) supplied to the separation unit; at least one part of the first discharge (10) is mixed with at least one part of the second fraction (3) such as to form a pressurised gas mixture (15); the second fraction (3) is expanded and, subsequently, at least one part of the first discharge (10) is mixed therein.

Method and installation for producing, in gaseous form and under high pressure, at least one fluid chosen from oxygen, argon and nitrogen by cryogenic distillation of air



Patent number:  7370494
                                            

Abstract:  A process and apparatus for highly efficient production of industrial gases by the cryogenic distillation of air, wherein a feed stream of compressed air, is supercharged to high pressure, cooled, and mixed with various recycle streams of supercharged air, to regulate the expander turbine operating temperature.

Method and installation for producing, in gaseous form and under high pressure, at least one fluid chosen from oxygen, argon and nitrogen by cryogenic distillation of air



Patent number:  7076971
                                            

Abstract:  A process and apparatus for highly efficient production of industrial gases by the cryogenic distillation of air, wherein a feed stream of compressed air, is supercharged to high pressure, cooled, and mixed with various recycle streams of supercharged air, to regulate the expander turbine operating temperature. The need for pre-cooling equipment downstream of the supercharger, which is widely employed in industry to manage the temperature of the incoming compressed air stream, is eliminated.

Publication number:  20040221612
                                            

Abstract:  In a method of producing a high-pressure gas in an air separation unit, all the air intended for distillation is compressed in a compressor (1), the compressed air is purified, at least a first portion of the air is supercharged to a high pressure, the compressed and purified air is sent into a heat exchange line (6) of the unit where it cools, the compressed, purified and cooled air is separated in a system of columns of the unit comprising at least one distillation column (8, 9), a fluid (16) is withdrawn in the liquid state from one column of the system of columns, the said fluid is brought in the liquid state to the high pressure, it is vaporized by heat exchange with the air and the vaporized liquid at this high pressure is warmed in the heat exchange line of the installation, at least one portion of the supercharged air is expanded in an expansion turbine (4) from the high pressure to a second pressure, the expanded air then being sent into one column of the system of columns and during start-up of the

Mr. Pontone is the Managing Director of Air Liquide Advanced Businesses based in Sassenage, France, since 2013.  He acts as Chairman of Fordonsgas AB, which is a company operating bio methane fueling stations in Sweden since 2014.  He is also Chairman of Copenhagen Hydrogen Newwork A/S, which is a company operating hydrogen fueling stations in Denmark since 2014.   Mr. Pontone sat on the board of directors of Hypulsion, the Company's joint venture with Axane, S.A. (an Air Liquide subsidiary), through July 31, 2015.   As of August 1, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of Hypulsion, at which point Mr. Pontone was no longer a board member of Hypulsion.   Mr. Pontone also sits on the boards of Air Liquide Advanced Businesses and Technologies UK in the UK, Air Liquide Advanced Technologies Gmbh in Germany, Air Liquide Advanced Technologies in France, Societe des Taxis Electriques Parsiens in France, and Fonroch Biogas in France.    We believe Mr. Pontone's qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include his senior management experience in the hydrogen mobility and energy space in European markets.
