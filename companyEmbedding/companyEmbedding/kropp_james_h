Mr. Kropp currently serves as chief investment officer of SLKW Investments LLC, successor to i3 Funds LLC, a position he has held since 2008. He is also a manager of Microproperties LLC, where he has served in this capacity since 2011. He was the interim chief financial officer of TaxEase LLC, a property tax lender and tax lien investor from 2010 to February 2012. Between January 2006 and December 2008, he served as senior vice president of investments at Gazit Group USA Inc., a real estate investor owned by a company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

                                                    Mr. Kropp was selected as one of our three independent directors because of his prior experience on several investment fund committees. We believe Mr. Kropp's direct experience with investments as a portfolio manager and registered investment advisor is valuable to our board of directors. He also has extensive accounting, auditing and finance expertise which, we believe, will be beneficial in providing leadership on the audit committee.
