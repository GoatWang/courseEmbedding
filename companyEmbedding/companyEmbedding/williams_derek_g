5.0 out of 5 starsfabulous feat of programmingByWillieon September 8, 2010OK, i can understand why some of the young whippersnappers here may not like this collection of pinball games... however, as someone who has played the original tables and who has purchased this same set for the PSP, PS2, and now the Wii, these games are not only amazing feats of programming, but in at least one of the games - Central Park to be specific - almost *exactly* re-creates the feel of the physical table: the ball movement, plunger, sound, bumper, scoring - and even the 'traps' and 'tricks'even more amazing is that this collection is nearly consistent in its cross-platform incarnations...i just wish there was an OS X or Linux version...reasonably priced, great game play, and true to the original... it doesn't get any better than that for me...

3.0 out of 5 starsComparing Gottlieb Pinball to Williams PinballByDerek Gon February 3, 2010The main reason why this game doesn't seem as fun as the Williams version of this game is just that for most people, especially the casual pinball player, Williams games were easier and just more fun to play.  Half of the Gottlieb games in this group, mostly older games, are a giant luckfest.  Pull the handle, watch the ball go down the outside pocket.  Insert another virtual quarter.  The other half of the games have some insane requirements like skill shots in certain a order only.  Very difficult.  Personally I avoided Gottlieb games when I was growing up and only bought this game to see if my advanced age would give me increased patience for them.  Nope!  Adjectives like 'historic' and 'classic' are used to describe these tables.  Classic in the way of an Edsel, maybe.One nice thing that Gottlieb has that Williams doesn't is the ability to switch from 3 to 5 balls.  I hated having only 3 balls available in Williams games since most merchants were generous enough to give us five balls a game.  Gottlieb fans will not be disappointed with this virtual recreation, though, especially the skill-shot games like "Big Shot" but I still don't understand why anyone would like it or "Central Park" unless they were serious players because they're are some of the toughest games to play.Another thing, someone complained about the way the ball looked.  I agree it's a dumb idea not to have the standard ball but I suppose the creators figured it was a bonus to be worked off.  Another new feature about this game is you can use the credits you've earned to buy special options like custom balls, turning the tilt on and off, etc.  Each special code could be purchased with 100 credit increments.  Unfortunately even the custom balls don't seem to include the reflective silver which is really disappointing.Finally, turning off table reflections is a must in the options so you can see what you're doing.  Also, the table views have changed.  Be aware the 1 button switches between smart cam and full view cam only, while the number 2 button switches between smart cam 1-4 or full table cam 1-4 if I recall correctly.  Whatever the case, camera views are different than the Williams game in that respect so be aware.** Spoiler alert **Enter the code 'CKF' in the codes section in 'Options' for custom balls.Enter the code 'BZZ' to turn on/off tilt so you'll be able to slam the tables around.The remaining codes simply unlock the various tables so they don't cost credits to play.  Of course you shouldn't need these codes as this you will also be able to unlock other tables once you meet the table goals of each game you play.  You should be able to do that, right?Hope the review helped.

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsComparing Gottlieb Pinball to Williams PinballByDerek GVINE VOICEon February 3, 2010Verified PurchaseThe main reason why this game doesn't seem as fun as the Williams version of this game is just that for most people, especially the casual pinball player, Williams games were easier and just more fun to play.  Half of the Gottlieb games in this group, mostly older games, are a giant luckfest.  Pull the handle, watch the ball go down the outside pocket.  Insert another virtual quarter.  The other half of the games have some insane requirements like skill shots in certain a order only.  Very difficult.  Personally I avoided Gottlieb games when I was growing up and only bought this game to see if my advanced age would give me increased patience for them.  Nope!  Adjectives like 'historic' and 'classic' are used to describe these tables.  Classic in the way of an Edsel, maybe.One nice thing that Gottlieb has that Williams doesn't is the ability to switch from 3 to 5 balls.  I hated having only 3 balls available in Williams games since most merchants were generous enough to give us five balls a game.  Gottlieb fans will not be disappointed with this virtual recreation, though, especially the skill-shot games like "Big Shot" but I still don't understand why anyone would like it or "Central Park" unless they were serious players because they're are some of the toughest games to play.Another thing, someone complained about the way the ball looked.  I agree it's a dumb idea not to have the standard ball but I suppose the creators figured it was a bonus to be worked off.  Another new feature about this game is you can use the credits you've earned to buy special options like custom balls, turning the tilt on and off, etc.  Each special code could be purchased with 100 credit increments.  Unfortunately even the custom balls don't seem to include the reflective silver which is really disappointing.Finally, turning off table reflections is a must in the options so you can see what you're doing.  Also, the table views have changed.  Be aware the 1 button switches between smart cam and full view cam only, while the number 2 button switches between smart cam 1-4 or full table cam 1-4 if I recall correctly.  Whatever the case, camera views are different than the Williams game in that respect so be aware.** Spoiler alert **Enter the code 'CKF' in the codes section in 'Options' for custom balls.Enter the code 'BZZ' to turn on/off tilt so you'll be able to slam the tables around.The remaining codes simply unlock the various tables so they don't cost credits to play.  Of course you shouldn't need these codes as this you will also be able to unlock other tables once you meet the table goals of each game you play.  You should be able to do that, right?Hope the review helped.0Comment|

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsSorry I read the other reviews before buying it - I would have purchased it sooner.ByJeffA2001on June 23, 2011Verified PurchaseI played pinball games growing up in the 1960's and 1970's, but never mastered them, I was a casual player.  I initially purchased the Williams Collection and avoided the Gottlieb Collection based on other people's reviews.  While I agree that the Williams Collection games are better graphically, the games on Gottlieb are more varied and as equally as much fun to play.  They include non-traditional pinball games such as bowling and a card game as well as other novelty devices found in arcades (Love Meter and Zoltan).  In addition, I liked the fact that some games required more than one credit per game making me appreciate the credits I earned as I had to decide which games to use my quarters on in my younger arcade days.  For under $20, this game is well worth it.  If you enjoy pinball, I recommend getting both Williams and Gottlieb.0Comment|

It's Great!ByFloydTheBarberon February 11, 2017Verified PurchaseI'm not sure why this game get killed in comparison to the Williams Collection, but owning both I can tell you this game is every bit as worthy; maybe better.  There are classic old school games like Genie and Big Shot as well as faster, more modern games like Victory, Black Hole and the never released Goin' Nuts.  80 percent of these games are challengiong and endless fun.Don't let the detractors have the last word.  If you love pinball you'll love this collection.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGreat for the pinball junkie, but does not compare to Williams CollectionByAmazonianon January 22, 2010Verified PurchaseI am a pinball junkie, so when I purchased the Pinball Hall of Fame Williams collection I was in heaven. Truly that game was as close as I'll probably ever get to owning my own room of favorite pinball machines (and the replay value is never-ending). So of course I was thrilled to see that Gottlieb was headed our way. As a couple of years have passed since the Williams release I thought that there was a chance that the game might even rise above my long time fave. I'm sad to say that I was wrong. Even though we are fortunate enough to have those same awesome controls on the Wii that make you feel you are actually playing pinball, there are some issues that can get in the way. I know other reviewers have pointed this out, but the graphics do not seem to be as clear as they were in the Williams collection. I really notice this on El Derado (I believe) where the backdrop is green/ representing the jungle. Truly there are times when it is difficult to make out the graphics (that is with or without table reflection on ).  I'm sure others are going to enjoy this arcades added features of a "love meter" and "fortune teller", but personally I would have rather had another great table to choose from. Another minor thing is that the William's arcade, has that great background noise/ music that you can control that gives the player that overall arcade experience feel. That feature is still here, but it is not as prevalent.  One of the draws for those interested in the history of pinball is that there are several older tables. One is called Playboy, and focuses on different card games/ basically dropping a ball in a whole/ no bumpers/flippers etc. Personally I do not see myself spending time playing this game. Another draw for those pinball history buffs is an option to tour the Gottlieb factory. That was not something that I enjoyed, but I could see how the pinball lover might.  There are a few fun games, but still for me they just don't compare to those in the Williams collection. The plain and simple reason for this is that these were not games from my past (outside of Blackhole). Really there is more of a nostalgic feel from the Williams collection due to that reason. That being said, as a pinball lover I absolutely feel that I got much more than a bargain for this game. I know that I will be keeping this in my permanent collection (solid replay value), but it just won't be used as much as Williams Hall of Fame. For those of you who are expecting a greater pinball experience/improvement on Williams I think you just may be disappointed. Still, for the money,replay value and life like experience, it is a worth the $[...]. If and when they release a Bally's Pinball Hall of Fame I will pounce at the chance.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA great old-fashioned pinball collectionByRyan Leonardon October 15, 2010Verified PurchaseThe Gottlieb Collection is always compared to the Williams Collection, and has the reputation of being the lesser game. Not true at all. Here's the deal: the Gottlieb Collection is actually an updated version of the pinball hall of fame that was released for the PS2 and Gamecube a couple years prior to the Williams Collection. As such, it does look a bit dated compared to the newer game. Also, the Gottlieb pinball machines themselves are mostly older mechanical designs from the 50's and 60's, compared to the electronic higher-tech Williams machines that are from the 70's and 80's. The Gottlieb machines are very faithful reproductions of those older tables so their gameplay is usually less complex than the more modern Williams tables. The bottom line is that The Gottlieb Collection is a great set of classic pinball tables and the gameplay is spot-on. I have enjoyed playing everything this collection has to offer and a couple of the machines offer a challenge you just cannot find on the more modern tables. I keep going back for more even after beating the challenges and goals just to see if I can beat my high score. There are some great tables here, so if you're a real fan of classic pinball you should pick this up.0Comment|

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsFUN AND NOSTALGIA  FOR A GOOD PRICEByRick K.on March 7, 2010Verified PurchaseFor those of us old enough to remember the pinball era, this is a fun and nostalgic game.  For those who are too young to remember, it's a great new experience of a bygone time.  The pinball games are recreations of the old Gottlieb games, from the mid to late 1900s, and they are very true to form.  They even recreate the "quirks" in each pinball game as I recollect.  The ability to play old pinball games, with my hands in the right "flipper" positions; and to be able to "shake the machine" as you would in real play, is great fun.  It's realistic enough that I sometimes forget that I'm playing an electronic game on a TV screen.  Yes, there are a few quirks, but they are relatively minor and do not impact the fun factor:  The graphics could be better, and a slight step down from Wii's Williams Pinball.  Unless I missed something, I have to push the remote buttons while the ball is in play in order to change from the "Smart" camera modes (which follow the ball) to "Full View" modes.  And some of the pinball games they selected (like Xolten, Playboy, and Stars n Stripes) are relatively lame.  But there are enough good pinball games in the package to provide for many hours of good entertainment.Playing pinball from the comfort of your lounge chair:  awesome!To be wisked back 50 years to a bygone era:  pricelessAnd all for a measly (...).  I cant wait for the next round of Wii Hall of Fame pinball games (Bally, are you listening???)0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsGottlieb Is KingByBandacheon January 14, 2011Verified PurchaseFor those of us who were growing up in the 60's and 70's pinball was an integral part of life.  Pinball arcades were everywhere, especially in midwest states such as Michigan.  The folks at Crave have done a really nice job of recreating some of those classic machines with this game along with some of the more recent Gottlieb titles.  They give a nice acknowledgement to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas too.  For diehard pinheads, this is a must see destination.  I've been there and can tell you they have an incredible collection that is well maintained and all available for play.  Back to the video game.  It is realistic, fun and challenging.  The only knock against it is I wish they had more wedgehead machines - such as Kings and Queens, or Jungle Queen, or the original El Dorado (they have the digital remake - which is still cool and fun).  All in all - this is a great video game.  I hope they go for a Gottlieb #2 - since there are so many more titles they could include - and it is a great way to preserve pinball if you can't afford to go to Las Vegas!0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsPinball HeavenByburkeon January 29, 2010Verified PurchaseI haven't played a real pinball machine for many many years and I remember when all pinball games were 5 cents for five balls.  When I saw that a decent pinball game was available for the Wii (which was purchased primarily for my grand children) I couldn't resist buying the Williams collection.  Wow, back to the old days but with no need for those hard earned or often stolen nickels.  I just purchased the Gottlieb collection a few days ago and actually prefer it to the Williams collection.  In short most of the games are easier to beat and being able to play all the tables with five balls really appeals to me.  I don't feel that the graphics are really all that great on either the Williams or the Gottlieb collection but that may be due more to the somewhat lesser graphics capability of the Wii versus other game consoles.  I highly reccommend either collection for anyone with even a casual interest in pinball.  For what it's worth, cheat codes for the Wii Gottlieb collection are available on [...]. I haven't tried these as yet so they may only work for the UK version of the Wii Gottlieb collection.11 comment|

Pattersonon March 22, 2010Verified PurchaseIf you are a pinball fan, the Wii "Hall of Fame" collections can't be beat.  The biggest difference between Wii and other video systems' pinball games is the "nudge" feature - you can use the Wii controllers to nudge the machine, just like a regular machine, and influence the movement of the ball. You can also tilt the machine if you're not careful.The Gottlieb Collection, like the Williams Collection before it, faithfully recreates the look of the machines and gives information on the history of each machine and instructions on how to maximize your score.  The Gottlieb Collection also features some fun and goofy old-time arcade machines, including the Love Meter and the Fortune Teller.That being said, the Gottlieb Collection is not as much fun as the Williams Collection simply because the Gottlieb machines themselves are not as much fun, at least for me.  Some of these machines are really old - from the '50s and '60s - and don't have as many bells and whistles (literally)as the machines created in the '80s and '90s.  A couple of the games are great - Black Hole is my favorite.  Most of the featured machines have multiple flippers, a couple have multiple levels, but many are of the type and era of "Jive Time" on the Williams Collection (although even Jive Time has a cool Wheel of Fortune feature).  Play on these old machines can be a little slow as there's basically only targets and bumpers, and with some it's quite difficult to keep the ball in play for extended periods.I think if you are a fan of arcade pinball, this is a good game to add to your collection.  If have limited experience with arcade machines, the Williams Collection might be the better one to start with.  But either way, the Wii "Collection" series are far superior to most electronic pinball games.0Comment|
