We refer to this strategy as “value add” or the “Hartman Advantage.

CONSIDER THESE RISK FACTORS BEFORE INVESTING
The offering is being made by means of a Prospectus only to qualified investors who meet minimum suitability requirements, as well as standards determined by your financial advisor. This material must be preceded or accompanied by the Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (“Hartman XX” or the “REIT”) Prospectus. Please read the Prospectus in its entirety, before investing, for complete information and to learn more about the risks associated with this offering such as:

Hartman XX is a “blind pool,” as it has not identified all of the properties it intends to purchase, and it has a limited operating history.
This investment has limited liquidity. There is no guarantee of a liquidity event. No public market exists for this non-traded REIT, and one may never exist, for the shares of our common stock. There is also the possibility that even if investors were able to sell their shares, they may have to sell them at a substantial discount.
Investors should have an expected investment time horizon in excess of five years.
There is no guarantee that investors will receive or continue to receive distributions. Distributions have been paid from the proceeds of the offering, and may be derived from borrowings, or from the sale of assets, and Hartman XX has no limits on the amounts it may pay from such other sources. Distributions have come from the offering proceeds and paid in excess of earnings. Distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations may decrease or diminish an investor’s interest.
Conflicts of interest between Hartman XX and its advisor and its affiliates, including payments by the REIT of significant fees to the advisor and its affiliates, some of which are payable based upon factors other than the quality of services provided to us. These fees could influence our advisor’s advice to us as well as the judgment of affiliates to our advisor performing service to us.
Economic factors affecting the commercial real estate markets generally, including changes in the economy, tenant turnover, interest rates, of mortgage funds, operating expenses, cost of insurance and each tenant’s ability to continue to pay rent.
No connection between the share price of the REIT and the net asset value of the REIT until such time as the assets are valued the Board of Directors.
If Hartman XX fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to federal income tax. Cash available for distributions could decrease materially and adversely affect the return on your investment.
Leverage (debt) is borrowed money. It is often used to supplement or enhance the total return on an investment However, it is also recognized that leverage, when used excessively, can have a significant negative impact on theperformance of an investment. Leverage risks may include an inability to pay off the interest from the cash flow from the property. Rates on loans can adjust to higher levels, and there’s potential for default on loans. In an effort to maximize the performance of a REIT portfolio, a number of factors are considered in evaluating financing options. Some of the more common factors include cost of capital, fixed versus variable debt, loan-to-value and debt coverage ratio.

The names, logos and all related product and service names, design marks and slogans are the trademarks or service marks of their respective companies.
Hartman Income REIT is the sponsor of Hartman XX. Hartman Advisors LLC is the Company’s advisor.
This material contains forward-looking statements to the business and financial outlook of Hartman XX and its advisor that are based management’s current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these statements, and you should not undue reliance on any such statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ from the statements contained in this material. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements were made and we undertake no obligation to update any such statements that may become untrue as a result of subsequent events.

Hartman XX Supplement No 7 to Prospectus dated March 30, 2015
 
CONSIDER THESE RISK FACTORS BEFORE INVESTING
THIS IS NEITHER AN OFFER TO SELL NOR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN. AN OFFERING IS MADE ONLY BY PROSPECTUS. THIS LITERATURE MUST BE PRECEDED OR ACCOMPANIED BY A CURRENT HARTMAN SHORT TERM INCOME PROPERTIES XX, INC. PROSPECTUS. AS SUCH, A COPY OF THE CURRENT PROSPECTUS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING AND SHOULD BE READ IN ORDER TO MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND RISKS OF THE OFFERING OF SECURITIES TO WHICH IT RELATES. NON-TRADED REIT INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ALL INVESTORS.
INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTING IN A SPECIFIC NON-TRADED REIT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PROSPECTUS, WHICH SHOULD BE READ PRIOR TO INVESTING.
No offering is made except by a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Neither the SEC nor any other state or federal regulator has passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering or these securities or confirmed the adequacy or accuracy of the prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the current prospectus. The achievement of any goals is not guaranteed.
All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the current prospectus. Investors should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The achievement of any goals is not guaranteed. For more complete information about investing in HSTIPXX, including risks, charges and expenses, refer to our prospectus. Securities offered through D.H. Hill Securities, LLLP, Member FINRA / SIPC, 1543 Green Oak Place, Ste. 100, Kingwood, TX 77339. (832) 644-1852.
Please read the prospectus in its entirety, before investing, for complete information and to learn more about the risks associated with this offering such as:

We commenced operations on December 28, 2010, have a limited operating history and have experienced losses in the past and may experience losses in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve our investment objectives.
The amount of distributions we may pay, if any, is uncertain. Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate, there is no guarantee of any return on your investment in our shares, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.
There is currently no public market for our common shares and therefore, it likely will be difficult for you to sell your shares, and if you are able to sell your shares, you will likely sell them at a substantial discount.
There are restrictions and limitations on your ability to have all or any portion of your shares redeemed under our share redemption program, and if you are able to have your shares repurchased pursuant to our share redemption program, it may be for a price less than the price you paid for the shares and the then current value of the shares.
The offering price of our shares of common stock for this offering was not determined on an independent basis and bears no relationship to the book or net value of our assets or to our expected operating income.
We have made a limited number of investments and other than investments and prospective investments disclosed in this prospectus, we have not identified any specific assets to acquire or investments to make with the proceeds of this offering. As a result, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments, aside from our limited number of existing investments, prior to your investment.
We rely on Hartman Advisors, LLC and its affiliates for our day-to-day operations and the selection of real estate investments. We pay substantial fees to these affiliates for these services. These affiliates are subject to conflicts of interest as a result of this and other relationships they have with us and other programs sponsored by our sponsor. We also compete with affiliates of our sponsor for tenants and investment opportunities, and some of those affiliates will have priority with respect to specified investment opportunities.
To date, distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and may be paid from offering proceeds or other sources other than cash from operations, such as borrowings, in the future. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds from this offering that we may use to fund distributions. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may represent a return of capital to you, which will lower your tax basis in our shares.
This is a “best efforts” offering and if we are unable to raise substantial funds then we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make.
We have made and may continue to make distributions in excess of our earnings and cash generated by operations. Distributions in excess of earnings and or cash generated by operations reduces the amount of capital available for investment in real property.
We are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real property.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of loss on our investments.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, it would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and may have adverse tax consequences to our stockholders.

Houston, TX (PRWEB)
December 05, 2016
 The escrow break occurred on December 1, 2016, and the initial public offering investors have been admitted as shareholders effective as of that date.  The Company’s Board of Directors has declared an initial annualized distribution rate of 7.5 percent to common shareholders of record, which is comprised of a 5.5 percent cash distribution and a 2 percent stock distribution, based upon a $10 per share purchase price.
The vREIT XXI Board of Directors established and authorized this initial distribution to be paid to common shareholders of record as of December 31, 2016. The initial distribution will be paid on or about January 20, 2017. 
Additionally, vREIT XXI, in a joint venture with Hartman Short Term Income Properties, XX, Inc., purchased Village Pointe Shopping Center (“Village Pointe” or the “Property”) in San Antonio, TX on November 14, 2016 for $7,050,000.  Village Pointe is a 54,246 square foot shopping center located just off US Highway 281 between Brook Hollow Boulevard and Thousand Oaks in San Antonio.  Built in 1982 and renovated in 2015, Village Pointe has impressive infill demographics that include a population of nearly 233,000 and an average household income of approximately $93,000, both within a five-mile radius.

Village Pointe boasts superior visibility with over 500 feet of highway frontage, a large monument sign, and a daily vehicle count of approximately 168,000 along US Highway 281. With proceeds from the escrow break, vREIT XXI will increase its investment in the joint venture to $1,350,000, or approximately 35.76% of joint venture equity, and intends to expand its ownership as new subscription dollars become available.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
1 —
Organization

 

Hartman
vREIT XXI, Inc. (the “
Company
”
) was
formed on September 3, 2015 as a Maryland corporation and intends
to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( “
REIT
”
). 
The Company expects to use the proceeds from its initial public
offering to invest in a portfolio of commercial real estate
properties that offer a blend of current and potential income based
on in place occupancy plus relatively significant potential for
growth in income and value from re-tenanting, repositioning or
redevelopment.  As discussed in Note 3, the Company was
initially capitalized by the sale of 22,100 shares of common stock,
at an issue price of $9.05 per share, to Hartman Advisors, LLC, an
affiliate of the Company ’
s Sponsor
(as defined below) on September 30, 2015.  The Company
’
s fiscal
year end is December 31.  The Company has not yet begun
operations and therefore has not presented a consolidated statement
of operations.

 

Effective
June 24, 2016, the Company commenced its initial public offering
(the “
Offering
”
) of up to
a maximum of $250,000,000 in shares of its common stock to the
public in its primary offering at $10.00 per share, with discounts
available to certain purchasers, and up to $19,000,000 in shares of
its common stock to its stockholders pursuant to its distribution
reinvestment plan (the “
DRP
”
) at $9.50
per share.  The Company may reallocate the shares between the
primary offering and the DRP at its discretion.  In addition,
the Company ’
s board of
directors may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, change
the price at which the Company offers shares to the public or to
its stockholders pursuant to the DRP to reflect changes in the
Company ’
s
estimated value per share and other factors that the Company
’
s board of
directors deems relevant.

 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Offering, subscription proceeds are held in an
escrow account until the Company raises the minimum offering amount
of $1,000,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not raised
the minimum offering amount and the subscription proceeds held in
escrow had not been released to the Company.

 

The
Company ’
s advisor
is Hartman XXI Advisors, LLC (the “
Advisor
”
), a Texas
limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman
Advisors, LLC.  Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc., an
affiliate of the Advisor, is the Company ’
s sponsor
( “
Sponsor
”
).
 Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor
is responsible for managing the Company ’
s affairs
on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions
and investments on behalf of the Company.

 

Substantially
all of the Company ’
s business
will be conducted through Hartman vREIT XXI Operating Partnership,
L.P., a Texas limited partnership (the “
OP
”
).
 The Company is the sole general partner of the OP. The
initial limited partners of the OP are Hartman vREIT XXI Holdings
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( “
XXI
Holdings ”
), and
Hartman vREIT XXI SLP LLC ( “
SLP
LLC ”
), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Hartman Advisors, LLC SLP LLC has
invested $1,000 in the OP in exchange for a separate class of
limited partnership interests (the “
Special
Limited Partnership Interests ”
).
 As the Company accepts subscriptions for shares, it will
transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the Offering to
the OP as a capital contribution. The partnership agreement
provides that the OP will be operated in a manner that will enable
the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as
a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax
liability and (3) ensure that the OP will not be classified as
a “
publicly
traded partnership ”
for
purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “
Internal
Revenue Code ”
), which
classification could result in the OP being taxed as a corporation,
rather than as a partnership.  In addition to the
administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by the OP
in acquiring and operating real properties, the OP will pay all of
the Company ’
s
administrative costs and expenses and such expenses will be treated
as expenses of the OP.

 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this
report are unaudited; however, amounts presented in the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 are derived from
the Company ’
s
audited

HARTMAN
vREIT XXI, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

 

consolidated
balance sheet as of that date. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared by the
Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ( “
GAAP
”
) and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, on a
consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements presented
herein reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals and adjustments), which are in the opinion of management,
necessary to fairly present the financial position of the Company
as of September 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the
period from inception, September 3, 2015 to September 30,
2015.

 

The
Company ’
s
consolidated financial statements include the Company
’
s
accounts and the accounts of OP and XXI Holdings, the subsidiaries
over which the Company has control.  All intercompany balances
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

 

Organization
and Offering Costs

 

Organization
and offering costs of the Company are incurred by Advisor on behalf
of the Company and, accordingly, are not a direct liability of the
Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and are not recorded in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Such costs will include legal, accounting, printing
and other offering expenses, including marketing, salaries and
direct expenses of the Advisor ’
s
employees and employees of the Advisor ’
s
affiliates and others. Under the terms of the advisory agreement
between the Company and the Advisor, upon the satisfaction of the
minimum offering amount and the release to the Company of all
subscription proceeds held in escrow, the Company will be obligated
to reimburse the Advisor for organization and offering costs
incurred by Advisor in connection with the Offering.  In the
event that the minimum offering amount is not achieved within one
year of the date of the commencement of the Offering, the Offering
will terminate and the Company will have no obligation to reimburse
Advisor for organization and offering costs incurred by the Advisor
on behalf of the Company. The Advisor has incurred organization and
offering costs of $460,312 and $222,685 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Advisor will not be
reimbursed for organization and offering costs to the extent that
such reimbursement would cause the total organizational and
offering costs incurred by the Company (including selling
commissions, dealer manager fees and all other underwriting
compensation) to exceed 15% of the aggregate gross proceeds from
the sale of the shares of common stock sold in the Offering. Any
such reimbursement will not exceed the actual costs and expenses
incurred by Advisor.  When recorded by the Company,
organization costs will be expensed as incurred, and offering
costs, which include selling commissions, dealer manager fees and
all other underwriting compensation, will be deferred and charged
to stockholder ’
s equity
as such amounts are reimbursed or paid to the Advisor, the dealer
manager or their affiliates from the gross proceeds of the
Offering.

  

Financial
Instruments

The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following
financial instrument: cash and cash equivalents.  The Company
considers the carrying value to approximate the fair value of these
financial instruments based on the short duration between
origination of the instruments and their expected realization.
 

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company intends to make an election to be taxed as a REIT under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing
in the taxable year in which the Company raises the minimum
offering amount in the Offering.  If the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to
federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT
taxable income to its stockholders, so long as it distributes at
least 90 percent of its REIT taxable income (which is computed
without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain
and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in
accordance with GAAP.  REITs are subject to a number of other
organizational and operational requirements.  Even if the
Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to
certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and
federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income.

OP has issued the Advisor a separate, special limited partnership
interest, in the form of Special Limited Partnership Interests.
 See Note 6 ( “
Special
Limited Partnership Interest ”
)
below. 

 

The
Advisor will receive reimbursement for organizational and offering
expenses incurred on the Company ’
s behalf,
but only to the extent that such reimbursements do not exceed
actual expenses incurred by the Advisor and would not cause the
cumulative sales commission, the dealer manager fee and other
organization and offering expenses borne by the Company to exceed
15.0% of gross offering proceeds from the sale of shares in the
Offering.

 

The
Advisor, or its affiliates, will receive an acquisition fee equal
to 2.5% of the cost of each investment the Company acquires, which
includes the amount actually paid or allocated to fund the
purchase, development, construction or improvement of each
investment, including acquisition expenses and any debt
attributable to each investment.

 

The
Advisor, or its affiliates, will receive a debt financing fee equal
to 1.0% of the amount available under any loan or line of credit
originated or assumed, directly or indirectly, in connection with
the acquisition, development, construction, improvement of
properties or other permitted investments, which will be in
addition to the acquisition fee paid to the Advisor.

 

The
Company will pay Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc. (
“
HIRM
”
), an
affiliate of the Advisor, property management fees equal to (i) 5%
of the effective gross revenues of the managed properties for the
management of retail centers, warehouse, industrial and flex
properties and (ii) 3% or 4% of the effective gross revenues for
office buildings, as applicable based upon the square footage and
gross property revenues of the office buildings.  The Company
also expects to pay HIRM leasing fees in an amount equal to the
leasing fees charged by unaffiliated persons rendering comparable
services in the same geographic location of the applicable
property, provided that such fees will only be paid if a majority
of the Company ’
s board of
directors, including a majority of its independent directors,
determines that such fees are fair and reasonable in relation to
the services being performed.  HIRM may subcontract the
performance of its property management and leasing duties to third
parties and HIRM will pay a portion of its property management fee
to the third parties with whom it subcontracts for these
services.  The Company will reimburse the costs and
expenses incurred by HIRM on the Company ’
s behalf,
including the wages and salaries and other employee-related
expenses of all employees of HIRM or its subcontractors who are
engaged in the operation, management, maintenance or access control
of our properties, including taxes, insurance and benefits relating
to such employees, and travel and other out-of-pocket expenses
that are directly related to the management of specific

properties.  Other
charges, including fees and expenses of third-party professionals
and consultants, will be reimbursed, subject to the limitations on
fees and reimbursements contained in the Charter.

 

If HIRM
provides construction management services related to the
improvement or finishing of tenant space in the Company
’
s real
estate properties, the Company will pay HIRM a construction
management fee in an amount that is usual and customary for
comparable services rendered to similar projects in the geographic
market of the project; provided, however, that the Company will
only pay a construction management fee if a majority of the
Company ’
s board of
directors, including a majority of its independent directors,
determines that such construction management fee is fair and
reasonable and on terms and conditions not less favorable than
those available from unaffiliated third parties.

 

The
Company will pay the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal
to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the higher of (i) the cost or (ii) the
value of all real estate investments the Company
acquires.

 

If Advisor
or affiliate provides a substantial amount of services, as
determined by the Company ’
s
independent directors, in connection with the sale of one or more
assets, the Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee equal to
(1) in the case of the sale of real property, the lesser of: (A)
one-half of the aggregate brokerage commission paid (including the
disposition fee) or, if none is paid, the amount that customarily
would be paid, or (B) 3% of the sales price of each property sold,
and (2) in the case of the sale of any asset other than real
property, 3% of the sales price of such asset.

 

The
Company will reimburse the Advisor for all expenses paid or
incurred by the Advisor in connection with the services provided to
the Company, subject to the limitation that, commencing four fiscal
quarters after the Company ’
s
acquisition of its first asset, the Company will not reimburse the
Advisor for any amount by which its operating expenses (including
the asset management fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal
quarters exceeds the greater of:  (1) 2% of the Company
’
s average
invested assets (as defined in the Charter), or (2) 25% of the
Company ’
s net
income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves
for depreciation, bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and
excluding any gain from the sale of the Company ’
s assets
for that period.  Notwithstanding the above, the Company may
reimburse the Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if
a majority of the Company ’
s
independent directors determines that such excess expenses are
justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.

Incentive
Plans

 

The
Company has adopted a long-term incentive plan (the
“
Incentive
Award Plan ”
) that
provides for the grant of equity awards to employees, directors and
consultants and those of the Company ’
s
affiliates. The Incentive Award Plan authorizes the granting of
restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted or deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, other
stock-based awards and cash-based awards to directors, officers,
employees and consultants of the Company and the Company
’
s
affiliates ’
selected
by the board of directors for participation in the Incentive Award
Plan. Stock options and shares of restricted common stock granted
under the Incentive Award Plan will not, in the aggregate, exceed
an amount equal to 5.0% of the outstanding shares of the
Company ’
s common
stock on the date of grant or award of any such stock options or
shares of restricted stock. Stock options may not have an exercise
price that is less than the fair market value of a share of the
Company ’
s common
stock on the date of grant.  Shares of common stock will be
authorized and reserved for issuance under the Incentive Award
Plan. The Company has adopted an independent directors
’
compensation
plan (the “
Independent
Directors Compensation Plan ”
) pursuant
to which each of the Company ’
s
independent directors will be entitled, subject to the plan
’
s
conditions and restrictions, to receive an initial grant of 3,000
shares of restricted stock when the Company raises the minimum
offering amount of $1,000,000 in the Offering.  Each new
independent director that subsequently joins the Company
’
s board of
directors will receive a grant of 3,000 shares of restricted stock
upon his or her election to the Company ’
s board of
directors. The shares of restricted common stock granted to
independent directors fully vest upon the completion of the annual
term for which the director was elected.  Subject to certain
conditions, the non-vested shares of restricted stock granted
pursuant to the Independent Directors Compensation Plan will become
fully vested on the earlier to occur of (1) the termination of
the independent director ’
s service
as a director due to his or her death or disability, or (2) a
change in control of the Company.  No awards have been granted
under either the Incentive Award Plan or the Independent Directors
Compensation Plan as of September 30, 2016.

Special
Limited Partnership Interest

 

Pursuant
to the limited partnership agreement for the OP, SLP LLC, the
holder of the Special Limited Partnership Interest, will be
entitled to receive distributions equal to 15.0% of the OP
’
s net
sales proceeds from the disposition of assets, but only after the
Company ’
s
stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative
distributions equal to their total invested capital plus a 6.0%
cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such aggregated
invested capital. In addition, the holder or the Special Limited
Partnership Interest is entitled to receive a payment upon the
redemption of the Special Limited Partnership Interests. Pursuant
to the limited partnership agreement for the OP, the Special
Limited Partnership Interests will be redeemed upon: (1) the
listing of the Company ’
s common
stock on a national securities exchange; (2) the occurrence of
certain events that result in the termination or non-renewal of the
Company ’
s advisory
agreement with the Advisor ( “
Advisory
Agreement ”
) other
than by the Company for “
cause
”
(as
defined in the Advisory Agreement); or (3) the termination of the
Advisory Agreement by the Company for cause. In the event of the
listing of the Company ’
s shares
of common stock or a termination of the Advisory Agreement other
than by the Company for cause, the Special Limited Partnership
Interests will be redeemed for an aggregate amount equal to the
amount that the holder of the Special Limited Partnership Interests
would have been entitled to receive, as described above, if the OP
had disposed of all of its assets at their fair market value and
all liabilities of the OP had been satisfied in full according to
their terms as of the date of the event triggering the redemption.
Payment of the redemption price to the holder of the Special
Limited Partnership Interests will be paid, at the holder
’
s
discretion, in the form of (i) limited partnership interests in the
OP, (ii) shares of the Company ’
s common
stock, or (iii) a non-interest bearing promissory note. If the
event triggering the redemption is a listing of the Company
’
s shares
on a national securities exchange only, the fair market value of
the assets of the OP will be calculated taking into account the
average share price of the Company ’
s shares
for a specified period. If the event triggering the redemption is
an underwritten public offering of the Company ’
s shares,
the fair market value will take into account the valuation of the
shares as determined by the initial public offering price in such
offering. If the triggering event of the redemption is the
termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement other than by
the Company for cause for any other reason, the fair market value
of the assets of the OP will be calculated based on an appraisal or
valuation of the Company ’
s assets.
In the event of the termination or non-renewal of the Advisory
Agreement by the Company for cause, all of the Special Limited
Partnership Interests will be redeemed by the OP for the aggregate
price of $1.

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

         This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements,
including discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
other matters, which are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but are
the intent, belief or current expectations of our management based
on its knowledge and understanding of our business and industry.
Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of
terms such as “
may,
”
“
will,
”
“
should,
”
“
potential,
”
“
predicts,
”
“
anticipates,

“
expects,

”
“

“

“
estimates
”
or the
negative of such terms and variations of these words and similar
expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to
predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking
statements.

 

          Forward-looking
statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to
be incorrect or false. You are cautioned to not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our
management ’
s view
only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We
undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking
statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of
unanticipated events or changes to future operating results.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q include:

 

·

our
ability to raise capital in our ongoing public offering;

·

our
ability to effectively deploy the proceeds raised in our public
offering;

·

our
ability to identify and acquire real estate and real estate-related
assets on terms that are favorable to us;

·

the
imposition of federal taxes if we fail to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year or forego an opportunity to ensure REIT
status;

·

uncertainties
related to the national economy, the real estate industry in
general and in our specific markets;

·

legislative
or regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing
REITs;

·

construction
costs that may exceed estimates or construction delays;

·

increases
in interest rates;

·

availability
of credit or significant disruption in the credit
markets;

·

litigation
risks;

·

risks
inherent to the real estate business, including tenant defaults,
potential liability related to environmental matters and the lack
of liquidity of real estate investments;

·

inability
to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases at our
properties;

·

inability
to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions,
competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax or other applicable
laws;

·

the
potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital
expenditures out of operating cash flow;

·

the fact
that we pay fees and expenses to our advisor and its affiliates
that were not negotiated on an arm ’
s length
basis and the fact that the payment of these fees and expenses
increases the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on
their investment in us;

·

our
ability to generate sufficient cash flows to pay distributions to
our stockholders;

·

our
ability to retain our executive officers and other key personnel of
our advisor and other affiliates of our advisor; and

·

changes to
generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

 

Any of the
assumptions underlying forward-looking statements could be
inaccurate. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk that actual
results will

events, changed circumstances or any other reason. In light of the

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.
