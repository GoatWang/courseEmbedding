	Risk Factors







	 







	Please see the Preliminary Offering Documents for a description of certain risks related to this investment, including, but not
	limited to, the following:




	 





	 









	 




	




	 





	Depending on the performance of the Market Measure as measured shortly before the maturity date, your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed
	return of principal.









	 




	




	 





	Payments on the notes, including repayment of principal, are subject to the credit risk of SEK. If SEK becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its obligations, you
	may lose your entire investment.









	 




	




	 





	Your investment return, if any, is limited to the return represented by the Capped Value and may be less than a comparable investment directly in the stocks
	included in the Market Measure.









	 




	




	 





	The initial estimated value of the notes on the pricing date will be less than their public offering price.









	 




	




	 





	If you attempt to sell the notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than both the public offering price and the initial estimated value of the
	notes on the pricing date.









	 




	




	 





	You will have no rights of a holder of the securities represented by the Market Measure, and you will not be entitled to receive securities or dividends or other
	distributions by the issuers of those securities.









	 




	




	 





	Your return on the notes and the value of the notes may be affected by exchange rate movements and factors affecting the international securities markets.








	Final terms will be set on the pricing date within the given range for the specified Market-Linked Investment. Please see the
	Preliminary Offering Documents for complete product disclosure, including related risks and tax disclosure.

	Summary




	The Accelerated Return Notes


	®


	Linked to the Copper Spot Price Due March 14, 2012
	(the Notes) are senior, unsecured debt securities of Aktiebolaget Svensk Exportkredit (Publ) (Swedish Export Credit Corporation). The Notes are not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or
	secured by collateral.

	The Notes will rank equally with all of SEKs other unsecured and unsubordinated debt, and any payments due on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, will be subject to the credit risk of SEK.

	The Notes
	provide a leveraged return for investors, subject to a cap, if the Copper Spot Price (as defined below) increases moderately from the Starting Value, determined on January 19, 2011, the date the Notes were priced for initial sale to the public
	(the Pricing Date), to the Ending Value, determined on a Calculation Day shortly prior to the maturity date of the Notes. Investors must be willing to forgo interest payments on the Notes and be willing to accept a return that is capped
	or a repayment that is less, and potentially significantly less, than the Original Offering Price of the Notes.




	Capitalized terms used but not defined
	in this term sheet have the meaning set forth in product supplement ARN-3. References in this term sheet to SEK, we, us, and our are to Aktiebolaget Svensk Exportkredit (Publ) (Swedish Export Credit
	Corporation), and references to Merrill Lynch are to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.

	The London Metal Exchange second ring official reference price for cash settled Copper Grade A contracts determined at approximately 12:35 p.m.
	London time (the Copper Spot Price), which is a benchmark price for copper used in markets where copper is sold by a cash seller and settled in United States dollars (Bloomberg symbol: LOCADY).







	Starting Value:





	 




	9,788.00







	Ending Value:





	 




	The Copper Spot Price on the scheduled Calculation Day (as defined below). If it is determined that the scheduled Calculation Day is not a Market

	returns on the Notes, including
	the Capped Value of $13.21 (a 32.10% return). The green line reflects the

	Risk Factors





	There are important differences between the Notes and a conventional debt security. An investment in the Notes involves significant risks, including those listed below. You should carefully review the more
	detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the Additional Risk Factors section below, the Risk Factors section beginning on page P-4 of the product supplement and the Risks Associated with Foreign
	Currency Notes and Indexed Notes section beginning on page S-4 of the prospectus supplement identified below under Additional Note Terms, as well as the explanation of certain risks related to SEK contained in Item 3 of our
	Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on April 1, 2010 and is incorporated by reference herein. We also urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other
	advisers before you invest in the Notes.




	 





	 






	§








	 





	Your investment may result in a loss.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Your yield may be lower than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Your return, if any, is limited to the return represented by the Capped Value.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Your investment return, if any, may be less than a comparable investment directly in copper, as measured by the Copper Spot Price.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment linked to the Copper Spot Price.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	In seeking to provide you with what we believe to be commercially reasonable terms for the Notes while providing Merrill Lynch with compensation for its
	services, we have considered the costs of developing, hedging and distributing the Notes. If a trading market develops for the Notes (and such a market may not develop), these costs are expected to affect the market price you may receive or be
	quoted for your Notes on a date prior to the stated maturity date. Merrill Lynch is not obligated to make a market for, or to repurchase, the Notes.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Many factors affect the trading value of the Notes; these factors interrelate in complex ways and the effect of any one factor may offset or magnify the effect
	of another factor.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Payments on the Notes are subject to SEKs credit risk, and changes to SEKs credit ratings are expected to affect the value of the Notes.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Purchases and sales by Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may affect your return.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Ownership of Notes will not entitle you to any rights with respect to copper or any related futures contracts or commodities.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Trading in copper can be volatile based on a number of factors that we cannot control.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Suspensions or disruptions of market trading in copper and related futures markets may adversely affect the value of the Notes.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	The Notes will not be regulated by the CFTC.






	 





	 






	§








	 





	Tax consequences are uncertain. See Summary Tax Consequences and Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations below and
	Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations beginning on page P-18 of product supplement ARN-3.







	In addition to
	these risk factors, it is important to bear in mind that the Notes are senior debt securities of SEK and are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC or secured by collateral, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, the Kingdom of Sweden. The
	Notes will rank equally with all of SEKs unsecured and unsubordinated debt, and any payments due on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, will be subject to the credit risk of SEK.







	Additional Risk Factors





	There are risks
	associated with investing in copper or copper-linked Notes.





	The Copper Spot Price is derived from an exchange-traded principals market,
	specifically the London Metal Exchange (the LME). Certain features of U.S. futures markets are not present in the context of trading on the LME. For example, there are no daily price limits, which would otherwise restrict the extent of
	daily fluctuations in the prices of the commodities in such markets. In a declining market, therefore, it is possible that prices would continue to decline without limitation within a trading day or over a period of trading days.




	Copper prices are primarily responsive to global supply and demand. Key factors that may influence prices are the size and availability of copper stockpiles, as
	well as economic conditions in the countries that are the principal consumers of copper, including the United States and China. Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity; as such, one of its main industrial usage is for the production of
	cable, wire and electrical products for both the electrical and building industries. The construction industry also accounts for coppers second largest usage in such areas as pipes for plumbing, heating and ventilating as well as building wire
	and sheet metal facings. Accordingly, reduced demand in these and other industries in which copper is used could reduce the value of the Notes.





	The
	market value of the Notes may be affected by price movements in distant-delivery futures contracts associated with the Copper Spot Price.





	The price
	movements in the Copper Spot Price may not be reflected in the market value of the Notes. If you are able to sell your Notes, the price you receive could be affected by changes in the values of futures contracts on copper or similar underlying
	commodities that have more distant delivery dates than the spot price. The prices for these distant-delivery futures contracts may not increase to the same extent as the prices of the Copper Spot Price, or may decrease to a greater extent, which may
	adversely affect the value of the Notes.





	Changes in the methodology used to calculate the Copper Spot Price, or changes in laws or regulations, may
	affect the value of the Notes.





	The copper committee of the LME may make recommendations to the executive committee of the LME as to contract
	specifications, trading procedures, delivery points and policy issues related to the trading of copper contracts on the LME in a way that may adversely affect the Copper Spot Price and the value of the Notes. The copper committee and the LME have no
	obligation to consider your interests. The LME also may from




	 







	TS-5










	 




	time to time change any rule or bylaw or take emergency action under its rules, any of which could affect the Copper Spot Price. Any change of this kind could cause a decrease in the Copper Spot
	Price, which would adversely affect the value of the Notes.




	In addition, the price of copper could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new
	laws or regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations (including, without limitation, those relating to taxes and duties on commodities or commodity components) by one or more governments, governmental agencies or
	instrumentalities, courts, or other official bodies. Any event of this kind could adversely affect the Copper Spot Price and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.




	Other Terms of the Notes




	The following definitions supersede and replace the definition of
	Market Disruption Event set forth beginning on page P-12 of product supplement ARN-3.





	Market Disruption Event





	A Market Disruption Event means any of the following events, as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent:



	 





	 




	(A)




	the suspension of or material limitation on trading in copper, or futures contracts or options related to copper, on the Relevant Market (as defined below);





	 





	 




	(B)




	the failure of trading to commence, or permanent discontinuance of trading, in copper, or futures contracts or options related to copper, on the Relevant Market;





	 





	 




	(C)




	the failure of the LME (as defined above) to calculate or publish the official reference price of copper for that day (or the information necessary for determining the official
	reference prices); or





	 





	 




	(D)




	any other event, if the Calculation Agent determines in its sole discretion that the event materially interferes with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to
	unwind all or a material portion of a hedge that we or our affiliates have effected or may effect as to the Notes.






	For the purpose of
	determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:



	 





	 




	(A)




	a limitation on the hours in a trading day and/or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announced change in the regular
	trading hours of the Relevant Market; and





	 





	 




	(B)




	a suspension of or material limitation on trading in the Relevant Market will not include any time when trading is not conducted or prices are not quoted by the LME in the
	Relevant Market under ordinary circumstances.







	Relevant Market





	Relevant Market means the market in London on which members of the LME, or any successor thereto, quote prices for the buying and selling of copper, or if such market is no longer the principal trading
	market for copper or options or futures contracts for copper, such other exchange or principal trading market for copper as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent which serves as the source of prices for copper, and any principal
	exchanges where options or futures contracts on copper are traded.

	Investor Considerations



	 





	You may wish to consider an investment in the Notes if:




	 







	§








	 





	You anticipate that the Copper Spot Price will increase moderately from the Starting Value to the Ending Value.






	 







	§








	 





	You accept that your investment may result in a loss, which could be significant, if the Copper Spot Price decreases from the Starting Value to the Ending Value.






	 







	§








	 





	You accept that the return on the Notes will not exceed the return represented by the Capped Value.






	 







	§








	 





	You are willing to forgo interest payments on the Notes, such as fixed or floating rate interest paid on traditional interest bearing debt securities.






	 







	§








	 





	You seek exposure to the Copper Spot Price with no expectation of benefits of owning copper or any related futures contract.






	 







	§








	 





	You are willing to accept that a trading market is not expected to develop for the Notes. You understand that secondary market prices for the Notes, if any, will
	be affected by various factors, including the actual and perceived creditworthiness of SEK.






	 







	§








	 





	You are willing to make an investment, the payments on which depend on the creditworthiness of SEK, as the issuer of the Notes.










	The Notes may not be appropriate investments for you if:




	 







	§








	 





	You anticipate that the Copper Spot Price will decrease from the Starting Value to the Ending Value or that the Copper Spot Price will not increase sufficiently
	over the term of the Notes to provide you with your desired return.






	 







	§








	 





	You are seeking principal protection or preservation of capital.






	 







	§








	 





	You seek a return on your investment that will not be capped at 32.10% over the Original Offering Price.






	 







	§








	 





	You seek interest payments or other current income on your investment.






	 







	§








	 





	You seek an investment that provides you with the benefits of owning copper or any related futures contracts.






	 







	§








	 





	You seek assurances that there will be a liquid market if and when you want to sell the Notes prior to maturity.






	 







	§








	 





	You are not willing or are unable to assume the credit risk associated with SEK, as the issuer of the Notes.








	 



	Other Provisions




	We will deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is in excess of three business days following the Pricing Date. Under Rule
	15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes
	more than three business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.




	In the original offering, the Notes will be sold in minimum investment amounts of 100 units.




	If you place an order
	to purchase the Notes, you are consenting to Merrill Lynch acting as a principal in effecting the transaction for your account.




	Merrill Lynch may use
	the Note Prospectus for offers and sales in secondary market transactions and market-making transactions in the Notes but is not obligated to engage in such secondary market transactions and/or market-making transactions. The distribution of the
	Note Prospectus in connection with such offers or sales will be solely for the purpose of providing investors with the description of the terms of the Notes that was made available to investors in connection with the initial offering of the Notes.
	Secondary market investors should not, and will not be authorized to, rely on the Note Prospectus for information regarding the issuer or for any purpose other than that described in the immediately preceding sentence. Merrill Lynch may act as
	principal or agent in these transactions, and any such sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market prices.





	Agent for Service of
	Process in New York





	Under the Indenture, we have irrevocably appointed Mr. David Dangoor, the honorary consul general of the Kingdom of Sweden
	in The City of New York as our authorized agent for service of process in any action based on the Notes or the Indenture brought against us in any U.S. state or federal court in The City of New York. The contact information for Mr. Dangoor is

	The Copper Spot Price




	The Copper Spot Price is a benchmark price for copper used in the markets where copper is sold by a cash seller and settled in United States dollars. The Copper Spot Price is the second ring official reference
	price for Copper Grade A contracts traded on the LME, quoted in U.S. dollars per ton, as determined at approximately 12:35 p.m. London time. Copper Grade A is the LMEs second largest traded contract. The Copper Grade A Contract began trading
	on the LME in June 1986. The Copper Spot Price is published by Bloomberg, L.P. under the symbol LOCADY.




	The LME is an exchange-traded market based in
	London. Members of the LME typically trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks, including those of credit, are between the two parties to a transaction.




	An investment in the Notes does not entitle you to any ownership interest, either directly or indirectly, in copper or in any copper transaction traded on the LME.




	The Notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the LME. The LME takes no responsibility for the accuracy and/or the completeness of
	information provided in this term sheet, the accompanying product supplement ARN-3, the accompanying prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. In addition, the LME is not responsible for and has not participated in the determination of
	the timing of the sale of the Notes, prices at which the Notes are to initially be sold, or the quantities of the Notes to be issued or in the determination or calculation of the amount payable on maturity. The LME has no obligation in connection
	with the administration, marketing, or trading of the Notes.








	The following graph sets forth the monthly historical performance of the
	Copper Spot Price in the period from January 2005 through December 2010. This historical data on the Copper Spot Price is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the Copper Spot Price or what the value of the Notes may be. Any
	historical upward or downward trend in the Copper Spot Price during any period set forth below is not an indication that the Copper Spot Price is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes. On the Pricing
	Date, the Copper Spot Price was 9,788.00.

	Summary Tax Consequences




	You should consider the United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	We intend to take the position that the Notes will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts to purchase copper and, by
	purchasing a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to that treatment.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Under the treatment agreed to above, the gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
	holder held the Note more than one year immediately before the disposition.









	You should refer to the product supplement related
	to this offering for additional information relating to U.S. federal income tax and should consult your own tax advisors to determine tax consequences particular to your situation.









	Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations




	Below is a summary of certain U.S. federal income
	tax considerations for U.S. investors (U.S. Holders) that are initial holders of the Notes and that hold the Notes as capital assets. The following summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the discussions under the
	section entitled Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations beginning on page P-18 of the accompanying product supplement ARN-3, which you should carefully review prior to investing in the Notes.





	General.    

	We intend to take the position that the Notes will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward
	contracts to purchase copper and, by purchasing a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to that treatment. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will be so treated. We also will take the position that at the time of issuance of
	your Note you deposit irrevocably with us a fixed amount of cash equal to the purchase price of your Note to assure the fulfillment of your purchase obligation, which deposit will be non-interest bearing and will be unconditionally and irrevocably
	applied at the maturity date to satisfy that obligation at the maturity date. Although you will be obligated to treat the purchase price as a deposit for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the cash proceeds that we will receive from the offering will
	not be segregated by us during the term of your Note, but instead will be commingled with our other assets.




	No statutory, administrative or judicial
	authority directly addresses the treatment of holders of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will agree with the tax consequences described in this discussion. A differing
	treatment from that assumed herein could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S.
	federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes in light of their own particular circumstances, as well as the effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws.





	Sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of Notes.    

	A U.S. holders initial tax basis in the Notes should be the price at
	which the U.S. holder purchased the Notes. Upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of Notes in a taxable disposition, a U.S. holder should generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds received (including amounts
	received at maturity) and the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in the Note. Under the treatment agreed to above, the gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder
	held the Note more than one year immediately before the disposition. Long-term capital gains of individuals are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.





	Regulatory and Legislative Developments Related to Taxation of Prepaid Forward Contracts.    

	On December 7, 2007, the IRS and U.S.
	Treasury Department issued a notice requesting public comments on a comprehensive set of tax policy issues raised by prepaid forward contracts, including several different approaches under which U.S. holders of prepaid forward contracts could be
	required to recognize ordinary income on a current basis, or could be treated as owning directly the assets subject to the prepaid forward contract. Although it is currently uncertain what future guidance will result from the notice, the notice
	leaves open the possibility that such guidance could have retroactive application. In addition, prospective investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors about the potential impact of several proposed legislative changes in the taxation
	of derivatives contracts, and the likelihood that any of the foregoing may take effect.




	It is also possible that future regulations or other IRS
	guidance would require you to accrue income with respect to the Notes on a current basis at ordinary rates (as opposed to capital gains rates) in excess of any amounts paid currently or to treat the Notes in another manner that significantly differs
	from the agreed-to treatment discussed above.






	Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax
	consequences, in light of their particular circumstances, under the laws of the United States and any other taxing jurisdiction, of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. See the discussion under the section entitled Certain
	U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations beginning on page P-18 of the accompanying product supplement ARN-3.

	oral statements as well as any other written materials. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under Risk Factors in the sections indicated on the cover of this term sheet. The Notes involve risks not
	associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before you invest in the Notes.

	Market-Linked Investments Classification




	Market-Linked Investments come in four basic categories, each designed to meet a different set of investor risk profiles, time horizons, income requirements and
	market views (bullish, bearish, moderate outlook, etc.).

	The following descriptions of these categories are meant solely for informational purposes and are not intended to represent any particular Market-Linked Investment or guarantee
	performance. Certain Market-Linked Investments may have overlapping characteristics.







	Market Downside Protection:


	Market Downside
	Protection Market-Linked Investments combine some of the capital preservation features of traditional bonds with the growth potential of equities and other asset classes. They offer full or partial market downside protection at maturity, while
	offering market exposure that may provide better returns than comparable fixed income securities. It is important to note that the market downside protection feature provides investors with protection only at maturity, subject to issuer credit risk.
	In addition, in exchange for full or partial protection, you forfeit dividends and full exposure to the linked assets upside. In some circumstances, this could result in a lower return than with a direct investment in the asset.






	Enhanced Income:


	These short- to medium-term market-linked notes offer you a way to enhance your income stream, either though variable or
	fixed-interest coupons, an added payout at maturity based on the performance of the linked asset, or both. In exchange for receiving current income, you will generally forfeit upside potential on the linked asset. Even so, the prospect of higher
	interest payments and/or an additional payout may equate to a higher return potential than you may be able to find through other fixed-income securities. Enhanced Income Market-Linked Investments generally do not include market downside protection.
	The degree to which your principal is repaid at maturity is generally determined by the performance of the linked asset. Although enhanced income streams may help offset potential declines in the asset, you can still lose part or all of your
	original investment.






	Market Access:


	Market Access notes may offer exposure to certain market sectors, asset classes and/or strategies
	that may not even be available through the other three categories of Market-Linked Investments. Subject to certain fees, the returns on Market Access Market-Linked Investments will generally correspond on a one-to-one basis with any increases or
	decreases in the value of the linked asset, similar to a direct investment. In some instances, they may also provide interim coupon payments. These investments do not include the market downside protection feature and, therefore, your principal
	remains at risk.






	Enhanced Return:


	These short- to medium-term investments offer you a way to enhance exposure to a particular market view
	without taking on a similarly enhanced level of market downside risk. They can be especially effective in a flat to moderately positive market (or, in the case of bearish investments, a flat to moderately negative market). In exchange for the
	potential to receive better-than market returns on the linked asset, you must generally accept a degree of market downside risk and capped upside potential. As these investments are not market downside protected, and do not assure full repayment of
	principal at maturity, you need to be prepared for the possibility that you may lose all or part of your investment.

Index: Rogers
International Commodity Index – Total Return (RICI-Total Return Index)
The RICI-Total Return Index
is an index of 36 commodity futures contracts, representing commodities
consumed in the global economy. The RICI-Total Return Index is a composite, United
States dollar-based total return index that reflects the return on a fully
collateralized investment in the future contracts, ranging from agriculture to
energy and metals products. The RICI-Total Return Index aims to be an effective
measure of the price action of raw materials in the United States and around
the world. The RICI-Total Return Index was launched by James B. Rogers, Jr. (Jim
Rogers) on July 31, 1998 and is published under the symbol ROGRTR on Bloomberg.
RICI-Total
Return Index Weighting and Rebalancing
The RICI-Total Return Index’s
weightings attempt to balance consumption patterns (in developed and developing
countries worldwide) and specific contract liquidity. Below is a current list
of the futures contracts (Index Components) comprising the RICI-Total Return
Index as well as their respective initial weightings. The initial weightings
are the weights of each constituent commodity in the RICI-Total Return Index
set on April 5, 2007.
The RICI – Total Return Index
is overseen and managed by a committee (RICI Committee.) Jim Rogers chairs the
RICI Committee and controls its decisions. The RICI Committee reviews the
selection and weighting of the futures contracts in the RICI – Total Return
Index annually. Weights are assigned during each month of December for the
following year, if necessary. The RICI-Total Return Index is rebalanced monthly
during each roll period towards its initial weights.

RETURN INDEX



Historical
Performance of the RICI-Total Return Index
The following chart provides
a comparison of performance of the RICI – Total Return Index and the Dow
Jones-AIG Commodity Index® - Total ReturnSM for a period beginning September 30, 1998 through September 28, 2007. Both
indices are rebased to 100 on September 30, 1998. The historical RICI-Total
Return Index levels do not give an indication of future performance of the
RICI-Total Return Index. There can be no assurance that the future performance
of the RICI-Total Return Index or the Index Components will result in holders
of the securities receiving a positive return on their investment.
What Are
Some of the Risks of RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS?
An investment in RICI–Total
Return ELEMENTS involves risks. Some of these risks are summarized here, but
you are urged to read the further and more detailed explanation of risks in “Risk
Factors” in the prospectus.



1.


 


No Principal Protection – If the value of the RICI-Total
  Return Index decreases, or does not increase by an amount greater than the
  aggregate investor fee applicable to your RICI–Total Return ELEMENTS, you
  will receive less than your original investment.




 


 


 




2.


 


Commodity Market and Index Risk – The return on RICI–Total Return
  ELEMENTS is linked to the performance of the RICI-Total Return Index which, in
  turn, is linked to the prices of the Index Components. Commodity futures
  prices may change unpredictably, affecting the value of the Index Components
  and, consequently, the value of your RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS in
  unforeseeable ways. The index publisher may suspend or discontinue the
  calculation or publication of the RICI-Total Return Index making it difficult
  to determine the market value of the RICI-Total Return Index and of your RICI-Total
  Return ELEMENTS which, may in turn, adversely affect the market price of your
  RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS.




 


 


 




 


 


 


HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON




 


 







 


 


 




3.


 


Concentrated Investment Risk – Because the Index Components are
  concentrated in commodities in general, your investment may carry risks
  similar to a concentrated securities investment in the commodities sector.




 


 


 




4.


 


No Interest Payments – You will not receive any periodic
  interest payments on RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS.




 


 


 




5.


 


Issuer Risk – Since RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS
  are unsecured debt securities of SEK, the amount due on RICI-Total Return
  ELEMENTS is dependent on SEK’s ability to pay.




 


 


 




6.


 


A Trading Market for RICI-Total
  Return ELEMENTS May Not Develop – Although RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS are listed on a U.S.
  securities exchange, a trading market may not develop. The issuer is not
  required to maintain any listing of RICI-Total Return ELEMENTS on an
  exchange.



 
How do I get started?

Accelerated Return NotesSM


 


Linked to the Global
  Equity Index Basket due


,2009



 
Summary
 
The Accelerated Return NotesSM Linked to a Global Equity Index Basket due March      , 2009 (the “Notes”)
are senior, unsecured debt securities of AB Svensk Exportkredit (Swedish Export
Credit Corporation), Inc. that provide a leveraged return for investors,
subject to a cap, if the value of the Global Equity Index Basket (the “Basket”)
increases from the Starting Value, which will be set to 100 on the Pricing
Date, to the Ending Value of the Basket, determined on valuation dates shortly
before the maturity date of the Notes. Investors must be willing to forego
interest payments on the Notes and be willing to accept a repayment that may be
less, and potentially significantly less, than the original public offering
price of the Notes. 
 
The Basket is comprised of
the S&P 500® Index, the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50SM Index and the Nikkei 225® Index (each a “Basket Component Index” and
together the “Basket Component Indices”), of which the weightings will be 33.34%,
33.33% and 33.33%, respectively, on the Pricing Date. With the Starting Value
of the Basket being set to 100, the weighting assigned to each Basket Component
Index will result in an almost equal contribution to the value of the Basket on
the Pricing Date.

Hypothetical Payout Profile
 

 
This graph reflects the
hypothetical returns on the Notes, assuming a Capped Value of 17.00%, the midpoint of
the range of 15.00% and 19.00%. The green line reflects the hypothetical returns on the Notes, while
the dotted gray line reflects the hypothetical return of an investment in the Global Equity
Index Basket excluding dividends.
 
This graph has been prepared
for purposes of illustration only. Your actual return will depend on the actual
Ending Value, Capped Value and the term of your investment.
 
Hypothetical Payments at Maturity
 
Set forth below are three
examples of payment at maturity calculations, assuming a Capped Value of
$11.70, the midpoint of the range of $11.50 and $11.90.
 
Example 1—The
hypothetical Ending Value is 80.00% of the Starting Value:
 
Starting Value:  100.00
Hypothetical Ending
Value:  80.00
 

 
Payment at maturity (per
unit) = $8.00
 
Example 2—The
hypothetical Ending Value is 105.00% of the Starting Value:
 
Starting Value:  100.00
Hypothetical Ending
Value:  105.00
 

 
Payment at maturity (per
unit) = $11.50
 
Example 3—The hypothetical
Ending Value is 120.00% of the Starting Value:
 
Starting Value:  100.00
Hypothetical Ending
Value:  120.00
 

 
Payment at maturity (per
unit) = $11.70 (Payment at maturity cannot be greater than the Capped
Value)

The following table
illustrates, for a Starting Value and a range of hypothetical Ending Values of
the Basket:
 
·                                          the percentage
change from the Starting Value to the hypothetical Ending Value;
·                                          the total amount
payable on the maturity date per unit;
·                                          the total rate
of return to holders of the Notes;
·                                          the pretax
annualized rate of return to holders of the Notes; and
·                                          the pretax
annualized rate of return of a hypothetical investment in the stocks included
in the Basket Component Indices, which includes an assumed aggregate dividend
yield of 2.26% per annum, as more fully described below.
 
The table below assumes a
Capped Value of $11.70, the midpoint of the range of $11.50 and $11.90.

(1)                   The annualized rates of
return specified in this column are calculated on a semiannual bond equivalent
basis and assume an investment term from December 21, 2007
to February 21, 2009, a term expected to be similar to that of the Notes.
 
(2)                   This rate of return assumes:
 
(a)        a percentage change in the
aggregate price of the stocks included in the Basket Component Indices that
equals the percentage change in the Basket from the Starting Value to the
relevant hypothetical Ending Value;
 
(b)       a constant dividend yield of
2.26% per annum (which equals the weighted average of a dividend yield of 2.04%
for the S&P 500 Index, 3.37% for the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50
Index and 1.38% for the Nikkei 225 Index), paid quarterly from the date of
initial delivery of the Notes, applied to the value of the Basket at the end of
each quarter assuming this value increases or decreases linearly from the
Starting Value to the applicable hypothetical Ending Value; and
 
(c)        no transaction fees or
expenses.
 
(3)                   The Starting Value will be
set at 100 on the Pricing Date.
 
(4)                   The total amount
payable on the maturity date per unit of the Notes cannot exceed the Capped
Value. This table assumes a Capped Value of $11.70 (the midpoint of the range
of $11.50 and $11.90).
 
The above figures are for
purposes of illustration only. The actual amount received by you and the
resulting total and pretax annualized rates of return will depend on the actual
Ending Value, Capped Value and term of your investment.

Risk Factors
 
An
investment in the Notes involves significant risks. The following is a list of
certain of the risks involved in investing in the Notes. You should carefully review
the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the “Risk
Factors” sections included in the product supplement and the prospectus and
prospectus supplement identified below under “Additional Note Terms”. We also
urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers
before you invest in the Notes.
 
·                       Your investment
may result in a loss.
·                       Your yield may
be lower than the yield on other debt securities of comparable maturity.
·                       You must rely on
your own evaluations regarding the merits of an investment linked to the
Basket.
·                       Your return is
limited and may not reflect the return on a direct investment in the stocks
included in the Basket Component Indices.
·                       Your return may
be affected by factors affecting international securities markets.
·                       You will not
have the right to receive cash dividends or exercise ownership rights with
respect to the stocks included in the Basket Component Indices.
·                       In seeking to
provide investors with what we believe to be commercially reasonable terms for
the Notes while providing Merrill Lynch with compensation for its services, we
have considered the costs of developing, hedging and distributing the Notes. If
a trading market develops for the Notes (and such a market may not develop),
these costs are expected to affect the market price you may receive or be
quoted for your Notes on a date prior to the stated maturity date.
·                       Changes in the
value of one or more Basket Component Indices may offset each other.
·                       The respective
publishers of the Basket Component Indices may adjust the Basket Component
Indices in a way that affects their levels, and these respective publishers
have no obligation to consider your interests.
·                       Many factors
affect the trading value of the Notes; these factors interrelate in complex
ways and the effect of any one factor may offset or magnify the effect of another
factor.
·                       Purchases and
sales by us and our affiliates may affect your return.
·                       Potential
conflicts of interest could arise.
·                       Tax consequences
are uncertain.
 
Investor Considerations
 
You may wish
to consider an investment in the
Notes if:
 
·                       You anticipate
that the Index will appreciate moderately from the Starting Value to the Ending
Value.
·                       You accept that
your investment may result in a loss, which could be significant, if the level
of the Index decreases from the Starting Value to the Ending Value.
·                       You accept that
the return on the Notes will not exceed the Capped Value.
·                       You are willing
to forego interest payments on the Notes, such as fixed or floating rate
interest paid on traditional interest bearing debt securities.
·                       You want
exposure to the Index with no expectation of dividends or other benefits of
owning the underlying securities.
·                       You are willing
to accept that a trading market is not expected to develop for the Notes.
 
The Notes may not be appropriate investments
for you if:
 
·                       You anticipate
that the Index will depreciate from the Starting Value to the Ending Value or
that the Index will not appreciate sufficiently over the term of the Notes to
provide you with your desired return.
·                       You are seeking
principal protection or preservation of capital.
·                       You seek a
return on your investment that will not be capped at a percentage that will be
between 15.00% and 19.00%.
·                       You seek
interest payments or other current income on your investment.
·                       You want to
receive dividends or other distributions paid on the stocks included in the
Index.
·                       You want

Notes prior to maturity.

Other Provisions
 
We may deliver the Notes
against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than
three business days following the Pricing Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the initial settlement on the Notes
occurs more than three business days from the Pricing Date, purchasers who wish
to trade Notes more than three business days prior to the original issue date
will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a
failed settlement.
 
If you place an order to
purchase these offered securities, you are consenting to each of MLPF&S and
its broker-dealer affiliate First Republic Securities Company, LLC acting as a
principal in effecting the transaction for your account. MLPF&S is acting
as an underwriter and/or selling agent for this offering and will receive
underwriting compensation from the issuer of the securities.
 
The Basket
 
The Basket is designed to
allow investors to participate in the percentage changes in the levels of the
Basket Component Indices from the Starting Value to the Ending Value of the
Notes. The Basket Component Indices are described in the section below. Each
Basket Component Index will be assigned a weighting on the Pricing Date, as set
forth in the table below. With the Starting Value of the Basket being set to
100, the weighting assigned to each Basket Component Index will result in an
almost equal contribution to the value of the Basket on the Pricing Date.
 
The respective publishers of
the Basket Component Indices have no obligations relating to the Notes or
amounts to be paid to you, including any obligation to take the needs of SEK or
of holders of the Notes into consideration for any reason. These respective publishers
will not receive any of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes and are not
responsible for, and have not participated in, the offering of the Notes and
are not responsible for, and will not participate in, the determination or
calculation of the amount receivable by holders of the Notes. All disclosure
contained in this term sheet regarding any Basket Component Index, including
with limitation, its make-up, method of calculation and changes in components
has been derived from publicly available information prepared by the
distributor of the Basket Component Index. Neither SEK nor MLPF&S have
independently verified the accuracy or completeness of that information.
 
For more information on the
Basket, please see the section entitled “The Market Measure—Baskets” in the
product supplement ARN.

The Basket Component Indices
 
S&P 500 Index
 
The S&P 500 Index is
published by Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw Hill
Companies, Inc. (“Standard & Poor’s” or “S&P”). The S&P
500 Index is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock
price movement in the United States. The calculation of the level of the
S&P 500 Index, discussed below in further detail, is based on the relative
value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of
a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common
stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941
through 1943. As of November 30, 2007, 425 companies or 83.9% of the
market capitalization of the S&P 500 Index traded on the New York Stock
Exchange; 75 companies or 16.1% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500
Index traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market; and no companies traded on the
American Stock Exchange. As of November 30, 2007, the aggregate market
value of the 500 companies included in the S&P 500 Index represented
approximately 74% of the aggregate market value of stocks included in the
Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide Database of domestic common stocks
traded in the U.S., excluding American depositary receipts, limited
partnerships and mutual funds. Standard & Poor’s chooses companies for
inclusion in the S&P 500 Index with the aim of achieving a distribution by
broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings
in the common stock population of the Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide
Database, which Standard & Poor’s uses as an assumed model for the
composition of the total market. Relevant criteria employed by Standard &
Poor’s include the viability of the particular company, the extent to which
that company represents the industry group to which it is assigned, the extent
to which the market price of that company’s common stock is generally
responsive to changes in the affairs of the respective industry and the market
value and trading activity of the common stock of that company. Ten main groups
of companies comprise the S&P 500 Index, with the approximate percentage of
the market capitalization of the S&P 500 Index included in each group as of
November 30, 2007 indicated in parentheses: Consumer Discretionary (8.8%);
Consumer Staples (10.3%); Energy (11.9%); Financials (18.5%); Health Care
(12.3%); Industrials (11.6%); Information Technology (16.3%); Materials (3.3%);
Telecommunication Services (3.5%); and Utilities (3.6%). Standard &
Poor’s may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or
delete companies from, the S&P 500 Index to achieve the objectives stated
above.
 
The S&P 500 Index does
not reflect the payment of dividends on the stocks included in the S&P 500
Index. Because of this, the calculation of the Ending Value will not reflect
the payment of dividends on these stocks that investors would receive if they
were to purchase these stocks and hold them for a period equal to the term of
the Notes.
 
The
following graph sets forth the historical performance of the S&P 500 Index
in the period from February 2002 through November 2007. This
historical data on the S&P 500 Index is not necessarily indicative of the
future performance of the S&P 500 Index or what the value of the Notes may
be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the S&P 500
Index during any period set forth below is not an indication that the S&P
500 Index is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the
term of the Notes. On December 20, 2007, the closing level of the S&P
500 Index was 1,460.12.

All disclosure contained in
this term sheet regarding the S&P 500 Index, including, without limitation,
its mark-up, method of calculation and changes in its components has been
derived from publicly available information prepared by Standard &
Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“Standard &
Poor’s” or “S&P”). SEK and MLPF&S have not independently verified and
make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information.
None of SEK, the calculation agent and MLPF&S accepts any responsibility
for the calculation, maintenance or publication of the S&P 500 Index or any
successor index.
 
Computation of the S&P 500 Index
 
While S&P currently
employs the following methodology to calculate the S&P 500 Index, no
assurance can be given that S&P will not modify or change this methodology
in a manner that may affect the amount an investor receives on the maturity
date of the Notes.
 
Historically, the market
value of any underlying stocks included in the S&P 500 Index was calculated
as the product of the market price per share and the number of the then
outstanding shares of that underlying stock. In March 2005, S&P began
shifting the S&P 500 Index half way from a market capitalization weighted
formula to a float-adjusted formula, before moving the S&P 500 Index to
full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. S&P’s criteria
for selecting stocks for the S&P 500 Index did not change by the shift to
float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company’s weight in the
S&P 500 Index (i.e., its market value).
 
Under float adjustment, the
share counts used in calculating the S&P 500 Index reflect only those
shares that are available to investors, not all of a company’s outstanding
shares. Standard and Poor’s defines three groups of shareholders whose holdings
are subject to float adjustment:
 
·                       holdings by
other publicly traded corporations, venture capital firms, private equity
firms, strategic partners, or leveraged buyout groups;
 
·                       holdings by
government entities, including all levels of government in the United States or
foreign countries; and
 
·                       holdings by
current or former officers and directors of the company, founders of the
company, or family trusts of officers, directors, or founders, as well as
holdings of trusts, foundations, pension funds, employee stock ownership plans,
or other investment vehicles associated with and controlled by the company.
 
However, treasury stock,
stock options, restricted shares, equity participation units, warrants,
preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. In
cases where holdings in a group exceed 10% of the outstanding shares of a
company, the holdings of that group are excluded from the float-adjusted count
of shares to be used in the S&P 500 Index calculation. Shares held by
mutual funds, investment advisory firms, pension funds, or foundations not
associated with the company and investment funds in insurance companies, shares
of a United States company traded in Canada as “exchangeable shares,” shares
that trust beneficiaries may buy or sell without difficulty or significant
additional expense beyond typical brokerage fees, and, if a company has
multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted or non-traded
class if such shares are convertible by shareholders without undue delay and
cost, are also part of the float.
 
For each stock, an investable
weight factor(“IWF”) is calculated by dividing (x) the available float
shares, defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held in one or more
of the three groups listed above where the group holdings exceed 10% of the
outstanding shares, by (y) the total shares outstanding. The
float-adjusted index is then calculated by dividing (w) the sum of the IWF
multiplied by both the price and the total shares outstanding for each stock by
(z) the index divisor. For companies with multiple classes of stock,
Standard & Poor’s calculates the weighted average IWF for each stock
using the proportion of the total company market capitalization of each share
class as weights.
 
The S&P 500 Index is
calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology: the level of the
S&P 500 Index reflects the total market value of all 500 component stocks
relative to the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 (the “base period”).
An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order
to make the value easier to work with and track over time. The actual total
market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941
through 1943 has been set an indexed value of 10. This is often indicated by
the notation 1941-43 = 10. In practice, the
 
8




 
daily calculation of the
S&P 500 Index is computed by dividing the total market value of the component
stocks by the “index divisor.” By itself, the index divisor is an arbitrary
number. However, in the context of the calculation of the S&P 500 Index, it
serves as a link to the original base period level of the S&P 500 Index.
The index divisor keeps the S&P 500 Index comparable over time and is the
manipulation point for all adjustments to the S&P 500 Index.
 
S&P 500 Index Maintenance
 
S&P 500 Index maintenance
includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and
deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price
adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs.
 
To prevent the level of the
S&P 500 Index from changing due to these corporate actions, all corporate
actions which affect the level of the S&P 500 Index require an index
divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index divisor for the change in total
market value of an individual company the level of the S&P 500 Index
remains constant. This helps maintain the level of the S&P 500 Index as an
accurate barometer of stock market performance and ensures that the movement of
the S&P 500 Index is not caused by the corporate action of an individual
company. All index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and
after the calculation of the S&P 500 Index closing level.
 
Some corporate actions, such
as stock splits and stock dividends, require simple changes in the common
shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the S&P 500
Index and do not require divisor adjustments.
 
Changes in a company’s shares
outstanding of 5.0% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings,
private placements, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made
as soon as reasonably possible. All other changes of 5.0% or more (due to, for
example, company stock repurchases, redemptions, exercise of options, warrants,
subscription rights, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity
participation units, or other recapitalizations) are made weekly and are
announced on Tuesday for implementation after the close of trading on
Wednesday. Changes of less than 5.0% are accumulated and made quarterly on the
third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced
two days prior.
 
Also, changes in IWFs of more
than ten percentage points caused by corporate actions (such as merger and
acquisition activity, restructurings, or spinoffs) will be made as soon as
reasonably possible. Other changes in IWFs will be made annually, in September when
IWFs are reviewed.

The Dow
Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index
 
The Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50
Index was created by STOXX Limited., a joint venture founded by SWX Group,
Deutsche Borse AG and Dow Jones & Company, Inc. Publication of
the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index began on February 28, 1998, based on an
initial level of the index of 1,000 at December 31, 1991. The Dow Jones
EURO STOXX 50 Index was created to reflect the market-capitalization weighted
performance of large companies from the major industry groupings in Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. The companies included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index
account for approximately 60% of the free-float market capitalization of the
Dow Jones EURO STOXX Total Market Index, which in turn accounts for
approximately 95% of the free-float market capitalization of the countries with
companies eligible for inclusion in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index.
 
The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the Dow
Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index in the period from February 2002 through November 2007.
This historical data on the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index is not necessarily
indicative of the future performance of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index or
what the value of the Notes may be. Any historical upward or downward trend in
the level of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index during any period set forth below
is not an indication that the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index is more or
less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes. On December 20,
2007, the closing level of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index was 4,314.70.

All disclosure contained in
this term sheet regarding the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index (“DJ EURO STOXX 50
Index”), including, without limitation, its make-up, method of calculation and
changes in its components, has been derived from publicly available sources.
The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to changes by STOXX
Limited (“STOXX”). SEK and MLPF&S have not independently verified and make
no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. None
of SEK, the calculation agent and MLPF&S accepts any responsibility for the
calculation, maintenance or publication of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index or any
successor index.
 
The DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index
was created by STOXX, a joint venture founded by SWX Group, Deutsche Borse AG
and Dow Jones. Publication of the Index began on February 28, 1998, based
on an initial level of the Index of 1,000 at December 31, 1991.
 
The DJ EURO STOXX to Index
was created to reflect the market capitalization weighted performance of large
companies from the major industry groupings in Austria, Belgium, Finland,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The
companies included in the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index account for approximately 60%
of the free-float market capitalization of the Dow Jones DJ EURO STOXX Total
Market Index, which in turn accounts for approximately 95% or the free-float
market capitalization of the countries with companies eligible for inclusion in
the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index.
 
The DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index is
currently calculated by: (i) multiplying the per share price of each
underlying security by the number of free-float adjusted outstanding shares
(and, if the stock is not quoted in euros, then multiplying by the related
country currency and an exchange factor which reflects the exchange rate
between the related country currency and the euro); (ii) calculating the
sum of all of all these products (the “DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index Aggregate Market
Capitalization”); and (iii) dividing the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index Aggregate
Capitalization by a divisor which represents the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index
Aggregate Market Capitalization on the base of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index and
which can be adjusted to allow changes in the issued share capital of
individual underlying securities, including the deletion and addition of
stocks, the substitution of stocks, stock dividends and stock splits, to be
made without distorting the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index. Because of this
capitalization weighting, movements in share prices of the underlying
securities of companies with relatively greater market capitalization will have
a greater effect on the level of the entire DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index than will
movements in share prices of the underlying securities of companies with
relatively smaller market capitalization.
 
The weight of each stock that
comprises the DJ EURO STOXX to Index is capped at 10% of the DJ EURO STOXX 50
Index’s total free-float market capitalization. The free-float weights are
reviewed quarterly.
 
The composition of the DJ
EURO STOXX 50 Index is reviewed annually, and changes are implemented on the
third Friday in September, using market data from the end of August as the
basis for the review process. Changes in the composition of the DJ EURO STOXX
50 Index are made to ensure that the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index includes those
companies which, within the eligible countries and within each industry sector,
have the greatest market capitalization. Changes in the composition of the DJ
EURO STOXX 50 Index are made entirely by STOXX without consultation with the
companies represented in the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index or SEK or Merrill Lynch.
The DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index is also reviewed on an ongoing basis, and a change
in the composition of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index may be necessary if there have
been extraordinary events for one of the issuers of the underlying securities,
e.g., delisting, bankruptcy, merger or takeover. In these cases, the event is
taken into account as soon as it is effective. The underlying securities may be
changed at any time for any reason. Neither STOXX nor any of its founders is
affiliated with ML&Co. nor have they participated in any way in the
creation of the Notes.
 
SEK or Merrill Lynch or its
affiliates may presently or from time to time in business with the publishers,
owners, founders or creators of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index or any of its
successors or one or more of the issuers of the underlying securities,
including extending loans to, making equity investments in or providing
advisory services, including merger and acquisition advisory services, to the
publishers, their successors, founders or
 
10




 
creators or to any of the
issuers. In the course of business with the issuers, Merrill Lynch or its
affiliates may acquire non-public information with respect to the issuers.
Merrill Lynch may also act as market maker for the common stocks of the
issuers. Neither SEK or Merrill Lynch makes any representation to any purchaser
of the Notes with respect to any matters whatsoever relating to any of the
publishers, their successors, founders or creators or to any of the issuers.
Any prospective purchaser of the Notes should undertake an independent
investigation of the composition of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index does not reflect
any investment or sell recommendations of Merrill Lynch or its affiliates.
 
A representative of an
affiliate of Merrill Lynch may from time to time be a member of the STOXX
Limited Advisory Committees. STOXX states in its Guide to the Dow Jones
STOXX Indexes that STOXX’s
Advisory Committee advises the Supervisory Board on matters relating to the DJ
EURO STOXX 50 Index. This advisory committee proposes changes in the composition of
the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index to the Supervisory Board and makes recommendations
with respect to the accuracy and transparency of the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Index
computation. Decisions on the composition and changes in the DJ EURO STOXX 50
Index are reserved to the Supervisory Board.

The Nikkei
225 Index
 
The Nikkei 225 Index is a
stock index calculated, published and disseminated by Nikkei that measures the
composite price performance of selected Japanese stocks. The Nikkei 225 Index
is currently comprised of 225 stocks that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
(the “TSE”) and represents a broad cross-section of Japanese industry. All 225
of the stocks underlying the Nikkei 225 Index (the “Underlying Stocks”) are
stocks listed in the First Section of the TSE. Stocks listed in the First Section are
among the most actively traded stocks on the TSE. Nikkei calculates the Nikkei
225 Index by multiplying the per share price of each Underlying Stock by the
corresponding weighting factor for that Nikkei 225 Underlying Stock,
calculating the sum of all these products and dividing that sum by a divisor.
As of October 1, 2007, the divisor was 24.341, and is subject to periodic
adjustments. Futures and options contracts on the Nikkei 225 Index are traded
on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
 
The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the Nikkei
225 Index in the period from February 2002 through November 2007. This
historical data on the Nikkei 225 Index is not necessarily indicative of the
future performance of the Nikkei 225 Index or what the value of the Notes may
be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the level of the Nikkei 225
Index during any period set forth below is not an indication that the Nikkei 225 Index is more or less
likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes. On December 20, 2007,
the closing level of the Nikkei 225 Index was 15,031.60.

All disclosure contained in
this term sheet regarding the Nikkei 225 Index, including, without limitation,
its make-up, method of calculation and changes in its components has been
derived from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies
of Nikkei, Inc (“Nikkei”) as stated in these sources and these policies are
subject to change at the discretion of Nikkei. SEK and MLPF&S have not
independently verified and make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness
of such information. None of SEK, the calculation agent and MLPF&S accepts
any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of the
Nikkei 225 Index or any successor index.
 
The Nikkei 225 Index is a
modified, price-weighted index. Each stock’s weight in the Nikkei 225 Index is
based on its price per share rather than the total market capitalization of the
issuer. Nikkei calculates the Nikkei 225 Index by multiplying the per share
price of each Underlying Stock by the corresponding weighting factor for that
Nikkei 225 Underlying Stock (a “Weight Factor”), calculating the sum of all
these products and dividing that sum by a divisor. The divisor, initially set
on May 16, 1949 at 225, was 24.341 as of October 1, 2007, and is
subject to periodic adjustments as set forth below. Each Weight Factor is
computed by dividing ¥50 by the par value of the relevant Nikkei 225 Underlying
Stock, so that the share price of each Nikkei 225 Underlying Stock when
multiplied by its Weight Factor corresponds to a share price based on a uniform
par value of ¥50. Each Weight Factor represents the number of shares of the
related Nikkei 225 Underlying Stock which are included in one trading unit of
the Nikkei 225 Index. The stock prices used in the calculation of the Nikkei
225 Index are those reported by a primary market for the Nikkei 225 Underlying
Stocks, which is currently the TSE. The level of the Nikkei 225 Index is
calculated once per minute during TSE trading hours.
 
In order to maintain
continuity in the level of the Nikkei 225 Index in the event of certain changes
due to non-market factors affecting the Nikkei 225 Underlying Stocks, such as
the addition or deletion of stocks, substitution of stocks, stock dividends,
stock splits or distributions of assets to stockholders, the divisor used in
calculating the Nikkei 225 Index is adjusted in a manner designed to prevent
any instantaneous change or discontinuity in the level of the Nikkei 225 Index.
The divisor remains at the new value until a further adjustment is necessary as
the result of another change. As a result of each change affecting any Nikkei
225 Underlying Stock, the divisor is adjusted in such a way that the sum of all
share prices immediately after the change multiplied by the applicable Weight
Factor and divided by the new divisor, i e., the level of the Nikkei 225 Index
immediately after the change, will equal the level of the Nikkei 225 Index
immediately prior to the change.
 
The Nikkei 225 Underlying
Stocks may be deleted or added by Nikkei. However, to maintain continuity in
the Nikkei 225 Index, the policy of Nikkei is generally not to alter the
composition of the Nikkei 225 Underlying Stocks except when an Underlying Stock
is deleted in accordance with the following criteria. Any stock becoming
ineligible for listing in the First Section of the TSE due to any of the
following reasons will be deleted from the Nikkei 225 Underlying Stocks:
bankruptcy of the issuer; merger of the issuer into, or acquisition of the
issuer by, another company; delisting of the stock or transfer of the stock to
the “Seiri-Post” because of excess debt of the issuer or because of any other
reason; or transfer of the stock to the Second Section of the TSE. Upon
deletion of a stock from the Nikkei 225 Index, Nikkei will select, in
accordance with certain criteria established by it, a replacement for the
deleted Underlying Stock. In an exceptional case, a newly listed stock in the
First Section of the TSE that is recognized by Nikkei to be representative
of a market may be added to the Nikkei 225 Underlying Stocks. As a result, an
existing Underlying Stock with low trading volume and not representative of a
market will be deleted.
 
None of SEK, MLPF&S and
Nikkei accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or
publication of the Nikkei 225 Index or any successor index. Nikkei disclaims
all responsibility for any errors or omissions in the calculation and
dissemination of the Nikkei 225 Index or the manner in which the Nikkei 225
Index is applied in determining any Starting Value or Ending Value or any
Redemption Amount payable to you on the maturity date of the Notes.
 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange
 
The TSE is one of the world’s
largest securities exchanges in terms of market capitalization. Trading hours
are currently from 9.00 A.M. to 11.00 A.M. and from 1.00 P.M. to 3.00 P.M.,
Tokyo time, Monday through Friday.
 
12




 
Due to the time zone
difference, on any normal trading day the TSE will close prior to the opening
of business in New York City on the same calendar day. Therefore, the closing
level of the Nikkei 225 Index on a trading day will generally be available in
the United States by the opening of business on the same calendar day.
 
The TSE has adopted certain
measures, including daily price floors and ceilings on individual stocks,
intended to prevent any extreme short-term price fluctuations resulting from
order imbalances. In general, any stock listed on the TSE cannot be traded at a
price lower than the applicable price floor or higher than the applicable price
ceiling. These price floors and ceilings are expressed in absolute Japanese
yen, rather than percentage limits based on the closing price of the stock on
the previous trading day. In addition, when there is a major order imbalance in
a listed stock, the TSE posts a “special bid quote” or a “special asked quote”
for that stock at a specified higher or lower price level than the stock’s last
sale price in order to solicit counter-orders and balance supply and demand for
the stock. Prospective investors should also be aware that the TSE may suspend
the trading of individual stocks in certain limited and extraordinary
circumstances, including, for example, unusual trading activity in that stock.
As a result, changes in the Nikkei 225 Index may be limited by price
limitations or special quotes, or by suspension of trading, on individual
stocks which comprise the Nikkei 225 Index, and these limitations may, in turn,
adversely affect the value of the Notes.
 
License Agreement
 
Nikkei and SEK have entered
into or, to the extent required, will enter into a non-exclusive license
agreement providing for the license to SEK, in exchange for a fee, of a right
to use indices owned and published by Nikkei in connection with some
securities, including the Notes.
 
Nikkei is under no obligation
to continue the calculation and dissemination of the Nikkei 225 Index. The
Notes are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Nikkei. No inference
should be drawn from the information contained in this term sheet that Nikkei
makes any representation or warranty, implied or express, to SEK, the holder of
the Notes or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing
in securities generally or in the Notes in particular or the ability of the
Notes to track general stock market performance. Nikkei has no obligation to
take the needs of SEK or the holders of the Notes into consideration in
determining, composing or calculating the Nikkei 225 Index. Nikkei is not
responsible for, and has not participated in the determination of the timing
of, prices for, or quantities of, the Notes to be issued or in the
determination or calculation of the equation by which the Notes are to be
settled in cash Nikkei has no obligation or liability in connection with the
administration or marketing of the Notes. The use of and reference to the
Nikkei 225 Index in connection with the Notes have been consented to by Nikkei,
the publisher of the Index. The copyright relating to the Nikkei 225 Index and
intellectual property rights as to the indications for “Nikkei” and the Nikkei
225 Index and any other rights belong to Nikkei, Inc.
 
Certain U.S. Federal Income Taxation Considerations
 
See the
discussion under the section entitled “United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations” in the accompanying product supplement ARN. Prospective
purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
tax consequences, in light of their particular circumstances, under the laws of
the United States and any other taxing jurisdiction, of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes.

Our history
We have supported the Swedish export industry with financing for over 50 years. SEK was founded jointly by the Swedish government and major Swedish banks in 1962, but since 2003 SEK has been wholly owned by the Swedish government.









The post-war years: new need for financing
Industrial competition increased following the restoration of Europe’s production capabilities after the Second World War. Buyers’ demanded increasingly generous terms of credit, which became a burden for Swedish industry and the banking sector couldn’t cope. So Sweden’s commercial banks wanted to establish an export finance institution with state-funded guarantees.
1962: SEK is founded
When it was formed in 1962 the Swedish Export Credit Corporation, SEK, was jointly owned by the Swedish government and the commercial banks. Our very first transaction was the financing of the cargo ship M/S Berit, which was built at Finnboda Shipyard in 1962-1963 for export to the Åland Islands.
The 1960s and 1970s: lending gets easier
SEK made a number of changes in the 1960s that made it easier to lend to the export sector. This allowed more Swedish exporters to access loans and become more competitive.
The 1970s were a period of uncertainty around the world, and the Oil Crisis and economic conditions in both OECD nations and developing countries created new demands for lending. Most credit institutions around the world were forced to offer borrowers more generous terms. This led to a raft of international agreements on lending between 1976 and 1978.



 












SEK facts
1978 saw the introduction of the state-funded Swedish credit system. Since 2003 SEK has been wholly owned by the Swedish government.









1980s and 1990s: clarification of our role
1978 saw the introduction of the state-supported credit system (the SEK system) in Sweden. SEK provided lending at subsidized interest rates and compensated for foreign exchange losses, allowing us to offer our clients the best terms in Sweden.
In 1979, we signed special credit agreements with the Soviet Union and China. We provided state-funded export credits to help Swedish exports. In the 1980s, we developed new products to strengthen the Swedish export sector.
In the late 1990s, ABB replaced the banks as SEK’s co-owner and since 2003 SEK has been wholly owned by the Swedish government.
SEK today: boosting Swedish exports
We offer expertise in international capital markets, as well as knowledge of the corporate culture and conditions in different countries. SEK's international borrowing and lending capabilities are ranked among the best in the world. We use this knowledge and experience to help more Swedish businesses succeed abroad.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
