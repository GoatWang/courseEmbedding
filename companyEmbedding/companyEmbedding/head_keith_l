General Counsel Forum


                  In 1997, Roland Castañeda left the private practice of law to be the general counsel of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Authority (DART). Though his years of practice had prepared him as a lawyer, he had received little education and training in leading and managing a large legal department.
 
In the fall of 1997, he met with one of his Dallas outside counsel, Forrest Smith (partner with the Dallas firm of Bell Nunnally & Martin), and discussed starting an organization in which legal best practices could be shared between in-house leadership in corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies. Forrest believed that busy general counsel would not take the time to meet with other general counsel for general networking and to discuss best practices.
 
Roland deferred the idea, but it continued to gnaw at him. In a few months he was talking with Forrest again about the idea and Forrest suggested vetting it with several of Forrest’s general counsel clients. They met with Tom Everhart (Raytheon), Keith McDole (GC, Occidental Chemical), Rod Miller (GC, Southern Baptist Annuity Board), Ron Taylor (GC, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas), and Terry Taylor (GC, ClubCorp). Roland outlined his proposal and the other general counsel thought it was a terrific idea. Forrest offered to provide the initial funding to pay the expenses required to set up the organization and in the fall of 1998, the Dallas-Fort Worth General Counsel Management Practices Forum (“DFWGCMPF”) was founded.
