Excellent!!

These are so easy to use and I'm so glad I don't have to worry about digestion issues by using these patches. I have recommended them to everyone I see because of how easy to use they are and the price is perfect too.

Five Stars is Not Enough Stars!

Let me start by saying that I have never had bariatric surgery before, and found the multiple vitamin patch by accident online while trying to find an OTC pain patch for my knee. This is the first time in my 60 years of living on this Earth that I have found something that actually works and works almost immediately. I have tried every vitamin and mineral supplement on the market at one time or the other and words are not enough to express how great the multiple vitamin and mineral supplement patch is. I am not kidding when I say that five stars is not enough stars to rate these patches.

On day 1, I noticed increased energy levels. After about 5 days of using the patch, I noticed my lifelong and otherwise, weak, brittle, peeling, fragile fingernails were thicker and hard as rocks. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE - NEVER, and I've even taken vitamin shots on a weekly basis for over a year while on a calorie restricted diet. I wasn't looking for or even expecting this to happen. In less than 10 days of starting these patches I no longer feel the need to take a nap during the day and this is the first Saturday in my lifetime that I woke up at a decent hour wide awake and ready to get out of bed. The change in my energy level is so noticeable that my husband tried one of the patches, and on the first day, he noticed a significant energy boost. Now is using up my patches and won't go a day without one!

There is no comparison between these patches and regular vitamin shots, high dosages of B12, or anything I have ever bought or been prescribed in my 60 years of life on this Earth. The convenience of simply putting on one patch versus taking a handful of pills each day - well, words are not enough to describe. I will never, ever, ever, ever go back to taking vitamins/mineral supplements by mouth again. I was not prepared, nor expecting, to see these results over several months of use, much less, over just a day or two of use.

Multi vitamin gold!

This is the best thing that has ever happened for me. I recently got weight loss surgery and anything by mouth has to be crushed. These patches have made my life so much easier. One less thing to worry about. There super easy to use and give me all I need in one simple little patch.

Best way to get your vitamins!

I've encountered 2 issues when buying vitamins: 1. HUGE horse pills 2. Chewables have a bad taste. I was thrilled when I saw this simple convenient option. It's so easy to peel and stick these anywhere! Also easy to take when traveling - so small. Thanks to you, I will never have to look for another source for post op vitamins!

A great alternative for the entire family!

 I first learned about the variety of vitamins and supplements available from Patch MD when I was preparing for bariatric surgery. This seemed like an ideal solution for me since most of the chewable vitamins on the market contain some sort of sugar substitute, which I had completely eliminated everywhere else in my diet. However, it turns out that these products became the ideal solution for my wife and daughters, who have a problem with vitamin absorption and always complained about the numerous digestive side effects they found when using OTC multi-vitamins and iron supplements. My daughters iron levels have significantly increased after using this product for just one month. My wife hasn't gotten her blood work yet, but I am certain they will reflect the benefits of using the patch rather than oral delivery method. I will report back after the Doctor checks her results.

Multi-vitamin patch

I've used the Multi-vitamin patch for 4 days now. The first day, I blistered. The 2nd and 3rd days I ended up with beautiful red squares where the patches were placed. Today, no irritation. I'm gonna keep trying because I hate swallowing pills!

Fabulous

 These patches are great. They take the place of several tablets over the course of a day, are more economical than their separate counterparts, and take only seconds to use. You can apply them at any time, and since they absorb over eight hours, it doesn't matter if you forget it in the morning, there's still time in your day to apply it and forget it. The true picture will come when my lab results show that I have in fact taken my supplements!

I love my multivitamin patches! Will definitely keep ordering them. So convenient and you don't have to worry about timing of vitamins and food.
