MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION ON
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB CRITERIA
 
 
KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (the "Asserting Party") is
responsible for assessing compliance for the transactions listed on Attachment
A for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 (the "Reporting
Period"), with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section
229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "CFR"), except for the
criteria set forth in Sections 229.1122(d)(3)(i) - (iv) which the Asserting
Party has concluded are not applicable to the servicing of the transactions
listed on Attachment A, backed by commercial real estate mortgage loans and
serviced by the Asserting Party (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). Although
the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Sections
229.1122 (d)(1)(ii) and 229.1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Asserting Party during the year ended
December 31, 2011 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with.
 
The Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party
has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the transactions listed on Attachment A backed by commercial mortgages
serviced by the Asserting Party.
 
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

Approximately $951 Million of Structured Securities Affected

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on eight P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on two P&I classes were affirmed because the ratings are 
consistent with Moody's expected loss.




The ratings on the two IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.2% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.2% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.1% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.0% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in this rating were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating CMBS Large Loan/Single Borrower Transactions" 
published in July 2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 17, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, property type and sponsorship. Moody's 
also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits 
associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 17, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 8% to $951 
million from $1.0 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 40 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 15% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 64% of the pool.




Three loans, constituting 7% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans are currently in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2013 operating results for 93% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2014 operating results for 73% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 86%, 
the same as at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 13% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.72X and 1.22X, 
respectively, compared to 1.75X and 1.22X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 33% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the InterContinental Hotel Chicago Loan ($141.6 
million -- 14.9% of the pool), which 
is secured by a 792-key full-service hotel located on North 
Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The property includes 
over 25,000 square feet (SF) of meeting space, a Michael Jordan's 
steakhouse restaurant, and an indoor junior Olympic size pool. 
Property performance has improved since securitization, in line 
with Moody's expectation. The property has fared well relative 
to its competitors as evidenced by a RevPAR penetration index in excess 
of 102% for the past three years. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 91% and 1.22X, respectively, compared 
to 93% and 1.20X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the SunTrust Bank Portfolio I Loan ($99.7 
million -- 10.5% of the pool). The 
loan is secured by 119 bank branches and two single-tenant office 
buildings. As of December 2014, the properties were 100% 
leased to SunTrust Bank (Moody's senior unsecured rating Baa1, stable 
outlook) as part of a master lease agreement through December 2017 with 
multiple additional lease extensions.. The collateral was 
part of a larger net lease sale from Inland American Real Estate Trust 
to American Realty Capital. The total transaction was approximately 
$2.3 billion. Approximately $223 million of 
the purchase price was allocated to the subject collateral. The 
properties are located in nine Eastern states, from Maryland to 
Florida. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 66% and 1.47X, 
respectively, compared to 67% and 1.45X at the last 
review.




The third largest loan is the Asheville Mall Loan ($72.4 
million -- 7.6% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by a 324,000 SF portion of a 1 million square foot regional 
mall located in Asheville, North Carolina. The mall anchors 
include Dillard's, Sears, JC Penney, Belk, and 
Barnes and Noble. As of June 2014, the total mall was 97% 
leased compared to 100% at last review and in-line space 
was 98% leased and has reported occupancy above 94% since 
at least 2008. Property performance has continued to improve since 
securitization. The loan sponsor is CBL & Associates Properties, 
Inc., a retail REIT based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 75% and 1.33X, respectively, 
compared to 89% and 1.12X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating

Approximately $685 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, December 16, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on nine classes and 
upgraded the ratings on two classes J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-C5, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2011-C5 as follows:

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on seven P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on two P&I classes (Classes B & C) were upgraded based 
primarily on an increase in credit support resulting from loan paydowns 
and amortization. The deal has paid down 20% since Moody's 
last review.




The ratings on the IO classes (Classes X-A & X-B) were 
affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating 
factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.1% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.5% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 1.5% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.2% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, 
and "Moody's Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single 
Borrower CMBS" published in October 2015. Please see the 
Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of 
these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 12, 
compared to 16 at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, property type and sponsorship. Moody's 
also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits 
associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the November 15, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 31% to $712 
million from $1.03 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by thirty mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 19.5% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans constituting 71.6% of the pool.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, The Cove at Southern ($6 million), has been 
liquidated from the pool, resulting in a realized loss of less than 
a 1% of the loan balance. Two loans, constituting 
2.9% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. 
The largest specially serviced loan is the Fairview Heights Plaza loan 
($10.9 million -- 1.5% of the pool), 
which is secured by a 199,000 square foot (SF) community retail 
center located in Fairview Heights, Illinois, 10 miles east 
of St. Louis, Missouri. The property is anchored by 
a 60,000 SF Gordmans. However, the former Sports Authority 
space (40,500 SF) recently went dark. As of December 2016, 
the property was 81% leased. The loan transferred to Special 
Servicing in May 2016 due to imminent default.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 98% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 79% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 80%, 
compared to 84% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 12% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.88X and 1.33X, 
respectively, compared to 1.75X and 1.26X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 42% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the InterContinental Hotel Chicago Loan ($139 
million -- 19.5% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 792-key full-service hotel located on North Michigan 
Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The property includes over 25,000 
SF of meeting space, a Michael Jordan's steakhouse restaurant, 
full service spa and an indoor junior Olympic size pool. The property 
saw a decline in performance in 2015. For the trailing-twelve 
month period ending December 2015, the property had a RevPAR penetration 
of 95.5% compared to its competitive set. The RevPAR 
penetration is down from the prior three years which were all in excess 
of 102%. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 106% and 
1.05X, respectively, compared to 106% and 1.04X 
at the last review.




The second largest loan is the SunTrust Bank Portfolio I Loan ($89 
million -- 12.6% of the pool). The loan is secured 
by 119 bank branches and two single-tenant office buildings. 
The properties are 100% leased to SunTrust Bank (Moody's senior 
unsecured rating Baa1, stable outlook) as part of a master lease 
agreement. The properties are located in nine Eastern states, 
from Maryland to Florida. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 56% 
and 1.74X, respectively, compared to 66% and 
1.48X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Asheville Mall Loan ($70 million 
-- 9.8% of the pool). The loan is secured by 
a 324,000 square foot component of a 974,000 square foot regional 
mall located in Asheville, North Carolina. The mall anchors 
include Dillard's, Sears, JC Penney, Belk, and 
Barnes and Noble. The total mall was 99% leased as of December 
2015 compared to 97% at last review and in-line space was 
98% leased. The mall has reported occupancy above 94% 
since at least 2008. The loan sponsor is CBL & Associates Properties, 
Inc., a retail REIT based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 72% and 1.38X, respectively, 
compared to 74% and 1.36X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

John McCain, R-Ariz., joined two other Republican holdouts and all the Democrats to vote against the measure. McCain stunned several of his fellow Republican senators when he walked onto the Senate floor after midnight and appeared to inform Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that he couldn’t vote for the “skinny repeal” bill. Just a few days earlier, McCain flew back to the Capitol from Arizona after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer to cast the deciding vote to begin debating it.John McCain statement in full explaining why he killed Donald Trump's 'skinny' healthcare repeal billThe IndependentWatch: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'WKYC Cleveland9,042Reactions.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Approximately $936 Million of Structured Securities Affected

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the ten P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.2% 
of the current balance compared to 2.9% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.0% of the original pooled balance compared to 2.8% 
at the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base 
expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in this rating were "Moody's Approach to Rating 
U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 2000 
and "Moody's Approach to Rating CMBS Large Loan/Single Borrower Transactions" 
published in July 2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v 
2.64, which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. 
Conduit model results at the Aa2 (sf) level are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Conduit model results at the 
B2 (sf) level are based on a paydown analysis using the individual loan-level 
Moody's LTV ratio. Moody's may consider other concentrations 
and correlations in its analysis. Based on the model pooled credit 
enhancement levels of Aa2 (sf) and B2 (sf), the required credit 
enhancement on the remaining conduit classes are either interpolated between 
these two data points or determined based on a multiple or ratio of either 
of these two data points. For fusion deals, Moody's 
merges the credit enhancement for loans with investment-grade credit 
assessments with the conduit model credit enhancement for an overall model 
result. Moody's incorporates negative pooling (adding credit 
enhancement at the credit assessment level) for loans with similar credit 
assessments in the same transaction.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 17, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model v 8.7 and then reconciles and weights the results 
from the conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, property type and sponsorship. Moody's 
also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits 
associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 17, 2014 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 7% to $963 
million from $1.03 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 40 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 15% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 64% of the pool. The pool does not currently 
contain any defeased loans, loans with structured credit assessments, 
specially serviced loans or loans on the master servicer's watchlist.




One loan, The Cove at Southern ($6 million), has been 
liquidated from the pool, resulting in a realized loss of less than 
a 1% of the loan balance.




Moody's received full year 2012 operating results for 100% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2013 operating results for 92% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 86% 
compared to 88% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 13% 
to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.75X and 1.22X, 
respectively, compared to 1.73X and 1.20X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 33% of the pool. The 
largest loan is the InterContinental Hotel Chicago Loan ($144 million 
-- 14.9% of the pool), which is secured by a 
792-key full-service hotel located on North Michigan Avenue 
in Chicago, Illinois. The property includes over 25,000 
square feet (SF) of meeting space, a Michael Jordan's steakhouse 
restaurant, and an indoor junior Olympic size pool. Property 
performance has improved since securitization, in line with Moody's 
expectation. The property's revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
increased by 3.6% in 2013 to $156. The property 
has fared well relative to its competitors as evidenced by a RevPAR penetration 
index in excess of 103% for the past three years. Moody's 
current LTV and stressed DSCR are 93% and 1.20X, respectively, 
compared to 98% and 1.13X at Moody's last review.




The second largest loan is the SunTrust Bank Portfolio I Loan ($100 
million -- 10.4% of the pool). The loan is secured 
by 119 bank branches and two single-tenant office buildings. 
The properties are 100% leased to SunTrust Bank (Moody's senior 
unsecured rating A3, stable outlook) as part of a master lease agreement. 
The collateral was part of a larger net lease sale from Inland American 
Real Estate Trust to American Realty Capital. The total transaction 
was approximately $2.3 billion. Approximately $223 
million of the purchase price was allocated to the subject collateral. 
The properties are located in nine Eastern states, from Maryland 
to Florida. Moody's current LTV and stressed DSCR are 67% 
and 1.45X, respectively, compared to 68% and 
1.43X at last review.




The third largest loan is the Asheville Mall Loan ($74 million 
-- 7.7% of the pool). The loan is secured by 
a 324,000 SF portion of a 1 million square foot regional mall located 
in Asheville, North Carolina. The mall anchors include Dillard's, 
Sears, JC Penney, Belk, and Barnes and Noble. 
The mall was 99.8% leased as of December 2013 and has reported 
occupancy above 94% since at least 2008. The loan sponsor 
is CBL & Associates Properties, Inc., a retail 
REIT based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Moody's current LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 89% and 1.12X respectively, 
compared to 87% and 1.14X at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Approximately $866 Million of Structured Securities Affected

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes (Class X-A and X-B) were 
affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating 
factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.5% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.2% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.2% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.1% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were " Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodology page 
on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 16, 
compared to a Herf of 17 at last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure and property type. Moody's also further adjusts 
these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan 
level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the May 17, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 13% to $893 
million from $1 billion at securitization. The certificates 
are collateralized by 39 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 
1% to 16% of the pool, with the top ten loans constituting 
65% of the pool.




Eight loans, constituting 13% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, The Cove at Southern ($6 million), has been 
liquidated from the pool, resulting in a realized loss of less than 
a 1% of the loan balance. No loans are currently in special 
servicing.




Moody's received full or partial year 2015 operating results for 90% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 85%, 
compared to 86% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 12% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.75X and 1.26X, 
respectively, compared to 1.72X and 1.22X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 35% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the InterContinental Hotel Chicago Loan ($140 
million -- 15.7% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 792-key full-service hotel located on North Michigan 
Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The property includes over 25,000 
square feet (SF) of meeting space, a Michael Jordan's steakhouse 
restaurant, full service spa and an indoor junior Olympic size pool. 
The property saw a decline in performance in 2015. For the trailing-twelve 
month period ending December 2015, the property had a RevPAR penetration 
of 95.5% compared to its competitive set. The RevPAR 
penetration is down from the prior three years which were all in excess 
of 102%. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 106% and 
1.04X, respectively, compared to 91% and 1.22X 
at the last review.




The second largest loan is the SunTrust Bank Portfolio I Loan ($100 
million -- 11.2% of the pool). The loan is secured 
by 119 bank branches and two single-tenant office buildings. 
The properties are 100% leased to SunTrust Bank (Moody's senior 
unsecured rating Baa1, stable outlook) as part of a master lease 
agreement. The properties are located in nine Eastern states, 
from Maryland to Florida. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 66% 
and 1.48X, respectively, compared to 66% and 
1.47X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Asheville Mall Loan ($71 million 
-- 7.9% of the pool). The loan is secured 
by a 324,000 square foot component of a 974,000 square foot 
regional mall located in Asheville, North Carolina. The mall 
anchors include Dillard's, Sears, JC Penney, Belk, 
and Barnes and Noble. The total mall was 99% leased as of 
December 2015 compared to 97% at last review and in-line 
space was 98% leased. The mall has reported occupancy above 
94% since at least 2008. The loan sponsor is CBL & Associates 
Properties, Inc., a retail REIT based in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 74% and 1.36X, 
respectively, compared to 75% and 1.33X at the last 
review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.
