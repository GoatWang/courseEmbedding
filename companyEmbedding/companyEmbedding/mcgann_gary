Smurfit Kappa’s former chief executive, Gary McGann, plans to step down from the paper and packaging group’s board in May, as he devotes himself to restructuring and finding a new executive team at embattled baked products group Aryzta.
When Mr McGann took over as chairman of the Swiss-Irish food company behind Cuisine de France in December, he committed to stepping down from some other publicly quoted company boards. This was to comply with Aryzta’s own corporate governance rules, which state that non-executive directors can only serve on up to three additional publicly-quoted companies on an ongoing basis.
Aryzta’s then chairman Denis Lucey told Aryzta shareholders in November that Mr McGann was committed to “complying in full with the spirit as well as the letter of this requirement” within six months of his appointment.
Mr McGann (66), who joined Smurfit Kappa as chief financial officer in 1998, was elevated to the board two years later and became chief executive in 2002. He remained on the company’s board as a non-executive director after retiring as chief executive in August 2015 and is also also chairman of bookmaker Paddy Power and a non-executive director on the boards of property company Green Reit as well as US firm Multi Packaging Solutions.
‘Outstanding’
Smurfit Kappa chairman Liam O’Mahony thanked Mr McGann “for his outstanding achievements while leading the group as chief executive from 2002 to 2015”. The company said that another non-executive director, Thomas Brodin, will not seek re-election at the company’s annual general meeting on May 5th either.
Smurfit Kappa has meanwhile appointed former Carlsberg chief executive Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen to the board with immediate effect.
Mr McGann’s decision to step down from Smurfit Kappa’s board comes as he seeks to overhaul Aryzta, whose shares have slumped by 57 per cent over the past two years amid a series of profit warnings and weak earnings statements. Last month, the group’s chief executive Owen Killian, chief financial officer Patrick McEniff and head of the Americas division, John Yamin, each tendered their resignation - just weeks after it issued the latest profits alert.



The company now has a market value of €2.8 billion.
Aryzta also signalled last month that it would sell its 49 per cent stake in French frozen foods company Picard, which it acquired two years ago for €450 million. The acquisition was badly received at the time by analysts.
Aryzta also faces having to refinance €600 million of debt within the next year.

Introducing the new CEPI Chairman: Gary McGann, Group CEO of Smurfit Kappa 











Press Release | 06 Jan.2014
Introducing the new CEPI Chairman: Gary McGann, Group CEO of Smurfit Kappa 
“The competitiveness of industry needs to be on top of the EU agenda” 
The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) is pleased to announce the appointment of Gary McGann as its new Chairman. Mr McGann is Group CEO of Smurfit Kappa, one of the world’s leading paper-based packaging companies  headquartered in Ireland. He commenced as Chairman of CEPI on 1 January 2014, succeeding outgoing chairman, Mr Jussi Pesonen.

 On his appointment, Mr McGann stated that the global competitiveness of Europe remains an issue that needs to be addressed by the EU. “The pulp and paper industry is a leading sector in the bio-economy with a large renewable energy and raw material base. 82% of our raw materials are sourced in Europe and we produce 23% of the world’s pulp and paper products. But our industry – made in Europe – suffers from a lack of a favourable business climate in Europe”, said Mr McGann.
“As Chairman, I will support the CEPI Board and team in its effort to advance European competitiveness. The EU needs to create a complete single market and address areas such as energy policy. There is a need for greater certainty in regulation and creating an environment for industry which is enabling and makes business more efficient and more effective. We must also focus on delivering financial sustainability as much as environmental sustainability for industry in Europe”, added Mr McGann. “I believe CEPI has an important role to play in advancing these issues within the EU and ensuring competitiveness is on the agenda. CEPI and its team has a proven track record of successfully representing the paper industry at the highest level in Brussels and I look forward to working with them in the period ahead”.
Gary McGann became CEO of Smurfit Kappa in November 2002. Mr McGann is also Chairman of Aon Ireland, a director of IBEC (Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation), a director of the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and a member of the ERT (European Round Table of Industrialists). Mr McGann joined the (then) Jefferson Smurfit Group in 1998 as Chief Financial Officer and he holds a Master’s Degree in Management Science.

Cantillon: Survivor Garry McGann joins board of Paddy Power 
 Smurfit Kappa chief still seen as a good bet despite his time with Anglo Irish bank   



Thu, Nov 27, 2014, 01:05

Smurfit Kappa chief Gary McGann has joined the board of bookmaker Paddy Power as an independent non-executive director, the latest in a line of board seats to be held by one of Dublin’s foremost corporate warriors. He will also serve on the board’s audit committee.
Paddy Power’s stock market notification cited McGann’s stewardship of Aer Lingus and Gilbeys before his move to Smufit in 1998. Mention was made of his ongoing chairmanship of Aon Ireland, his non-executive chairmanship of Green REIT and a clutch of academic qualifications. 
But there was no mention of McGann’s former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank, whose collapse imposed such a burden on the State. McGann was on its board until the last, resigning along- side other non-executive directors in the days after Anglo’s nationalisation in 2009. The following month he resigned his chairmanship of the State-owned Dublin Airport Authority, saying he had “acted with honesty and integrity” at all times in Anglo.The stock market notice from Paddy Power also made no reference to McGann’s time on the DAA board. Indeed the single past directorship mentioned in a separate regulatory director declaration to the exchange is his previous place on the board of UDG Healthcare. The past directorships which fail to be cited are those held only in the previous five years. The links between Smurfit Kappa and Anglo were once strong. Former Anglo chairman Seán FitzPatrick was chairman of the Smurfit Kappa board until his departure from the bank, at which point he resigned a number of directorships.  Others from the Anglo era faded from view, but McGann is still standing. Paddy Power said its new director’s skills and experience will be of considerable value. No mention was made of his survival instincts.

Gary McGann of Smurfit Kappa named RISI’s 2014 European CEO of the Year



BRUSSELS, Jan. 15, 2014 (Press Release) – RISI, the leading information provider for the global forest products industry, has named Gary McGann, Chief Executive Officer of the Smurfit Kappa Group, as the 2014 European CEO of the Year. The award will be presented during RISI’s European Pulp & Paper Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, March 10-12, 2014.
McGann was nominated by a group of investment analysts and portfolio managers covering the European and global pulp and paper industry. The criteria for nomination include leadership, vision and strategic accomplishment.
McGann was selected from the nominees for a number of reasons. One analyst commented, “McGann has shown commitment to the long-term strategy and has not wavered-he has proved himself to be a steady hand at the helm.” Another said, “Last year was the year that the Smurfit Kappa Group delivered as a business for a number of reasons, profitability, successful integration of acquisitions and fantastic shareholder value.”
The Smurfit Kappa Group operates in 32 countries, 21 in Europe and 11 in the Americas. An integrated producer, the group has around 41,000 employees and sales last year were Euro 7.3 billion ($9.2 billion).
Before joining the Jefferson Smurfit Group in 1998, McGann was Group CEO of Aer Lingus, CEO of Gilbeys of Ireland and prior to that, group financial controller of Ericsson Ireland.
McGann is chairman of Aon Ireland, is a director of United Drug plc, a director of IBEC (Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation), and a director of the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. He is also a member of the ERT (European Round Table of Industrialists) and the incoming chairman of CEPI (Confederation of European Paper Industries).
RISI organizes four regional CEO awards each year in Europe, Asia, Latin America and North America, which are handed out to the winners at the regional RISI conferences. RISI also presents the Global CEO of the Year award during the annual PPI Awards event.
Previous European CEO of the Year winners are Peter Oswald, Mondi Europe & International in 2013; Miles Roberts, DS Smith in 2012; Jussi Pesonen, UPM in 2011; Jouko Karvinen, Stora Enso in 2010; Christian Rynning-Tønnesen of Norske Skog in 2009; Jouko Karvinen, Stora Enso in 2008; and UPM’s Jussi Pesonen in 2007.

Dead Work Awards
The 4A’s Dead Work Awards was a juried awards ceremony that showcased the work — submitted by various Philadelphia advertising agencies — which never lived to see the light of day. The event was held after-hours at the Mütter Museum, a venue with an extensive collection of medical oddities, which inspired the visual concept (and use of glow-in-the-dark ink!) for this promotional poster.Screen-printed in silver and glow-in-the-dark ink on black paper. Agency: Allen & GerritsenRole in Project: Concept Development and DesignCreative Direction: Ryan Johnson


















The Essence of Racing
As a sponsor of NASCAR, INDYCAR and the NHRA, Sunoco wanted to stake their claim as the "Official Fuel of Motorsports" in the United States. When it comes to race day, Sunoco is what makes burning rubber possible. We wanted to tell this story in an unexpected light.During the biggest race at the very start of the season, we launched a large scale, multi-media campaign to promote Sunoco's new designer fragrance, Burnt Rubbér, The Essence of Racing.While the name of the fragrance is indicative of the joke, a deadpan execution left viewers with the lingering uncertainty: Is this a legitimate product? Upon further investigation, they discovered: Yes, it is... and the only way to get it, is to win it through social media.The Takeaway: By allowing the brand to emulate the more subdued genre of high fashion, this tongue-in-cheek, “stunt-vertising” approach set Sunoco apart from the other loud, extreme voices that are typical of the category. It also blew up all of their social media accounts.  Agency: Allen & GerritsenRole in Project: Concept Development, Art Direction and DesignCopywriter: Ryan OverhiserCreative Direction: Brendan McGann & Gary Greenberg

THE CASE STUDY






Motorsports 2016
This Motorsports POP was created to promote Sunoco's sponsorship of NASCAR, the NHRA and INDYCAR at their stations. Each race car leaves a trail of Sunoco's brand colors to emphasize speed and distance in the context of the sport, while reinforcing the role of the brand to the consumer. Agency: Allen & GerritsenRole in Project: Concept Development, Art Direction and DesignCreative Direction & Copy: Brendan McGann
