JOINT ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS - OCTOBER 26, 1999



The enclosed Proxy is solicited by the Boards of Directors of Sit Large Cap
Growth Fund, Inc. ("Large Cap Fund"), Sit Mid Cap Growth Fund, Inc. ("Mid Cap
Fund"), Sit Small Cap Growth Fund ("Small Cap Fund"), Sit Balanced Fund
("Balanced Fund"), Sit Science and Technology Growth Fund ("Science and

("Developing Markets Fund"), (collectively the "Stock" Funds), Sit Money Market

("U.S. Government Fund"), Sit Bond Fund ("Bond Fund"), Sit Tax-Free Income Fund
("Tax-Free Income Fund"), and Sit Minnesota Tax-Free Income Fund ("Minnesota
Fund"), (collectively the "Bond" Funds), (the Stock and Bond Funds,
collectively, the "Funds"), in connection with the joint annual meeting of
shareholders of the Funds to be held at 1:45 p.m. (Minneapolis time) on Tuesday,
October 26, 1999 at the Edina Country Club, 5100 Wooddale Avenue, Edina,
Minnesota, and at any adjournments thereof. The cost of solicitation, including
the cost of preparing and mailing the Notice of the Joint Annual Meeting of
Shareholders and this Proxy Statement, will be paid by the Funds, and such
mailing will take place on approximately September 10, 1999. Representatives of
the Funds may, without cost to the Funds, solicit Proxies for the management of
the Funds by means of mail, telephone or personal calls.


The Sit Mutual Funds are comprised of six corporate issuers of either one
series or multiple series. Sit Mid Cap Growth Fund, Inc., Sit Large Cap Growth
Fund, Inc., Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc., and Sit Money Market
Fund, Inc. are issuers of one series (collectively, the "Non-Series Funds"). Sit
Mutual Funds, Inc. is the corporate issuer of the International Fund, Balanced
Fund, Developing Markets Fund, Small Cap Fund, Science and Technology Fund, and
Regional Fund; and Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc. is the corporate issuer of the
Tax-Free Income Fund, Minnesota Fund and Bond Fund, (collectively, the "Series
Funds").

Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share held. A majority of
the shares outstanding of each Non-Series Fund must be present in person or by
proxy to achieve a quorum and 10% of the shares outstanding of each Series Fund
must be present in person or by proxy to achieve a quorum. Shareholders of the
Series Funds vote together as shareholders of the corporate issuer. Provided a
quorum is represented, approval of proposals 1 and 2 requires the affirmative
vote of more than 50% of shares of each Fund represented at the meeting. None of
the matters to be presented at the meeting will entitle any shareholder to
cumulative voting or appraisal rights.


A proxy may be revoked before the meeting by giving written notice of
revocation to the Secretary of the Funds, or at the meeting prior to voting.
Unless revoked, properly executed proxies in which choices are not specified by
the shareholders will be voted "for" each item for which no choice is specified,
in accordance with the recommendation of the applicable Fund's Board of
Directors. In instances where choices are specified by the shareholders in the
proxy, those proxies will be voted or the vote will be withheld in accordance
with the shareholder's choice. With regard to the election of directors, votes
may be cast in favor or withheld. Abstentions may be specified on all proposals
other than the election of directors. Abstentions and votes withheld with
respect to the election of directors will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum of shares is present at the meeting with respect to
the item on which the abstention is noted, and will have the same effect as a
vote "against" such item. Under the Rules of the New York Stock Exchange, if a
proposal is considered "non-discretionary," then brokers who hold Fund shares in
street name for customers are not authorized to vote on such proposal on behalf
of their customers who have not furnished the broker specific voting
instructions. If a broker returns a "non-vote" proxy, indicating a lack of
authority to vote on a proposal, then the shares covered by such non-vote shall
not be counted as present for purposes of calculating the vote with respect to
such proposal. So far as the Board of Directors is aware, no matter other than
those described in this Proxy Statement will be acted upon at the meeting.
Should other matters properly come before the meeting calling for a vote of
shareholders, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the
enclosed proxy to act upon such matters according to their best judgment.


In the event that sufficient Proxy votes in favor of the proposals set forth
in the Notice of Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders are not received by
October 26, 1999, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more
adjournments of the meeting with respect to one or more of the Funds to permit
further solicitation of Proxies. With respect to any Fund, an adjournment will
require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present
in person or by Proxy at the meeting. The persons named as proxies will vote in
favor of such adjournments with respect to any of said proposals if the proxies
are instructed, by more than a majority of the shares represented in person or
by proxy, to vote "for" the proposal(s) for which the adjournment is being
proposed. The persons named as proxies will vote against such adjournment if
they are instructed (by a majority of the shares represented in person or by
proxy) to vote "against" the proposal(s) for which the adjournment is being
proposed.


Only shareholders of record on August 25, 1999 may vote at the meeting or
any adjournment thereof. As of August 25, 1999, the Funds had the following
number of issued and outstanding common shares, the only class of securities of
each Fund:








Large Cap Fund   2,616,474    Science and Technology Fund    938,907    Money Market Fund     69,937,863
Mid Cap Fund    25,596,577    Regional Fund                  562,302    U.S. Government Fund  15,536,523

Mr. Phillips has been a director of the Large Cap Fund, Mid Cap Fund,
U.S. Government Fund, Tax-Free Income Fund, and Money Market Fund since 1990,
the International Fund since 1993, and since inception for all other Funds. Mr.
Frenzel has been a director of the Small Cap Fund, Balanced Fund, Developing
Markets Fund, International Fund, Bond Fund, and Minnesota Fund since inception
and since 1992 for all other Funds. Dr. Jones was a director of the Mid Cap
Fund, Large Cap Fund, U.S. Government Fund, Tax-Free Income Fund, and Money
Market Fund from October, 1988 to July, 1989, and effective January 20, 1993 was
reappointed to each Board, and has been a director of all other Funds since
inception. Mr. Hulse has been a director of each Fund since July 28, 1995. All
other directors have been directors since the inception of each applicable Fund.


None of the persons named as nominees are directors of reporting
companies except for the Funds. "Reporting companies" include companies with a
class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 or subject to the requirements of Section 15(d) of such Act, or any
company registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").


The Funds do not have standing audit or nominating committees of the
Board of Directors, or committees performing similar functions. There were four
joint meetings of the Funds' Boards of Directors during their fiscal years ended
March 31, 1999 for the Bond Funds and June 30, 1999 for the Stock Funds. All but
one of the nominees attended all meetings. One of the nominees attended three of
the quarterly meetings. The following table sets forth the aggregate
compensation received by each Director for services provided to each Fund during
the most recently ended fiscal year of each Fund, as well as the total
compensation received by each Director for services provided to the thirteen
funds of the Sit Mutual Funds during such periods. Directors who are officers of
the Adviser or any of its affiliates did not receive any such compensation and
are not included in the table.

Pursuant to the advisory agreement with each Fund, the Adviser pays all
of the Funds' expenses including the compensation and expenses of the Directors
(but excluding extraordinary expenses, interest, brokerage commissions, and
other transaction charges relating to investing activities).


By completing the Proxy, you give the proxy the right to vote for the
persons named in the table above. If you elect to withhold authority for any
individual nominee, you may do so by making an "X" in the box marked "FOR", and
by striking a line through such nominee's name on the Proxy, as further
explained on the Proxy itself.


All of the nominees have agreed to serve as Directors. If any unforeseen
event prevents one or more of the nominees from serving as a director, your
votes will be cast for the election of a substitute or substitutes selected by
the Board. In no event, however, can the Proxies be voted for a greater number
of persons than the number of nominees named. Unless otherwise instructed, the
proxies will vote for the election of each nominee to serve as a Director.



EACH FUND'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE





ELECTION OF THE PERSONS NAMED ABOVE AS DIRECTORS.

PROPOSAL 2

RATIFICATION OR REJECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR



The 1940 Act provides that every registered investment company shall be
audited at least once each year by independent auditors selected by a majority
of the directors of the investment company who are not interested persons of the
investment company. The 1940 Act requires that such selection be submitted for
ratification or rejection by the shareholders at their next meeting following
such selection.


At a meeting held on July 29, 1999, the directors of the Funds selected
KPMG LLP to be each Fund's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending March
31, 2000 for the Bond Funds and June 30, 2000 for the Stock Funds. Such firm has
served as each Fund's independent auditor since each such Fund's inception. KPMG
LLP has no material direct or indirect financial interest in any of the Funds,
other than the receipt of fees for services to the Funds.


Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the meeting.
Such representatives will be given the opportunity to make statements to
shareholders if they so desire, and are expected to be available to respond to
any questions which may arise at the meeting.


By completing the Proxy, you give the proxy the right to vote for the
ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as each Bond Fund's independent
auditor for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000 and each Stock Fund's
independent auditor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.



EACH FUND'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR





RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF KPMG LLP AS EACH FUND'S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR.







SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 1999 MEETING



No proposals were received from shareholders this year. Any shareholder
proposal for consideration at the 2000 annual meeting, which will be held in
October, 2000, must be received by the Funds in writing on or before June 1,
2000.

Global Investment Outlook and Strategy
July 2017



Synchronized global growth, improving corporate earnings, benign inflation, and positive economic surprises have contributed to the solid performance of U.S. Equities in 2017.  Earnings growth has been the driver of stock appreciation in 2017.  Potential economic outcomes from the Trump administration’s policies, if effectively implemented, could boost U.S. Economic growth, but the impact of Washington’s partisan conflicts and the Federal Reserve’s unwinding of its bloated balance sheet are unknown.
Increases in the target fed funds rate have continued to move short-term yields higher, while the modest reduction of stimulus has partially relieved fears of rising inflation, which resulted in modestly lower longer-term yields.  The taxable bonds yield curve has flattened with a historically steep position, and we expect it to assume a naturally flatter shape as the Fed continues to normalize monetary policy.  As a result of the Fed’s implementation of balnace sheet reduction, we expect spreads to increase modestly on current coupon mortgages and, coupled wit the anticipated rise in interest rates, could lead to meaningful increases in mortgage rates.
The AAA tax-exempt municipal bond yield curve flattened during the second quarter due primarily to sizable yield declines across the middle and the long end of the curve.  Meanwhile, yields rose slightly on maturities of two years and less.  All durations of municipal bond indices posted a second consecutive quarter of positive returns, with longer maturities performing best for the period.  All investment-grade municipal bond index returns continued to be positive on the year.  Bonds with A and/or BBB ratings have generally outperformed more highly rated bonds.
In Europe, Brexit-related uncertainty, the Italian general election, and the eventual moderation of accommodative monetary policy remain key issues, but Euro Area economic data has consistently surprised to the upside in 2017.  Business activity and consumer confidence measure are near historically high levels, with domestic demand continuing to be the driver of incremental growth.  Employment conditions are improving, yet economic momentum is starting to show signs of moderation.
