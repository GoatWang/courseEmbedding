PAR INVESTMENT PARTNERS, L.P., Lead Plaintiff, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
ARUBA NETWORKS, INC.; DOMINIC P. ORR; MICHAEL M. GALVIN; KEERTI MELKOTE, Defendants-Appellees.


United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted February 15, 2017 — San Francisco, California.
Filed March 7, 2017.









NOT FOR PUBLICATION
MEMORANDUM*
PAR Investment Partners LP appeals the district court's order dismissing its second amended putative class action complaint with prejudice for failure to allege that Aruba Networks, Inc. and three of its executives made material misrepresentations or omissions regarding the competition for market share in the wireless networking industry. We affirm.
1. Material misrepresentation or omission.
PAR Investment's underlying theory of securities fraud rests on allegations that, throughout the class period, Aruba misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information regarding Cisco Systems, Inc.'s business operations in the market for wireless networking products and services. As the district court correctly held, these allegations do not constitute actionable securities fraud.
Companies and their executives generally cannot be held liable for securities fraud based on their alleged failure to disclose information regarding a competitor's business operations when, as here, the company has already made "detailed disclosures concerning the risk of competition." In re Stac Electronics Securities Litigation, 89 F.3d 1399, 1406 (9th Cir. 1996). Throughout the class period, Aruba made numerous public statements regarding the specific competitive threat posed by Cisco. For example, at the February 21, 2013 quarterly earnings call, Aruba disclosed to investors and market analysts that beginning in November 2012, Cisco had implemented a new sales campaign that shifted its focus away from competing "head on, on a technological ground" with Aruba (i.e., based solely on the quality of each company's respective wireless networking products) and was instead attempting to compete with Aruba through "aggressive pricing, bundling of wired and wireless products, and data center upgrades."
In addition to these specific disclosures, Aruba also made several general disclosures regarding the competition for market share with Cisco. For example, Aruba's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2012 identified Cisco as amongst its "primary competitors,"1 and stated that Aruba expected competition to "intensify in the future," which "could result in increasing pricing pressure, reduced profit margin, . . . and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could seriously harm [Aruba's] business, operating results or financial condition." Consistent with these disclosures, multiple public analyst reports acknowledged that as early as August 2012, Cisco's wireless bundling strategies posed a significant competitive threat to Aruba.
Given these disclosures, Aruba's carefully-worded public statements regarding Cisco's business operations and their effect on Aruba's revenue, market share, and success rate were not materially misleading and therefore do not satisfy the heightened pleading standards under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b). See Brody v. Transitional Hospitals Corp., 280 F.3d 997, 1006 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that, to be actionable, an omission must "affirmatively create an impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists" (emphasis added)); see also Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund v. Apollo Group Inc., 774 F.3d 598, 607 (9th Cir. 2014) ("The Plaintiffs' omissions theory fails to state a claim because the Defendants clearly disclosed material information to investors.").
2. Dismissal with prejudice.
As lead plaintiff and putative class representative, PAR Investment has filed two complaints asserting the same underlying theory of securities fraud. On appeal, PAR Investment has failed to provide any new allegations that would support its securities fraud claim. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the action with prejudice. See Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 1007 (9th Cir. 2009), as amended (Feb. 10, 2009) (holding that the "district court did not err when it dismissed [a private securities plaintiff's second amended putative class action complaint] with prejudice, since it was clear that the plaintiffs had made their best case and had been found wanting").
AFFIRMED.


FootNotes 
**  The Honorable Marvin J. Garbis, United States District Judge for the District of Maryland, sitting by designation.

*  This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.

1. We grant Aruba's requests for judicial notice of various court filings, public SEC filings, and public analyst reports for the limited purpose of determining what information was disclosed to the public during the class period.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
