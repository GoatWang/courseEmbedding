Actionable user data.  In-application feedback.  No coding required.
Pendo helps product managers uncover and attack what truly drives their product success








Product management insights from our blog






Product Trials and Data Tribulations

For many, product data during the trial period is feast or famine. They’re either overwhelmed with data, making it difficult to condense actionable insights, or they don’t have access to even the most basic session-level data.
Read article








The Rise of Product Leadership

Let’s not refer to a product manager as a generalist, a Swiss Army knife, or “CEO of a product.” Instead, let’s refer to product manager as a product leader. Because inspiring leaders are what we aspire to become.

Guidelines for Feature Releases

In-app messaging tools give you the ability to announce features. But rollouts can still be challenging. In this post, we’ll look at strategies for taming the complexity of feature rollouts, and getting value to your customers quickly and smoothly.
Read article






Product data helps to identify super users and early adopters
“When we release a new feature, I want to know how it’s being adopted and who the early adopters are, so we can reach out for feedback. The beauty of Pendo is that if you don’t tag something now, you can always go back later and tag it.”

Read the Full Story











Stop guessing and start knowing
Stop deciding what to build based on what you think users are doing — decide based on facts. Use real customer usage data to inform roadmap decisions and prioritize features that really help your business grow.


















Get incredibly relevant feedback
Reach users “in-the-moment” by gathering feedback directly in your application. Target your outreach to only survey users who have actually used the feature or capabilities you’re asking about.

About







We deliver product success
Pendo was founded in 2013 when alumni from Rally, Google, Cisco, and Red Hat combined their heads and hearts to build something they wanted but never had as product managers — a simple way to understand and attack what truly drives product success.
With powerful analytics, in-application user feedback, and contextual guidance designed to help companies measure and elevate the customer experience within their applications, Pendo is on a mission to improve society’s experience with software.
Proudly built in North Carolina but engineered to scale globally without losing that soul.






Pendo is a venture funded company that was selected as a top 10 startup to watch by NCTA in 2015

If we are unable to resolve any complaint related to Privacy Shield, or if we fail to acknowledge your complaint in a timely fashion, you may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority. Pendo has committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU. We will work with them to address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge to you. In certain circumstances, Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.
Pendo’s Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
What information does Pendo collect?
We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve the Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for the Services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We collect the following types of information:
A. Information You Provide to Us: Your Personal Information: We receive and store any information you provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.
Your Customers’ Personal Information: In order to provide you with the Services,  if you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we also receive and store any information you choose to provide us with respect to your customers (“End User Customers”). For more information on how we collect and compile End User Customer Information, please refer to our Terms of Service (www.pendo.io/terms-of-service).
The End User Customer information we receive and store must include a unique identifier for your end users, but will consist of any information you choose to provide us. Pendo does not collect any user-entered form field text in your application. You should avoid sending any of the following types of sensitive personal information to Pendo: government-issued identification numbers; specific financial information (such as credit or debit card numbers, any related security codes or passwords, and bank account numbers); information related to an individual’s physical or mental health; and information related to the provision or payment of health care. Pendo reminds you of your obligation to ensure your compliance with local laws and regulations regarding your Privacy Policy, notice to End User Customers, consent, opt-out, and other requirements.
B. Information Collected Automatically: Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited by you. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
When you visit the Website, whether as a Pendo customer or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). For example, Log Data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and the Services and for the Website’s technical administration, to increase our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.
C. E-mail and Other Communications: We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may communicate with you about your use of the Website or Services. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by adjusting the settings on your account screen in the Website. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
Does Pendo share my personal information?
We share customer information only as described below:
A. Third-Party Service Providers: We provide personal information to a limited number of third-party providers to process it for us or to perform functions on our behalf, based on our instructions, and under the Onward Transfer Principle. Included in these services are hosting and data storage provided by Google’s Cloud Platform as more fully described in the “Where does Pendo store data?” section below. Third-party services are performed in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We enter into contracts with these third parties that provide the data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes and that the recipient will provide the same level of protection as Pendo. We have certain liability under Privacy Shield if both (i) the provider processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
B. Legal Reasons: We share personal information outside of Pendo if reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or enforceable governmental requests; (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Pendo, our customers, or the public as permitted by law.
C. With Consent: Pendo does not sell your information and will not use customer data for any reason beyond those described in this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. 
Where does Pendo store my personal information?
Data submitted to Pendo, and Pendo’s application, are hosted and stored in a secure, multi-tenant environment provided by Google’s Cloud Platform. Data is stored for each customer using separate Google AppEngine namespaces, and a variety of techniques for logical separation, to ensure that no data is co-mingled. Currently, the Google physical architecture that hosts Pendo is located in the United States. By submitting information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Is the personal information secure?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
All data hosted by Pendo is encrypted.  Pendo uses industry-accepted encryption products to protect data at rest, with 256 bit AES encryption. All data transfers within the data center are secured by SSL.  All of the Customer Data collected by Pendo is transmitted over SSL if the customer application is accessed via SSL. The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.
How does Pendo use my personal information?
We use data of our Customers and their End Users to provide agreed upon services. We may also use customer data in an aggregated and anonymized form for our own purposes related to the performance and maintenance of the service, documentation of value provided, and marketing purposes. Such use may include subscriber data used in testing, but confidential or private data must be  masked or replaced before loading to a Test environment.  Any use of unmasked subscriber data in testing must be appropriately authorized in writing by the customer.
Pendo does not use data that identifies a customer for marketing or advertising without explicit consent.
What personal information can I access?
Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:

name and password
email address
company name
location or time zone

The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@pendo.io. We will respond to your request to access within 10 days.
Some international users, whose personal data is within the scope of Privacy Shield, have certain legal rights to access certain personal data we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment, or deletion. Those users may exercise some of those rights by contacting compliance@pendo.io as described in the Privacy Shield section of this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that (because Pendo has limited ability to identify an individual’s End User Customer Information data submitted by our customers), we will refer your request to the Customer who submitted your personal data and support them as needed in responding to your request.
Testimonials: We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. To request removal of your personal information from Testimonials or comments please contact us at support@pendo.io.
How long does Pendo keep my data?
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services in accordance with Pendo’s Terms of Service. You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at support@pendo.io. Please note that some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from your account. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. 
If a request to delete End User Customer Information is received by Pendo directly from a data subject, we will log the request for tracking, but will not confirm the request until approved by our customer.
What choices do I have?
You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features. You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained in the section above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. 
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@pendo.io. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes or changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will by posting an announcement on our Website. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.
Questions or Concerns
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message at support@pendo.io. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.

Actionable user data.  In-application feedback.  No coding required.
Pendo helps product managers uncover and attack what truly drives their product success








Product management insights from our blog






Product Trials and Data Tribulations

For many, product data during the trial period is feast or famine. They’re either overwhelmed with data, making it difficult to condense actionable insights, or they don’t have access to even the most basic session-level data.
Read article








The Rise of Product Leadership

Let’s not refer to a product manager as a generalist, a Swiss Army knife, or “CEO of a product.” Instead, let’s refer to product manager as a product leader. Because inspiring leaders are what we aspire to become.

Guidelines for Feature Releases

In-app messaging tools give you the ability to announce features. But rollouts can still be challenging. In this post, we’ll look at strategies for taming the complexity of feature rollouts, and getting value to your customers quickly and smoothly.
Read article






Product data helps to identify super users and early adopters
“When we release a new feature, I want to know how it’s being adopted and who the early adopters are, so we can reach out for feedback. The beauty of Pendo is that if you don’t tag something now, you can always go back later and tag it.”

Read the Full Story











Stop guessing and start knowing
Stop deciding what to build based on what you think users are doing — decide based on facts. Use real customer usage data to inform roadmap decisions and prioritize features that really help your business grow.


















Get incredibly relevant feedback
Reach users “in-the-moment” by gathering feedback directly in your application. Target your outreach to only survey users who have actually used the feature or capabilities you’re asking about.

About







We deliver product success
Pendo was founded in 2013 when alumni from Rally, Google, Cisco, and Red Hat combined their heads and hearts to build something they wanted but never had as product managers — a simple way to understand and attack what truly drives product success.
With powerful analytics, in-application user feedback, and contextual guidance designed to help companies measure and elevate the customer experience within their applications, Pendo is on a mission to improve society’s experience with software.
Proudly built in North Carolina but engineered to scale globally without losing that soul.
