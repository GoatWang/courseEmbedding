About | Tinybop











































Toys for tomorrow
We grew up playing with toys that activated the most colorful realms of our imaginations. Our blocks were skyscrapers and galaxies — whatever we wanted them to be.
We’re creating elegant, educational apps to spark the curiosity of kids around the world today.
In our apps, kids play and learn by diving into big ideas, seeing how things work, and making connections about the world they live in.



Built with care
We conduct thorough research and collaborate with subject experts to get the facts right. We work with celebrated artists to create vibrant illustrations. And we engineer intelligent animations for delightful, dynamic experiences.
We support kids and parents playing and learning together with kid-friendly designs and extras for grownups, including dashboards, handbooks with tips, and ideas to further learning.




By former kids



Raul Gutierrez, Founder and CEO, hopes to build a company where ideas, design, and engineering come together to delight, inspire, and educate children.






Youngna Park, COO, connects the dots between artists, educators, writers, designers, and engineers to bring Tinybop’s apps to life.






Robert Blackwood, Senior iOS Engineer, is a software architect and entrepreneur who finds inspiration in creating artificially intelligent systems and physical simulations.






Sara Distin, Editorial Consultant, takes care of all the words you read around Tinybop’s universe.






Jessie Sattler, Technical Artist, translates all the tiny pieces in an artist’s illustrations (more than 3,400 for Plants!) into working parts for the dev team.






Ashley Mannetta, Research Lead, scopes the facts — for both big concepts and little details — that inform Tinybop’s apps and handbooks.






Yin Liu, Unity Engineer, loves working with code to bring ideas to life. She enjoys expressing creativity through programming.  






Leah Feuer, Head of Product, springs Tinybop’s apps into being by uniting the ideas, code, art, and whimsy of a talented team.






Brian Jacobs, Sound Designer, creates and collects the sounds that inhabit our apps. He also composes and sings Tinybop tunes.






Holly Graham, Technical Artist, dissects and assembles artwork alongside the engineers to create aesthetically-pleasing interactive worlds.






Kristen Murphy, Education Research Associate, is a former Brooklyn public high school teacher. Her relationship-building and organizational super powers align all the stars at Tinybop.






Alejandro Palmero, Unity 3D Developer, loves using math to make things move and opening windows into new worlds in apps.






Matthew Tribe, Consulting CFO, loves seeing how numbers tell the stories of what we've done and what we can do.






Russell Savage, Senior iOS Engineer, is a software architect who develops open source libraries and enjoys creative coding of all kinds.






Nneka Bolden, Product Manager, unites her children's media experience with a little heart, soul, and a magical team to make our apps ready for the wild.






Eden Wall, Education Lead, applies her background in child development to help design and build useful products for schools.






Matt Jacobs, Front-end Engineer — and occasional designer — enjoys working at the intersection of art and technology.






Jeanelle Mak, Senior Designer, stretches the bounds of the Tinybop brand and makes sure everything feels and looks right.






Beckie Choe, Junior Designer, pushes pixels together to bring Tinybop ideas to life.






Maayan Eldar, User Research & QA Manager, makes sure our products are friendly, playful, and ready for the world.






We’re good company
And we’re looking for a few good people to join our team. If you love pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with mobile devices, spinning interactive stories, and collaborating on creative projects, you’ll fit right in.
