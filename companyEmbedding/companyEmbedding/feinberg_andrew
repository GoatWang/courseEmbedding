on June 30, 2016 









It is December 2015 and Abe Lincoln has come back to life in New York City for two weeks. He befriends 13-year-old Henry Mason, son of a Lincoln scholar, who helps him understand that his mission is to repair a warped political system and ease the social civil war that still simmers in the nation. Crazy? Impossible? Perhaps, but there is a more immediate problem. The 2016 presidential campaign has traumatized voters. Truth is having a brutal season. Lincoln is horrified by Ronald Crockenstock, the racist, coonskin-haired founder of the pay-toilet colossus Pay as You Go, who leads the Republican field, and his irredeemably despicable rival, Fred Arrogandez, a senator who denies the scientific explanation for everything. “We had idiots in my day,” Lincoln says, “but yours are bigger.” Together, Lincoln and Henry battle appalling candidates, a noxious hedge fund billionaire, Fox News reality twisters, violent mobs, demonic pastors and the political establishment. Does Lincoln have time to accomplish his goals? Can he escape the dozens of assassins on his trail? If Lincoln fails, will America slide into the abyss?

Did you know that sometimes products malfunction and cause injury?Manufacturers and product designers have a responsibility to the public to create safe products. However, it is not a perfect world, and sometimes defective or poorly designed units make it to market.Following is a list of defective products:Car seats. Evenflo recalled 3.4 million car seats in 2001 after realizing the handle on the seats was faulty and capable of unexpectedly releasing and flipping over.Kellogg: In 2002, Kellogg recalled 730,000 Pop Tart packages because they forgot to declare that eggs were in the ingredients. Every ingredient must be listed to protect individuals who have specific allergies.Disney. In 2003, Disney recalled thousands of Woody dolls from the film “Toy Story” because the toy contained small buttons that posed a choking hazard.Cell phone batteries. There has been recent debate as to whether cell phone batteries are harmful. Nokia thought so in 2007, and recalled 46 million handsets because they discovered that the units were overheating.Medication. Many medications are safe. Yet a large number of others cause side effects that can cause injury or death. Merck recalled the arthritis drug Vioxx in 2004 because the medication was causing heart attacks and strokes in some patients. If any type of product causes you injury, it is in your best interests to consult with a lawyer about seeking fair compensation for your damages.   By  Robert I.

If you need to explore your options for filing a products liability lawsuit, you can turn to us.Companies are liable when they sell dangerous productsManufacturers have a responsibility to make reasonably safe products for consumers, but that’s not always the case. The following are the most common reasons for defective products:Poor manufacturing process. Defects in the manufacturing process are unfortunately a common occurrence. A poorly made component — such as nails, screws or clamps — can cause a product to completely fall apart, while a tainted batch of a food or beverage item due to unclean facilities can make many people sick.Dangerous designs. Companies are sometimes too quick in introducing products to the marketplace, overlooking major design flaws that put consumers at risk. When these items do not function as they should, serious injury may result.Lack of proper warnings. If a product has the potential to cause harm, manufacturers have a responsibility to provide adequate warnings to consumers, such as when companies sell items containing dangerous chemicals without notifying users about the potential hazards.Failure to recall. Sometimes companies know that their products are unsafe, but the cost of conducting a full recall would be higher than any potential lawsuits. In these cases, it’s important to hold manufacturers accountable for their negligence — for both you and others who could also be injured.What is strict products liability?In most cases, your attorney needs to examine the reason why a product was defective in order to secure a verdict for a client. However, in strict products liability cases, you and your attorney simply have to prove that a defective product injured you, and reason behind the defect is irrelevant. The goal of strict liability claims is to recover compensation for injuries and not to pursue punitive damages of any kind. Be sure to ask your Boston lawyers about strict products liability and if it applies to your case.Speak with an experienced product liability attorney in BostonNo one expects to be injured by a defective product, so be sure to work with a lawyer who knows these issues and can help you seek compensation from negligent parties and insurance companies.

Analysis
The restaurant of the future
Creating the next-generation customer experience
How can restaurants appeal to the next-generation customer who is demanding a customized, digital experience around every corner?








											Perspectives
											

												The power of employee engagement
											

												In an industry plagued by high turnover, cultivating employee engagement can help restaurants develop and retain good workers, create positive customer experiences, and reduce costly turnover.
											





											Press releases
											

												Deloitte survey: Creating the next-generation customer experience for restaurant companies
											

												A new Deloitte report uncovers the options that restaurant customers want most—such as online ordering, payment flexibility, and customization—and how these increase dining frequency, check size, customer conversion, and loyalty.
