PETROZENE is made from a byproduct of recycled petroleum-based products, so it will not contaminate the oil reserve to which it is being applied. Furthermore, the process that creates PETROZENE helps reduce the worldwide problem that petroleum waste products pose to our environment every year. History: The discovery of PETROZENE began with a desire to solve the environmental hazards that various petroleum waste products pose to the environment. Freestone Resources, Inc. has worked with numerous industry partners to recycle these post-consumer materials, and utilize their byproducts in a proprietary way for the oil and gas industry. PETROZENE has many uses within the oil industry. Below are the applications that are currently available: Oil Tanker & Oil Tank Solutions: PETROZENE has been shown to be an effective dispersant of oil sludge buildup. The research efforts of Freestone Resources, Inc. and industry partners have shown it to be especially effective in large, long range oil tankers. With the proper amount of PETROZENE applied to each shipment of oil, they have produced results that show a dramatic reduction in oil sludge buildup on the bottom of the tanks. These same results have been shown in oil storage tanks as well. With the proper application of PETROZENE, costs and operational downtime due to cleaning can be cut dramatically for each. Oil Well Enhancement: Freestone Resources, Inc. has also done thorough research concerning oil well enhancement with the application of PETROZENE. Freestone has discovered that a minimal amount of PETROZENE utilized down the wellbore will dissolve and further inhibit Paraffin and asphaltene buildup in the well casing. This buildup of paraffin causes other problems such as clogging up lines, pump failures, pressure bursts, and seal failures which can all be dramatically reduced with the proper application of PETROZENE. Pipeline Solutions: Numerous independent studies have shown that a minimal amount of PETROZENE decreases the viscosity of heavy oil. These tests indicate that PETROZENE can be utilized in pipelines that transport heavy oil in order to increases their efficiency and flow rate. We are currently researching many other uses and applications. If you or your company feel there may be a unique application within your business or would like to work with us to create a specific solution, feel free to contact us.   Petrozene Web Site; http://www.freestoneresources.com/petrozene/

Quote:Petrozene is good product.   Perhaps.  But not good enough to warrant it's price-tag, or it would have sales.   It's either over-priced for what it does or doesn't do what it's supposed to.   Either way the market doesn't want it.  (You can add in a "yet" if you'd like, but that's a matter of conjecture.)

(BW) Freestone Resources, Inc. Unveils Petrozene Marketing Campaign


Business Editors, (c) 2007 Business Wire


        Published 2:15 pm, Thursday, February 22, 2007
    



































































FAIRFIELD, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Freestone Resources, Inc. (FSNR.PK) is proud to unveil the initial marketing campaign for our Petrozene treatment line. Petrozene, formerly called NR206, is a revolutionary product, previously unavailable to the Oil and Gas Industry. Freestone is the exclusive world-wide provider and distributor for this new technology. This product has been thoroughly tested and displayed unparalleled results in solving several key oilfield and refinery problems. The unique performance of Petrozene, combined with our aggressive marketing campaign, will rapidly move this product into the forefront of the Oil and Gas Industry, and quickly generate a new dependable long-term revenue stream for our company.

Petrozene is a unique blend of organic compounds combined with specialized solvents that are designed to prevent and eliminate paraffin buildup. Paraffin buildup is an industry-wide, multi-billion dollar problem that occurs when paraffin crystals within the oil base combine into a waxy buildup. This problem is especially prevalent in cooler climates. The resulting wax constricts production & strains equipment, causing losses from lowered production efficiency and increased maintenance costs. In some cases, the buildup can fully incapacitate oil operations. Petrozene is particularly effective in removing these types of sludge, paraffin and other wax based deposits.
There are many methods for dealing with paraffin buildup in the industry, however none are as clean and cost effective as Petrozene. Unlike other products in the industry, Petrozene is an environmentally friendly, non-contaminating additive. Petrozene facilitates the dispersion of the paraffin crystals, and since it is also a dispersant, it serves to retain the paraffin in the oil phase. Further, treatment with Petrozene requires little or no costly downtime or halt in production. It is simply used as an additive to the oil base, and can be applied at any convenient point in the production process. Tests have shown that Petrozene can optimally be applied to any surface equipment where accumulations of paraffin occur, as well as added into flow lines and down hole. Other specific uses include: removal of tanker sludge during transport, tank bottom cleanup, back washing filters, and to proactively aid in cleanup during well work over operations.
A key use example of Petrozene is its use in oil tankers. During the transport of oil, the tankers accumulate a vast amount of oil waste buildup, which costs millions of dollars in cleanup fees and downtime. This cleanup must be done multiple times a year. Along with the oil, Petrozene can be added to the oil tankers prior to transport and will reduce, even eliminate, the need for such costly cleanups.
Freestone, as well as independent researchers, have put Petrozene through extensive testing and have accumulated a vast amount of technical data that confirms its performance and cost effectiveness. To date, Petrozene has been used in approximately 20 oil storage tanks to aid in the removal and extraction of accumulated tank bottom sludge. With proper application and treatment, these tests have shown Petrozene to be one hundred percent effective in clearing tank bottom sludge and allowing for the sale of previously unusable oil.
Petrozene has also shown unbelievable results in treating shallow oil wells with paraffin restriction in the production tubing or in the perforated formation. After treating over 25 wells, Petrozene has been shown to produce up to 400% increase in oil production in these wells, with an average of a 200% increase in barrels of oil per day per well. The potential market for Petrozene is huge. In the state of Texas alone, there are over 40,000 producing oil wells that could benefit from Petrozene. We expect the future domestic market to be very lucrative, especially due to the recent remarks made by President George W. Bush during the 2007 State of the Union address, calling for the U.S. oil industry to âœstep up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive waysâ (see State of the Union 2007).
Petrozene is now being actively marketed by authorized sales representatives placed in key markets throughout the United States and abroad. Freestone has recently signed agency agreements for sales agents in California and Texas, and is directly engaging potential clients in Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and Libya. We are primarily focusing on solutions for tank bottoms, high paraffin oil wells, oil transport and refineries. Our agents have already contacted dozens of potential end-users and have distributed hundreds of gallons of sample product for operational tests and lab analysis.
Freestone Resources has retained a marketing firm to conduct the worldwide campaign for Petrozene. This aggressive campaign begins today with the launch of Petrozene.com. The website, www.petrozene.com, discusses the origins and history of Petrozene, introduces its uses and test data, and allows potential clients to contact sales representatives for consultation and purchase. All interested parties should visit the site to keep up-to-date on details and for sales and product information.
Petrozene is a primary focus for us and we are dedicating significant resources to push this innovative product into new markets. We are anticipating several large orders within the next few weeks, based on positive feedback from our initial test clients. Freestone Resources has been contacted and has had conversations with two of the major oil companies as well as numerous independent oil companies and chemical companies about the product. We expect to have contracts in place with some of these contacts within the next two weeks. At this time, it is premature to make economic projections for the sales of Petrozene, but we anticipate that by fourth quarter 2007 Freestone Resources shareholders should expect to see a substantial net profit from this new and exciting revenue stream.

This consistent supply will provide opportunities to accept long-term contracts for large volumes of Petrozene sales. The technology will also produce other byproducts of value that can result in additional revenue streams. Kevin McNulty, CEO of Dynamis Energy said, "We are very pleased to partner with Freestone Resources and excited about the opportunity to combine our technology expertise with Freestone and it's revolutionary Petrozene product.
