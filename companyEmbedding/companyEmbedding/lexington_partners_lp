            Lexington Partners is one of the world’s largest and most successful independent managers of secondary private equity and co-investment funds. Since 1990, principals of Lexington Partners have organized 18 secondary funds and 9 co-investment pools with total capital of $35 billion.

            Principals of Lexington Partners helped pioneer the development of the institutional secondary market more than 27 years ago and created one of the first independent, discretionary co-investment programs over 19 years ago. Today, Lexington Partners has:
        


                Acquired over 2,400 secondary interests through more than 400 secondary transactions with a total value in excess of $36 billion, including $12 billion of syndicated transactions  
            

                Invested $4.1 billion in over 240 co-investments alongside more than 125 sponsors
            

                Committed more than $1.6 billion to over 325 primary funds 
            


            Lexington’s success is based on the experience and stability of our professional team. Lexington currently employs more than 100 people in six offices globally.

Lexington’s 25 partners and principals each average over 19 years of alternative investment experience and more than 14 years together at Lexington. The firm’s partners and principals are supported by investment professionals skilled in the evaluation and analysis of global secondary, co-investment, and primary opportunities, and by a reliable team of investor relations, fund accounting, and fund administration professionals.
        

            Lexington believes that private equity and alternative investment sponsors have the ability to enhance their long-term performance through an understanding of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues affecting their portfolio companies. Lexington has a responsible investment policy, is a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and acts as a good steward of investors’ capital by collaborating with our diverse portfolio of sponsors regarding ESG best practices.

NEW YORK, April 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexington Partners ("Lexington"), the largest independent manager of secondary acquisition funds, today announced the final close of Lexington Capital Partners VIII, L.P. and associated vehicles ("LCP VIII") at $10.1 billion.  The fund, which commenced investing in 2014, accepted commitments up to its hard cap and is the largest dedicated secondary acquisition fund ever raised, significantly exceeding Lexington's prior secondary fund, LCP VII, which closed on $7.1 billion in 2011.  Lexington has also established an innovative $1.75 billion credit facility which provides LCP VIII additional transaction flexibility.
LCP VIII will acquire global private equity and alternative assets through a full range of negotiated secondary market transactions including: portfolio acquisitions, balance sheet spin-outs, equity co-investments, hedge fund private equity purchases, and fund recapitalizations.  LCP VIII also has the ability to invest in new private investment funds. 
LCP VIII has been formed with commitments from over 300 investors, concentrated among major public pensions, corporate pensions, and sovereign wealth funds in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and the Middle East.  Insurance companies, endowments, foundations, family offices, and high net worth investors also subscribed, with existing investors contributing a majority of the fund's capital.
Commenting on the fund closing, Brent Nicklas, Managing Partner of Lexington, said, "We are grateful for the strong support of our existing and new investors who have chosen to commit significant capital to LCP VIII.  Our high-quality global investor base and the substantial capital they have entrusted to Lexington will enhance the fund's secondary capabilities with global counterparties and sponsors."
Lexington has committed approximately 30% of LCP VIII's capital, investing in six transactions with banks and financial institutions, five transactions with fiduciaries, one hedge fund transaction, and a fund restructuring.  The majority of LCP VIII's committed transactions have been sourced exclusively by Lexington.
Secondary industry volume in 2014 was the highest on record with over $35 billion of completed transactions, a level that is expected to be surpassed in 2015 with projected volume of $40 billion or more.  The pipeline of transactions stemming from regulatory-driven selling by banks and financial institutions, more active management of alternative investment allocations by fiduciaries, and GP-led fund restructurings, suggest that the secondary market will continue to grow significantly in the years ahead.
"Today's secondary market is increasingly characterized by transaction diversity, complexity, and scale.  Over a long period of time, Lexington has developed the proven execution experience, counterparty reputation, breadth of sponsor relationships, and strength of capital to provide differentiated and innovative solutions to investors seeking to rebalance their alternative investment portfolios.  With the successful capitalization of LCP VIII, we look forward to continuing our leadership of the global secondary market," said Mr. Nicklas.

Lexington Partners Closes Lexington Middle Market Investors III at $1.070 Billion

		  - Innovative Fund Targets Middle Market Interests in Global Secondary Market -
		

Jul 07, 2014, 12:04 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Lexington Partners 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, July 7, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexington Partners ("Lexington"), the largest dedicated manager of secondary acquisition funds, today announced the final close of Lexington Middle Market Investors III, L.P. ("LMMI III") at $1.070 billion. The fund, which is the third in Lexington's specialized middle market series, significantly exceeded its $750 million target. 
LMMI III will acquire interests in growth capital, small, and middle market buyout funds in the global secondary market. LMMI III also has the ability to help facilitate the spin-out of established private equity teams from banks and financial institutions, and to invest in new middle market funds.
LMMI III has been formed with commitments from over 50 limited partners, concentrated among major public and corporate pension funds in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Global endowments, foundations, and high net worth individuals also subscribed, with existing investors contributing a majority of the fund's capital. 
Commenting on the fund closing, Brent Nicklas, Managing Partner of Lexington, said, "We are pleased that so many existing Lexington investors chose to commit significant capital to LMMI III. Together with our newest investors, we look forward to building upon these important relationships during the life of LMMI III." 
Lexington estimates that industry-wide over $23 billion was invested in secondary transactions in 2013, a level that is expected to be surpassed in 2014 with projected volume of $30 billion or more. Heightened regulation of global banks and financial institutions together with more active management of private investment allocations by fiduciaries, suggests that the secondary market will continue to experience significant volumes and growth in the years ahead.
Lexington has already committed 40% of LMMI III's capital, investing in four transactions with banks and financial institutions, three transactions with pension and sovereign wealth funds, and three transactions with asset management firms. Eight of LMMI III's committed transactions have been sourced exclusively by Lexington.
"Lexington Middle Market Investors has quadrupled in size since we began the program 10 years ago. The strategy is innovative because it allows large investors, interested in efficient middle market exposure, to benefit from favorable secondary market opportunities and Lexington's strong relationships with middle market sponsors," said Mr. Nicklas.
Separately, Lexington also recently announced the formation of Lexington Emerging Partners, L.P. ("LEP"), a $150 million managed account, to acquire young middle market buyout interests in Asian and Latin American funds. 
Including LMMI III and LEP, Lexington has approximately $25 billion of committed secondary capital. Lexington's secondary funds have acquired over 2,000 secondary interests through 350 transactions with a total value in excess of $27 billion, including $10 billion in syndications.
