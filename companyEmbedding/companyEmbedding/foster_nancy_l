                                            Aunt Nancy was just like a grandmother to me.  She was a second mother to my mom and a very special person.  What I remember the most is that she was as honest as anyone could imagine.  What made her special is that she was caring and loving.  To the family, what this shows us is that we should cherich every moment, Carpe Diem", and ceize the moment.  No one knows what the future brings so enjoy those you love, let them know you love them, and show them in every way that you love them.  Aunt Nancy I love you and I appreciate the support you gave to my mother in her times of need.  Family, I love you and know that Aunt Nancy no longer has to suffer and she is in a better place.  She is smiling on and watching over all of us and you know she is dancing in the heavens.

                                            Aunt Nancy, you have always been my "second mom", raising me until Ruby and Dibbo came and took me.  I love you and will miss you dearly, but I know that you are in heaven now watching over me.  I thank you for being there for me always and giving me the strength and courage to fight my bout with breast cancer.  You are a jewel and I want to live a long and beautiful life like you, always caring and looking after others.  I am looking forward to seeing you in that great getting up morning on the other side where every day will be joyfu; and full of praise to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Love and kisses, Vickie Ann

Sharon,I'm sorry I didn't get the opportunity to meet your Mom. But, after becoming aquainted with you through my sister and your friend, Dessa, your Mom had to have been a beautiful christian lady. That character shines through you. You and your family are in our prayers and thoughts. Let the peace of God, which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Remember, you can do all things through Christ which strengthens you,(Phil. 4:13)
Thank God for the precious memories you have of Mom!

With Love,
Laura

Dear Family,

	Please accept my heartfelt condolences on death of your mother, Sis. Nancy L. Foster.  We offer our prayers that you will find the strength to sustain you through your pain and sorrow.  Someone one said, upon the death of a loved one, “God finally caught his eye.” Your mother was God’s good and faithful servant.  Always active.  Deeply devoted.  Sincere in every word and deed.  God finally caught her eye and beckoned her home for a well-deserved, eternal rest.  My you find comfort in knowing that your mother now walks and talks with God.

You are in our prayers

I would go over saturday mornings and watch cartoons and have breakfast with her and mama Suzie. She always told me to stay out of trouble and thanks to her I can say that I am a good person. I will miss her so much, but I know that she is watching over me.
