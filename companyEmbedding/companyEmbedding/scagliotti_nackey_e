Nackey Scagliotti Is Named E.W. Scripps Chairman






The Associated Press




Mar 18, 2009 12:00 PM EDT













 
















































 CINCINNATI (AP) ¿ Media company E.W. Scripps Co. said Wednesday that Nackey Scagliotti, a great-granddaughter of the company's founder, will become chairwoman of its board, succeeding William Burleigh. Scagliotti will replace Burleigh, who is retiring after serving nearly a decade as chairman, on May 5. Scagliotti, 63, has served on the board since 1999. She is also a trustee of The Edward W. Scripps Trust. Until last December, she served as chairwoman of Union Leader Corp., a Manchester, N.H.-based newspaper publisher. She was assistant publisher of The Union Leader newspaper from 1996 to 1999. Burleigh, a Scripps director since 1990, has also held the titles of chief operating officer, president and chief executive. He first joined the company's corporate headquarters in 1984 after serving as editor of Scripps newspapers in Evansville, Ind., and Cincinnati, Ohio. The leadership change comes at a challenging time for the company. Scripps was forced to shutter the nearly 150-year-old Rocky Mountain News in Denver in February after the newspaper lost $16 million last year. The Rocky Mountain News is the largest newspaper to fail so far amid an industrywide downturn that has led to widespread downsizing and layoffs. Last month, Scripps posted a fourth-quarter loss of $12.6 million, dragged down by lower revenue and impairment charges. Scripps shares gained 10 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $1.60 in midday trading. The stock has traded between 67 cents and $10.26 during the past 52 weeks.

Nackey Scagliotti, chairwoman of The. E.W. Scripps Co., will retire after the company's annual meeting on May 1, the company announced today. Scripps owns the News Sentinel and the Memphis Commercial Appeal. The Cincinnati-based media company said the board's nominating committee has recommended that CEO Rich Boehne be named to replace Scagliotti as chairman. Scagliotti is a great-granddaughter of the company's founder. She has been chairwoman since 2008. Scripps also announced that Kelly Conlin, chairman and CEO of NameMedia, has been nominated as a director. NameMedia, a privately-owned company, operates a global e-commerce platform for buying and selling domain names. Scripps is expected to release its 2012 fourth quarter financial report Tuesday before the market opens. Scripps owns newspapers in 13 markets and 19 television stations.
