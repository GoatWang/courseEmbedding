                   Bank Stock Investment Specialists and Shareholder Activists
For over 20 years, PL Capital has specialized in investments in publicly traded U.S. banks/thrifts which are undervalued and in need of a catalyst to improve performance and enhance shareholder value.
The principals of PL Capital, Rich Lashley and John Palmer, each have over 30 years experience in the banking industry.  PL Capital utilizes shareholder activism (e.g. board representation, proxy contests, shareholder proposals, etc.) to seek improvement in the performance, capital structure and corporate governance of the banks/thrifts in which it invests.  Where needed, PL Capital will advocate for changes in the strategic plan of a bank/thrift in order to enhance and/or maximize shareholder value.
The PL Capital investment partnerships strive for long term capital appreciation and are generally tax efficient (long term capital gains).

       About Us
PL Capital, LLC (“PL Capital”) was formed by Richard Lashley and John Palmer in 1996 to focus on the banking industry. Messrs. Lashley and Palmer have devoted their entire professional careers to the banking and financial services sector, initially through their experience at KPMG LLP, the world’s leading provider of professional services to the banking and financial services sector, in the 1980’s and early 1990’s, and then with PL Capital since its founding in 1996. PL Capital focuses on publicly traded U.S. banks and thrifts with market capitalizations ranging from $50 million to $3 billion. PL Capital is one of the few investment firms in the U.S. which utilizes shareholder activism to improve the performance and strategic direction of the banks and thrifts in which it invests.
The principals of PL Capital strongly believe the banking industry is an attractive area in which to invest. As any casual observer of the national and local business news knows, the banking industry is consolidating. This trend, which began in earnest in the early 1990’s, is the result of the U.S. being severely overbanked. The U.S. still has approximately 6,200 banks and thrifts, far more than the amount needed to serve the public and businesses efficiently. This consolidation trend has created significant investment opportunities for investors, such as PL Capital, who have the appropriate industry expertise to identify and value potential takeover candidates and undervalued financial institutions.
In order to capitalize on this opportunity, in January 1996 PL Capital formed its first private investment partnership, the Financial Edge Fund, L.P. (“the Partnership”). The Partnership invests primarily in publicly traded and privately placed equity and debt securities of banks, thrifts and other financial services companies. PL Capital subsequently launched the Financial Edge-Strategic Fund, L.P. in 1998, Goodbody/PL Capital, L.P. in 2000 and the PL Capital/Focused Fund, L.P. in 2004 (collectively, the “Partnerships”). In 2016, PL Capital formed the PL Capital Plus Fund, L.P. to focus on consolidation in the large community and regional bank space. The Partnerships are available to qualified individuals, corporations, pension plans, IRAs, Keoghs and trusts.

Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should contain between 70 and 160 characters (spaces included).Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique, straightforward meta description that contains most important keywords. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the user’s search query (See the Google Preview below).Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.

Great, your website is structured using HTML headings (<H1> to <H6>).Use your keywords in the headings and make sure the first level (<H1>) includes your most important keywords. Never duplicate your title tag content in your header tag.While it is important to ensure every page has an <H1> tag, only include more than one per page if you're using HTML5. Instead, use multiple <H2> - <H6> tags.

Add the important keywords in <H> headings

Alternative text allows you to add a description to an image. Since search engine crawlers cannot see images, they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query. Alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a Google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired users.It looks like you're missing alternative text for 1 images on plcapitalllc.com. Check the images on your website to make sure accurate and relevant alternative text is specified for each image on the page.Try to minimize the number of alt text characters to 150 or less (including spaces!) to optimize page load times.

Links pass value from one page to another. This value is called 'link juice'.A page's link juice is split between all the links on that page so lots of unnecessary links on a page will dilute the value attributed to each link. There's no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under 200.Using the Nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice, but these links are still taken into account when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so using lots of NoFollow links can still dilute PageRank.

A robots.txt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories. They also point the web crawler to your page’s XML sitemap file.Your site currently has a robot.txt file. You can use Google Search Console's Robots.txt Tester to submit and test your robot.txt file and to make sure Googlebot isn't crawling any restricted files.

We checked plcapitalllc.com but couldn't find an XML sitemap.XML sitemaps contain the list of your URLs that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently. They can also include information like your site’s latest updates, frequency of changes and the importance of URLs.Your site is currently missing an XML sitemap. We recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Normally, your XML sitemap would be found at plcapitalllc.com/sitemap.Make sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl, so leave out any that have been blocked in a robots.txt file. Avoid using any URLs that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred URLs (with or without www.), correct protocols (http vs. https) and trailing slashes. You should also use your robots.txt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap.

Add and Optimize your XML sitemap






















                                      URL Parameters
                                    







      Good, the URLs look clean.
      
    


?

                                    URL parameters are used to track user behaviors on site (session IDs), traffic sources (referrer IDs) or to give users control over the content on the page (sorting and filtering). The issue with URL parameters is that Google sees each unique parameter value as a new URL hosting the same thing - meaning you could have a duplicate content problem. Sometimes, it’s able to recognize these URLs and group them together. It then algorithmically decides which URL is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results. You can help Google recognize the best URL by using the rel=”canonical” tag.Use the URL Parameters Tool in Google Search Console to tell Google how your URL parameters affect page content and how to to crawl URLs with parameters. Use this tool very carefully - you can easily prevent Google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings, especially if you have URLs with multiple parameters.
                                    
                                
Rewrite your URLs and clean them up.

Hard to solve





      Great, you are not using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs.
      
    


?

Great, you aren't using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores aren't recognized. So the search engine sees www.example.com/green_dress as www.example.com/greendress. The bots will have a hard time determining this URL's relevance to a keyword.

Great, you aren't using Flash or frames on your site.While it often looks nicer, Flash content can't be properly indexed by search engines. Maximize your SEO efforts by avoiding Flash.Search engines also have problems with frames because they can't crawl or index the content within them. Avoid them if you can and use a NoFrames tag when you can't.

Your domain is the human-readable address of your website on the Internet. How long your domain name has been registered does have a limited impact on your rankings in search results. The newer your domain the harder it can be to achieve a higher rank. To help offset this, consider buying a second-hand domain name.Do you know that you can register your domain for up to 10 years? By doing so, you will show the world that you are serious about your business.

Keep your URLs short and clean and avoid long domain names when possible.A descriptive URL is better recognized by search engines. A user should be able to look at the address bar and make an accurate guess about the content of the page before reaching it (e.g., http://www.mysite.com/en/products).Keep in mind that URLs are also an important part of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Use clean URLs to make your site more "crawlable" by Google™.Resource: Search for a good domain name. If no good names are available, consider a second hand domain. To prevent brand theft, you might consider trademarking your domain name.

Great, your website has a favicon.



?

Favicons are the small icons that appear next to your site’s name or URL in a browser. They can be displayed in the address bar, a browser tab title or bookmarks. Make sure it is consistent with your brand.Here is a way one company used a special favicon to improve user experience.

Two of the main reasons for an increase in page size are images and JavaScript files. Large page size contributes to slow page speeds so try to keep your page size below 2 Mb.Tip: Use images with a small size and optimize their download with gzip.
