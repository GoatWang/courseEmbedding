Gender

Male











                    Hank J. Ratner is president and chief executive officer of The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG), which includes renowned performance venues, entertainment properties, professional sports teams and television networks. Mr. Ratner directs the overall strategy and day-to-day operations of the business. He also serves as alternate governor to the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League on behalf of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers.
The Company’s signature assets consist of some of the nation’s most dynamic and powerful sports, media and entertainment assets and brands. This diverse collection of properties includes a portfolio of iconic venues: New York’s Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and Beacon Theatre; The Chicago Theatre; the Forum in Inglewood, California; and the Wang Theatre in Boston. In addition, MSG owns and operates professional sports teams, the New York Knicks, Rangers and Liberty; MSG Entertainment and its entertainment properties, including the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, featuring the legendary Radio City Rockettes; regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG and MSG+; and Fuse, a national music network.
In February of 2010, Mr. Ratner led the spin-off of Madison Square Garden from Cablevision Systems Corporation and, today, The Madison Square Garden Company is a thriving, stand-alone, public company. Currently, Mr. Ratner is spearheading the Transformation of the iconic Madison Square Garden Arena, which will significantly enhance the experience of customers, athletes, entertainers, suite holders and partners. The project will ultimately feature a dramatically redesigned Seventh Avenue entrance, new seats, improved sightlines, new Event Level and Madison Level suites, two new one-of-a-kind bridges suspended above the playing surface, and spectacular public concourses. The Transformation will also showcase new food offerings by some of the best chefs in the world, pay homage to the building’s storied history and include the restoration of The Garden’s distinctive and celebrated ceiling.
Mr. Ratner served as MSG’s vice chairman for seven years before being named president and chief executive officer following MSG’s spin-off from Cablevision. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Ratner has been influential in formulating and implementing the strategic direction for MSG’s multi-faceted business. For example, he has played a key role in bringing some of the country’s landmark venues under MSG management. Over the last six years, these have included The Beacon Theatre, The Chicago Theatre, the Wang Theatre and, most recently, the Forum. In addition, Mr. Ratner is the architect of the company’s integrated business approach, designed to capitalize on MSG’s unique combination of iconic venues, sports and entertainment content, and programming and distribution networks, by strategically aligning these assets to work together to deliver incomparable opportunities and exceptional experiences for partners, entertainers, customers and fans.
As chairman of The Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit that works closely with The Madison Square Garden Company, Mr. Ratner has been the visionary behind the charity’s commitment to “make dreams come true for children facing obstacles.” Its extraordinary relationship with the company, allows the Foundation to do what no other charity in the world can do – use the magic and power of MSG’s assets to create on-going, unforgettable programs that improve kids’ lives. Since its inception in 2006, Garden of Dreams has worked with all areas of MSG – including the Knicks, Rangers, Liberty, MSG Media and MSG Entertainment – to create thousands of unique and unforgettable experiences that have brightened the lives of more than 200,000 children.
Mr. Ratner has also served as vice chairman of Cablevision Systems Corporation since 2003. In this role, he helps to set corporate direction and strategy for the media and telecommunications company whose portfolio of operations includes a full suite of advanced digital television, voice and high-speed Internet services, and valuable local media and programming properties. Prior to serving as MSG and Cablevision vice chairman, Mr. Ratner served as COO and then vice chairman of Rainbow Media Holdings, Cablevision’s former programming subsidiary which became AMC Networks, a separate company, after its spin-off in June 2011.
Mr. Ratner joined Cablevision as assistant general counsel in 1987. A year later, he moved to Rainbow Media, rising to the position of Rainbow’s chief operating officer in 1998. Mr. Ratner was then promoted to vice chairman of Cablevision before also being named vice chairman of MSG in 2003.
Previously, Mr. Ratner was an associate with the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. He received a bachelor’s degree and doctorate of law with distinction from Emory University. [+]

      EXCLUSIVE: Sons of former MSG CEO Hank Ratner accused of assaulting woman at Manhattan nightclub  EXCLUSIVE: Sons of ex-MSG boss accused of assault   BY  Shayna Jacobs  Barry Paddock   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, April 24, 2015, 2:30 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          Hank Ratner stepped down as CEO of Madison Square Garden last year. His two sons were accused of assaulting a woman at a nightclub last fall. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)       BY  Shayna Jacobs  Barry Paddock   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, April 24, 2015, 2:30 AM    
	Two sons of former Madison Square Garden CEO Hank Ratner allegedly assaulted a woman during a wild brawl inside a Meatpacking District nightclub last fall, the Daily News has learned.

	The mayhem began when a woman refused 29-year-old Scott Ratner’s advances inside plush hotspot The Gilded Lily on W. 15th St., about 2 a.m. on Oct. 18, prosecutors said immediately following the incident.

	Scott Ratner, who works as an associate at a law firm, allegedly smacked a 27-year-old woman at the lounge in the face, fracturing her jaw, according to court papers. Prosecutors during the brothers’ arraignment later that day in Manhattan Criminal Court described the victim as a friend of the woman who spurned him.

	His brother, Michael Ratner, 25, then joined the fracas, prosecutors said. He was initially charged with strangulation for choking a woman until she felt faint. But that charge was dropped and he is now accused of shoving the woman his brother allegedly smacked to the ground, causing her to suffer several bulged discs in her back.

	Both brothers appeared to be drunk at the club, prosecutors said. 

	“Scott has already resolved his case without any criminal offense and, based on the evidence, Michael is seeking a dismissal,” their lawyer Jim Walden said Thursday.

	Scott Ratner was initially accused of hitting another pal of the woman he was pursuing in the side of the head with a glass bottle, sending her to the hospital with a deep cut to her ear. But a felony assault charge against him was later reduced.

	“The people no longer believe the defendants committed a felony and therefore this case should be prosecuted as a misdemeanor,” prosecutors said on Nov. 17.

	Bob Vilensky, a lawyer for the alleged victim, said she doesn’t want to comment but “continues to suffer both physical and psychological issues as a result of the incident.”

	In his initial court appearance the day of the brawl, Scott Ratner’s lawyer said his client was the one hit in the head with a glass object and noted he had cuts all over his face.

	“We’ve contacted several witnesses who say that our clients did not strike anybody,” said attorney Thomas Rotko, who represented the brothers at their arraignment. “In fact, they were the victims of this assault.”
      Michael Ratner, 25, is also accused of joining the brawl, although his lawyer says he was rushing to his brother's aid. (Facebook)   



	Michael Ratner, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who runs a production company according to his lawyers, appeared briefly in Manhattan Criminal Court Thursday. He wore a white dress shirt unbuttoned at the collar and dark slacks and sported a close-cropped beard.

	“Last October, Scott Ratner was viciously attacked by a perpetrator who smashed a glass in his face. This attack caused deep lacerations around Scott’s eyes that required emergency medical attention,” Walden said Thursday. “Scott’s brother Michael, who was a bystander to this attack, came to his aid to ensure Scott received the medical treatment he required.”

	Hank Ratner stepped down as president and CEO of Madison Square Garden last year after overseeing a $1 billion renovation of the famed arena.

	He and the boys’ mother were in the courtroom to support the sons’ during their October arraignment before Judge Bruce Allen. Both brothers were released on $5,000 bail and gave police an Old Westbury, L.I. address upon their arrest.

	Scott Ratner took a plea deal on April 9, pleading guilty to harassment and agreeing to pay more than $4,000 in restitution and perform 10 days of community service. The harassment conviction is a violation, not a crime.

	Michael Ratner is due back in court June 8.
