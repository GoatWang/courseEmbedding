• "Painting a Picture"  Like a landscape painter, investors need to envision the whole picture before it is fully painted and realize that it’s never static, writes Michael Wilson, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Morgan Stanley & Co. He advises adapting to recent changes by adding exposure to some asset classes that have lagged this year but should do better as the cycle matures. • “Climbing the Last Wall of Worry”  S&P For the past six months, improving growth and contained inflation helped push asset prices higher, writes Andrew Sheets, chief global cross-asset strategist for Morgan Stanley & Co. As he expects improving growth and contained inflation for the next six months, asset prices should continue their run.   • “10 Reasons to Doubt Legislative Optimism on Tax Reform”  MS & Co. Strategist Michael Zezas still thinks some form of tax reform will happen, but not as quickly as some press reports and leading Republicans say it will. Zezas lays out his reasoning.
