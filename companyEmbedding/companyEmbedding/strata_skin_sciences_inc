STRATA Skin Sciences













































A new company built by unconventional thinkers. A medical technology company that brings hope and help to the dermatology patient in all of us. It’s not just a device or a technology. It’s optimism for psoriasis. Determination for improving patients’ lives. Advocacy for getting it right.



This is STRATA Skin Sciences.  And this is where dermatology is headed.




















When the diagnosis is psoriasis or vitiligo the treatment is clear. XTRAC.
						

							For decades, dermatologists have used ultra-violet light therapy for the effective and safe treatment of many skin disorders, including psoriasis and vitiligo.The XTRAC medical engineers and research teams, in coordination with Rox Anderson, M.D. at Harvard Medical School and Wellman Center of PhotoMedicine in Boston, created XTRAC to produce a monochromatic wavelength (308nm) of ultraviolet light known to positively impact the psoriasis and vitiligo healing processes.
						

























Skin has an even chance with VTRAC.
						

							Using a precise wavelength excimer lamp the VTRAC system is designed to treat vitiligo patches quickly and effectively. Because it concentrates light on patches, VTRAC allows health care professionals to deliver the high therapeutic doses necessary for rapid clearing without risk to healthy skin.
						

























Exceptional Results with Patient Safety Guaranteed.

						STRATAPEN™ MicroSystems provide advanced technology that offers exceptional results for many clients. While there are several different microtherapies, all STRATAPEN™ MicroSystems are being specifically marketed for the intended use of micropigmentation.
						
















THE HYBRID EXPERIENCE

						Introducing the Nordlys Hybrid System. The most complete versatile skin solution on the market. Handcrafted in Scandinavia and featuring 15 FDA-Cleared treatments, the Nordlys Hybrid Experience is the choice of the world’s most progressive and proven physicians.
						

						For more Information, Please send an email to  nordlys@strataskin.com

More Hope In A Jar? The Anti-Aging Skin Care Promise – CharmTell

Posted on July 5, 2017 by JenniferMore Hope In A Jar? The Anti-Aging Skin Care Promise 

WebMD investigates the newest crop of anti-aging skin care ingredients ― Do they work?
 




From magazines and newspapers to web pages and online blogs, it is hard to miss the promises being made for products designed for beauty and skin care. And the most tantalizing promises of all? Those that touch not just our vanity, but also our fears of growing old.
It’s an approach that seems to be working. According to Euromonitor International, anti-aging products now account for close to 9.8 billion dollars of the skin care market. That’s a nearly 109% increase since 1997.
But is the drive to deliver on the promise of still more hope in a jar bringing us any closer to finding the fountain of youth? The answer, it seems, depends on whether you are looking for a trickle or a gusher.
“A lot of satisfaction has to do with the condition of your skin before you start an anti-aging treatment,” says NYU Medical Center dermatologist Sumayah Jamal, MD. If you have pretty much never used anything on your face, she says, you are probably more likely to see results simply because you are doing something for your skin.
And that observation, in fact, may explain at least some of the reported differences in effectiveness ― differences recently highlighted in a Consumer Reports investigation. Researchers found the current crop of anti-aging creams fall short of delivering on their promises ― a conclusion shared by at least some doctors.
“Many of these products are claiming changes in the skin that would automatically classify them as drugs,” says NYU professor and dermatologist Rhoda Narins, MD. “And they are not [drugs]. So it’s clear they likely can’t do all they say they do.”
But is it possible that the upcoming crop of skin care “miracles” may actually be closer to delivering miraculous results? Some doctors believe there are intriguing possibilities on the horizon.
Theantioxidant anti-aging promise
One of the major ways skin ages is through a loss of collagen. Collagen is a naturally occurring substance that helps keep skin looking plump, lifted, and line-free. Although Jamal says we lose some collagen because of the natural aging process, an even greater amount can be lost through environmental assaults, particularly sun exposure and pollution.
These exposures, Jamal tells WebMD, increase the rate at which a natural cellular process occurs ― one which releases molecules called “free radicals” into the skin. The link to aging? Free radicals attack and destroy collagen. When left unchecked, Jamal says, free radicals destroy the skin’s support structure, and without that support, skin sags. Eventually, wrinkles form.
That is one reason why the up-to-the-minute ingredient generating the loudest anti-aging buzz right now is antioxidants ― nutrients that attack and disable free radicals before they have a chance to destroy our collagen supply. Some may even help increase natural collagen production.
Ken Beer, MD, director of Palm Beach Esthetic Center and author of Palm Beach Perfect Skin, tells WebMD, that if the products are well designed, a level of antioxidants can be achieved that may have wide-ranging effects, including attacking free radicals. Other experts agree and say antioxidants disable free radicals, reducing or even reversing collagen damage. That means younger looking skin.
But is it just wishful thinking ― or a promise we can count on?
Although research on topically applied antioxidant green tea showed it has strong anti-inflammatory and even anti-cancer properties, an 8-week medical study conducted at Stanford University was disappointing from a cosmetic perspective. The study failed to demonstrate anti-aging effects.
More promising, however, were studies conducted, by David McDaniel, MD, of the Eastern Virginia College of Medicine on a number of other antioxidants. Specifically, McDaniel looked at the protective capacity of several topically applied antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, kinetin, alpha-lipoic acid, and idebenone. While all showed some benefits to the skin, McDaniel found idebenone to be the clear leader of the pack.
A powerful micronutrient related to CoQ10, (another natural defender against cell damage) idebenone appeared to also provide a strong defense for skin. “Clinical studies thus far have shown that idebenone…quench[es] inflammatory reactions and… is a powerful antioxidant that destroys free radicals,” McDaniel recently told the Dermatology Times.
According to dermatologist Bruce Katz, MD, however, many women cannot tolerate idebenone products. “It can cause redness and irritation in some women that makes it difficult to use,” says Katz, director of Juva Skin and Laser Center in New York City. He advises women with sensitive skin to check with a dermatologist before trying products containing idebenone.
There is still a lack of overwhelming evidence to show that, for humans, topical use of this or any antioxidant can actually halt the aging process of the skin. But McDaniel believes that as manufacturers increasingly apply pharmaceutical standards to testing and developing products, the necessary data may soon become more prominent.
The coffee berry craze
Some of the testing may have already paid off for an ingredient derived from the little known fruit called the “coffee berry” that some now hail as the strongest antioxidant ― and possibly the most powerful anti-aging ingredient ― to date.
The same plant that bears the fruit of your Starbuck’s buzz, may also add a kick to your complexion. “Coffee berry,” says Beer, “is becoming popular, and it does contain high levels of antioxidants.” He goes on to say that clinical trials are now underway that may show it is a significant advance.
Coffee berry was introduced to doctors at the 2007 American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting, and many believe it shows real promise.
“[It’s] arguably the hottest thing out there now,” says Joel Schlessinger, MD. Schlessinger, who is president of the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Esthetic Surgery, tells WebMD there is a current study showing coffee berry “has higher antioxidative properties than any product ever tested ― including green tea and idebenone.”
While experts are hopeful that these antioxidant properties may translate into anti-aging effects on the skin, we won’t know for certain until the study is published sometime in the coming year. (At publication, WebMD was unable to confirm details of the study or its precise publication date.) Meanwhile, consumers may weigh in a lot sooner.
The first coffee berry product ― a skin cream called Revale ― has already hit the market with more from other companies on the way. And coffee berry won’t be alone on the shelf. A number of other new and unique antioxidant cocktails sit poised and ready to steal the thunder.
One is Estee Lauder’s new “Future Perfect” line, boasting a “skin recharge cocktail” that offers the anti-aging protection of an antioxidant known as NDGA that occurs naturally in the body. Recent studies have shown that, when applied topically, it may act somewhat like estrogen, helping to prevent the loss of collagen in skin.
Clinique’s Continuous Relief Antioxidant Moisturizer boasts eight antioxidants. At least one ― Eukarion-134 ― supposedly has the unique ability to recycle itself after each free-radical hit. This is significant because most other antioxidants lose their protective power after attacking and disabling a single free radical molecule. By recycling itself, this new antioxidant keeps on working, continuing to fight the damage that leads to aging, for a longer period on the surface of skin.
But are these and other antioxidant advances enough to guarantee anti-aging results?
Not all experts agree. According to Beer, “The degree to which any product works depends partly on the ability of the ingredient to get to the right place, which means it has to penetrate into the skin.” He believes that level of penetration is possible with the right combination of ingredients. And so, he says, some anti-aging effects are possible.
Narins, however, points out that without published clinical trials, it is impossible to know for certain. “With no FDA approval of these [ingredients], and no agency overseeing the claims, it’s impossible to know if a product does what it says it does,” she says. “And my guess is that most don’t.”
The tripeptide trifecta
Bearing a slightly more scientific pedigree are ingredients known as “peptides.” The frenzy actually began several years ago when the National Institutes of Health funded studies on wound healing. These studies showed that a chain of five peptides could instruct the body to ratchet up collagen production in response to wounding. More recently, smaller studies found that when applied topically, this same peptide chain seemed to respond to aging, collagen-deficient skin as if it were wounded and so encouraged collagen production.
While the level of activity is still under debate, the next generation of this technology ― known as tripeptides ― is already here.
“These are designer peptides,” says Beer, who describes them as “groups of amino acids” that inhibit some of the natural enzymatic ― and yes, aging ― processes that break down and destroy critical components of youthful skin, including collagen. “By providing stability for these and other critical components,” Beer says, “[tripeptides] tip the scales in favor of remaining more youthful and less damaged.”
Lumene, a Scandinavian company exporting moderately priced skin care to the U.S., is counting on that. They combine tripeptides with the antioxidant properties of sea buckthorn oil, for their new Premium Beauty line ― with research they claim proves it works.
The much more costly Osmotics Anti-Radical Age Defense Line offers a tripeptide formula that not only has antioxidant properties, but also claims to stimulate collagen production.
Narins continues to site a lack of published medical data. Schlessinger is even more blunt. “Cosmeceuticals can do some wonderful things for the skin,” he says, “including diminishing brown spots, improving texture, and making the skin feel smooth again. But filling in wrinkles ― I don’t think so.”
Until published medical studies do surface, it may be up to consumers to decide for themselves if even the cosmetic results have merit.
DNA repair and younger skin
One more class of products offering new hope in a jar takes the sci-fi approach of tinkering with DNA to turn back the clock one molecule at a time. One such product is called “Remergent.” Sold through doctor’s offices, Remergent reportedly works by delivering to cells small packets of enzymes with the capability of repairing DNA. When DNA, the basic component in all living cells, is damaged ― whether by too much sun exposure, or through the chemical assaults of pollution ― cells undergo changes that can result in anything from accelerated aging to disease, including cancer. The company’s website points to several published clinical studies they say document their product’s ability to control or even reverse DNA damage.
But while Beer is certain the technology is possible, he is less sure it is here. “None of these (studies) correlate the reversal of any age related symptoms or of any skin cancer treatment with their ingredients,” he says. “So while I believe that the technology for DNA repair holds great promise, I am awaiting evidence to convince me that it comes in a bottle.”
Jamal is even more skeptical: “In order for DNA repair to occur, the effect has to take place in the nucleus of the cell ― and my question is, are the agents able to affect nuclear processes [in your skin] as well as in the dish in the lab?”
Perhaps time ― and more research ― may answer that question.
So in the meantime . . . what’s a girl to do?
“Stay out of the sun, wear sunscreen, keep skin well moisturized,” says Jamal. And, she says, use anything that you believe makes a difference. Much like beauty, in the end, the look of youth may be in the jar of the beholder.
The beautiful HGTV star Joanna Gaines recently launched a skin care company last year and has kept quiet about her successful stint as CEO. Now that she’s proven herself to be a success she’s decided to leave the “Fixer Upper” show.
Joanna admits she purposely avoided publicly announcing her decision to leave the show because she wanted to make sure her new company could stand on its own two feet.
 
“I was worried people would just associate my new company with my TV show, and I felt as though that was be a huge disservice to the company. The products we produce really are life-changing and they deserve to be recognized on their own merit,” Joanna explained.
 
The product she’s talking about is the Anti-Aging Skin Cream which has taken the world by storm.
 
The product is repeatedly selling out within minutes and Joanna says her number one struggle as CEO is sourcing enough products to be able to adequaltey service the demand.
 
“We’re forever selling out. Whether its in stores or online, whenever we re-stock our customers buy out all the products within minutes.”
 
The scintillating success hasn’t come easy and Joanna admits she spent years of hard work behind the scenes perfecting the products.
 
“I wanted to be able to offer the public a healthy and safe alternative to plastic surgery. Not only is plastic surgery a very risky option, but it’s also not financially achievable for many Americans.”
 
Joanna says she was determined to create topical treatments that people could apply in the comfort of their own homes, that would boost their self-esteem and help them feel good about themselves.
 
It appears as though her products have done just that, with numerous celebrities jumping on board and singing Anti-Aging Skin Cream’s praises.
 
“I use the Anti-Aging Skin Cream myself and a few of my friends started asking me what was responsible for the huge change in my skin. Word started spreading that way and before I knew it, we had amassed a huge celebrity clientele.”
Miranda Lambert Has a Little too Much to Drink? You Won’t Believe What She Spilled About Gwen Stefani!
 
E!– Ever since Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton got a divorce back in 2015, Miranda has struggled to move on from the ‘God Gave Me You’ Country sensation. Since then, Miranda and Blake both have new partners. Blake is now engageed to No Doubt lead, Gwen Stefani. And Miranda’s new boyfriend is musician Anderson East. Although Blake seems to be happily in love, it’s been obvious that Miranda hasn’t had the same luxury.
Miranda has subtly been trying to sabotage Blake and Gwen’s relationship by spreading rumors, running into Blake at inconvienent times, and sending him old pictures and messages from when they were married. However, Miranda has really stirred the pot this time! Will Blake ever forgive her?
Miranda has reportedly been drinking a lot more than usual, and she has been caught out in public, belligerently drunk, spewing off Blake’s deepest secrets, along with Gwens. Turns out, Miranda was out at a bar last weekend, when paparazzi showed up just in time to catch her sobbing and screaming about Blake and Gwen.
“You guys have no idea what Gwenny looks like under ALL THAT MAKEUP! Did you know she’s almost 60? And she can’t credit that to her good genes, that’s for sure!”
When this incident hit the tabloids, Gwen was furious! Sources say that Gwen called up Miranda and screamed at her, while Blake tried to calm her down. Not only did Miranda embarrass herself, but she also revealed Gwen Stefani’s best kept secret. And when Gwen realized there was no going back, she decided to explain to her fans what Miranda was babbling about.
 
Gwen told E! News that she has indeed been using an anti-aging system to keep her youthfulness. However, she wanted to make sure everyone knows that she formulated this system herself along with top-of-the-line dermatologists. Gwen was not planning on launching her SkinCare line under next year, while she wasn’t so busy. But now that the cat is out of the bag, Gwen says that there is no better time.
Meryl Streep’s Shocking Plans to Marry Co-star Robert Redford!
Meryl Streep and Robert Redford shock the world with plans of getting married after years of keeping their relationship a secret. Meryl Streep tells GH editors “Robert and I have never stopped loving each other, ever since meeting on the set of Out of Africa, our careers just got in the way. Now we’re ready to go public and finally tie the knot! “
At 67, it seems like Meryl Streep has stopped aging. Despite her age, Meryl has been looking much younger and more radiant than ever! Many have tried to discover her secret: Is it botox, facelifts, or just makeup?
A few weeks ago on the Dr. Oz show, he shared the secret behind his celebrity clients who want to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Meryl Streep came on the show & went into detail on the products Dr.Oz has her use & how it has saved her career. We were so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was, we had to test it ourselves and write a feature article on the results! He explained how it not only saved Meryl’s career, but other celebrities’ whose careers were at risk due to their age, shockingly enough it’s a simple trick you can try too! The truth is out now & we have the inside scoop!
The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of
 
Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for his high paying celebrity clients until recently. He said he felt like he had to let his viewers know because he was tired of hearing the countless stories of his viewers throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago he shared the simple solution he had previously only shared with his celeb clients to everyone watching his show!
 
He actually discovered this anti aging miracle when multiple celebrity friends and clients were constantly reaching out to him hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.
On his show he said he was thrilled when after months and months of painstaking tests and research, his team came across a product that when used daily, literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and cost next to nothing!
