In a sense, “aggregate public opinion can play the role of the activist investor,” the researchers write. At the same time, according to the paper, investors have become more likely to buck recommendations from management and proxy advisors. “Boards have to pay some attention to the mood of the general public,” says Reena Aggarwal, co-author of the paper and a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

Ownership Structure and Initial Public Offerings

 World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 3103

Reena  Aggarwal Georgetown University - Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business Leora F. Klapper World Bank; World Bank - Development Research Group (DECRG)

Date Written: July 17, 2003

Abstract
Aggarwal and Klapper study the relationship between ownership structure, corporate governance, and the initial public offering (IPO) process. They examine equity ownership by different institutions, such as foreign and domestic financial institutions, banks with and without lending relationships, venture capitalists, and corporations prior to an IPO. The authors also analyze the relationship between ownership structure and corporate governance. They use a unique dataset of 152 Indian IPOs during the period 1999-2001 to analyze ownership of shares by main groups of shareholders. The authors find a relationship between ownership structure and firm-specific factors such as sales, leverage, and profitability, and IPO characteristics such as percentage of equity locked up, gross proceeds, and exchange of listing. There is also a strong relationship between ownership by different types of institutions. Ownership is also tied to bank lending relationships. Finally, the authors find strong relationships between ownership types and corporate governance. For example, firms with foreign investors are more likely to have an outside chief executive officer and offer an employee stock option plan.  This paper - a product of Finance, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to study international corporate governance.
