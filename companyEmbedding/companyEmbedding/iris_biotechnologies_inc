Company History

Iris BioTechnologies was established in 1999 by its Founder and CEO, Simon Chin, to fill the void that presently exists in our medical care system - the quick and accurate ability to categorize patients according to their genomic profile. From the beginning, Iris's goal was to produce a reliable clinical breast cancer chip that predicts which treatment protocol is the most effective for every breast cancer patient. 


Iris has focused on developing robust, accurate and reliable products for the clinical market. Three reputable university professors, through a six-month research project, independently validated our key technologies. The Nano-Biochip gene expression system was created and designed to more precisely diagnose and identify actionable treatment choices at the time of the initial tissue biopsy. The significant advantage of early prognosis determination and clinical intervention is to reduce medical costs and to improve the patient’s quality of life. The proprietary Nano-Biochips are designed to be FDA-approved kits, which can be used in any certified clinical laboratory. 


Until now, most physicians have made medical decisions based solely upon generic professional knowledge and treatment experience, with little or no insight into the molecular nature of their patient’s disease. Since the monumental achievement of sequencing the human genome, progress in molecular biology has opened the door to uncovering the molecular portraits of disease. The information provided by Iris Biotechnologies will help improve medical decision making in a way that will revolutionize the practice of medicine. 


With its multiple patents, cost-effective parallel processing technologies, and key business relationships in the US, Europe and Asia, Iris BioTechnologies is well positioned strategically and structurally to launch its first product, a BreastCancerChip™. Other Chips in our pipeline will include the Human Organ Transplant (HOT™) Chip, NeuroChip™, CardioChip™, and MetabolicChip™ for human use, and specialized and proprietary chips for veterinary, agricultural, and environmental applications. Further growth is expected for drug development, stem cell research and evolving clinical applications from growth in the Iris proprietary analytical BioWindows™ database.

The BioWindows™ Cancer Analysis and Prevention Project


















Iris BioTechnologies has launched BioWindows™ 2.0, a diagnostic and prognostic system that determines the most appropriate therapy based on genomic, family history and extensive lifestyle information for the major diseases affecting the industrialized world.
