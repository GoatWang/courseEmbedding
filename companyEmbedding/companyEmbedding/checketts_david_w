Career[edit]
Checketts attended the University of Utah and later earned a master's degree in business administration from Brigham Young University. After graduation, he joined the Boston-based consulting firm of Bain & Company. At 28, he became president and general manager of the Utah Jazz, making him the youngest chief executive in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. He then spent a year as the general manager of NBA International, where he worked to increase the league's presence around the world.
He became president of the New York Knicks in March 1991, and in his four seasons as president, the team made it to the Eastern Conference Finals three times and went to the NBA Finals in 1994. The team set records for attendance, television ratings and revenue during his tenure, but the club failed to win the NBA Finals.
He went on to become president and chief executive officer of Madison Square Garden, the company that owns the New York Rangers, New York Knicks, New York Liberty of the WNBA, Madison Square Garden and the MSG television network.[1] In 1997, MSG acquired Radio City Music Hall. From 1998 to 2001, the Rangers failed to make the playoffs four straight seasons despite having one of the highest payrolls in the NHL.
In September 2001, Checketts founded SCP Worldwide, a consulting and investment service firm for sports teams. In 2002, SCP acquired SportsWest Communications, a syndicated broadcaster of college sports. In July 2004, SCP bought into Major League Soccer and established a team in Utah, Real Salt Lake, which began play in April 2005. On September 29, 2005 it was announced that SCP had officially signed an agreement to purchase the St. Louis Blues.
In 2009, Checketts was in an ownership group along with talk radio host Rush Limbaugh that was publicly linked to a potential purchase of the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League (NFL); after numerous NFL players objected to Limbaugh owning an NFL team,[2] Checketts dropped Limbaugh from the group and never made a bid for the team.[3]
Checketts was hired in 2011 to serve as a consultant for new Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores.[4] Checketts has been Chief Executive Officer of Legends Hospitality Management, LLC since January 2012.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Checketts is married to Deb Checketts and they are the parents of six children. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was featured in the book The Mormon Way of Doing Business.
In 2007, Checketts was called as president of the church's Yorktown New York Stake, succeeding Gary Crittenden.[6][7]
Checketts is chairman of the Advisory Board of the Clinical Neurosciences Center at the University of Utah Hospital
His son Spencer Checketts works as a Radio Host on the "The Big Show" on 1280 KZNS (AM). He is also an anchor of Gameday Coverage of Utah Jazz for 1280/97.5 The Zone, NBA Analyst for KJZZ-TV and Root Sports Utah.

Job Details
               College Sports by Charlie or CollegeCharlieis a hobby.  We have been a prep school athletics director for 36 years.  We believe that college athletics, particularly football, at the six power conferences have abandoned the "student-athlete" concept for the big bucks.  The education of the athlete is totally secondary to the commercial enterprise of big time college athletics programs.   We maintain the web site to let off some steam and as a way to interact with folks. It has been fun to receive comments from readers.  Some agree with our commentary and some get downright angry at some of what we publish.  (See Archives )  It is also fun to try and mimic the BIG GUYS who have college sites that are read each day by millions. Our purpose is to get our readers to at least think about some of the ideas we put forth.  Basically we have found that since we started in 2002, that the average college sports fan could care less about academic integrity.  They don't care if their favorite college athletes ever go to class or obtain a degree.  They don't care if the star wide receiver was in jail the night before the big game.  They just love the fun and pageantry of college football - and most are willing to spend lots of dollars to follow their team. We believe that the athletic philosophy of the Ivy League is the example that should be followed by the entire NCAA.  We also love the 120 NCAA members that make up the I-AA football division.  The big bucks have not corrupted them yet.
