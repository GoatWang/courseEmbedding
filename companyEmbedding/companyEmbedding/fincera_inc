					Full Description



Fincera Inc., formerly AutoChina International Ltd., incorporated on October 16, 2007, focuses on providing Web-based financing and e-commerce services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individuals in China. The Company's operations consist of two operating segments: the Internet-based business, and property lease and management business. The Company is focused principally on its commercial vehicle sales, leasing and support business, which provides commercial vehicle leasing solutions for SMBs in China's transportation industry. The Company has targeted the transportation industry for its Internet-based products, which are CeraVest, CeraPay and TruShip. The Company classifies its Internet-based businesses into three categories: financial services, payment and settlement, and e-commerce.Internet-based BusinessesCeraVest is the Company's peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform, through which the Company offers SMBs short-term, six-month financing. The platform's Website is www.qingyidai.com. Its loans are funded through CeraVest investors, which can invest in notes through the CeraVest platform, and by the Company for any remaining unfunded portion. CeraVest loans bear interest at approximately 8.62% per annum. The loan is guaranteed by the SMBs and over 8.5% of the loan is remitted to the Company as a security deposit. The Company also offers the CeraVest Flex product. CeraVest Flex allows investors to add or withdraw funds as they please. It transfers the underlying assets, which are CeraPay receivables, to investors through a transfer agreement at a quoted rate of approximately 8.03% per annum. The transferred notes have no specific lending period or maturity date.The Company adjusts the size of the underlying pool of CeraPay receivables according to the total amount of investment in CeraVest Flex. All of the foregoing is reflected in the applicable transfer agreements. No clauses in the CeraVest transfer agreements require the Company to repurchase any default loans. However, the Company voluntarily commits to assist the investors to eliminate investment risks, and retain the principal and the stated interest. The Company also voluntarily commits to repurchasing notes from investors that would like to withdraw their funds prior to loan maturity, after which the Company then relists these repurchased loans for sale to other investors. All investments received are secured by the same amount of the counterpart loans, net and other financing receivables the Company is due from the borrowers and the CeraPay users, respectively. The Company generates revenue from CeraVest primarily by charging origination fees and from interest on the loans the Company make.CeraPay is the Company's online payments platform that operates on its own closed-loop network. The platform's Website is www.dianfubao.com. CeraPay users are provided with a credit line that can be utilized at participating CeraPay merchants or be used to pay other CeraPay users. Having features similar to a credit card, there are no fees (other than late fees and penalties for CeraPay users that become delinquent on amounts borrowed) for using the CeraPay payments service as long as any outstanding balances are paid in full each month. The Company generates revenue from CeraPay primarily by charging transaction fees. Merchants can use CeraPay funds to make payments to other CeraPay users or merchants or cash out the funds through transfer to a bank account. CeraPay users are subject to an application and credit approval process and provide guarantees and collateral (which can include a commercial vehicle, a security deposit or real estate) before they are provided with a credit line. CeraPay, in conjunction with its third party payment partners, serves as the online payment method for all of its e-commerce platforms.TruShip is the Company's online e-commerce platform whereby trucking industry merchants, such as dealerships and leasing companies, can establish an online store-front and conduct sales transactions through CeraPay. The platform's Website is www.che001.com. The TruShip Logistics shipping marketplace is launched on the platform. It allows participants in China's fragmented long-haul trucking industry to publish, browse, and connect on shipping jobs across the country. Payment transactions resulting from connections made on TruShip Logistics can be completed with CeraPay, and the subsequent data is used as underwriting metrics for CeraVest loans to small businesses. The Company also operates a network of branch offices in over 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China. These branches support local sales staff for its Internet-based businesses.Property Lease and Management BusinessThe Company owns and leases out office space in the Kai Yuan Finance Center, which is an approximately 54-story large-scale commercial building with hotel, office and ancillary facilities, erected on a land parcel with a site area of approximately 10,600 square meters in the central business district of Shijiazhuang, China. The Company owns floors 5 to 11 and 13 to 27, which comprise a total gross floor area of approximately 62,970 square meters. Its corporate headquarters occupy floors 26 and 27 and the Company leases out the space that the Company does not occupy (approximately 56,090 square meters).

Income from continuing operations was $2.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $9.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.Operational HighlightsCeraPay and CeraVestOur first two internet-based businesses, CeraPay and CeraVest, experienced significant growth during 2016. As shown in the table below, transaction volume of CeraPay (our online credit advance and payment processing platform) and CeraVest (our online lending platform for small businesses) increased significantly during 2016 over the prior year.  (RMB in millions)   For the Year Ended                 December 31,   2016         December 31,   2015                   Amount         Amount         % Change         CeraPay Transaction Volume       22,390.1       9,699.2       130.8 %     CeraVest Loans Issued       4,708.3       2,625.9       79.3 %  CeraPay (https://www.dianfubao.com) allows customers to pay for their everyday needs at participating merchants through the online CeraPay transaction network.

Fincera earns transaction fees through its CeraPay platform. During 2016, CeraPay customers made payment transactions totaling RMB22.4 billion (approximately $3.4 billion), a 130.8% increase from RMB9.7 billion in 2015.CeraVest (https://www.qingyidai.com) provides an online lending marketplace that provides short-term operating capital for small and medium-sized businesses. CeraVest originates loans and sells these loans to the public. Currently, individuals may invest on the CeraVest platform and earn an annual interest rate of up to approximately 8.03% on a flexible term investment, or 8.62% for a 6-month investment if held to maturity.

It provides consumers in China with the ability to conveniently research and purchase passenger cars or maintenance services online. Similar to Fincera's TruShip Logistics feature, payment transactions resulting from connections made on AutoChekk can be completed with CeraPay, and the resulting data can be used by the Company as underwriting metrics for CeraVest loans to small businesses.Launched in July 2016, PingPing (www.pingpw.com) is an ecommerce platform for small businesses. PingPing provides businesses with an easy-to-use online platform to establish an online presence while providing an intuitive, full-service online shopping experience for their customers. PingPing plans to offer B2B, B2C, and real estate ecommerce services, which are all complemented by Fincera's core financial service offerings. As with the TruShip and AutoChekk platforms, payment transactions are processed using CeraPay and other third-party payment platforms, and the resulting data may also be used by the Company as underwriting metrics for CeraVest loans to small businesses.First Quarter 2017 Business Update    (RMB in millions)       For the Three Months Ended             March 31,   2017         December 31,   2016         September 30,   2016             Amount         Amount         Amount         CeraPay Transaction Volume       5,713.4       5,558.4       6,444.7       CeraVest Loans Issued       1,463.9       1,061.4       1,273.0    CeraPay was used to make payment transactions totaling over RMB5.7 billion ($829.4 million) during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately RMB155 million ($21.8 million) over the fourth quarter of 2016.CeraVest originated RMB1.5 billion (approximately $212.5 million) during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately RMB400 million ($58.1 million) over the fourth quarter of 2016.

Service charges, which represent CeraPay transaction fees, late payment fees and penalties, increased 123.1% to $71.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from $32.1 million in the prior year. Interest income, which represents interest earned on CeraVest loans, penalty and origination fees, increased 138.8% to $34.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from $14.2 million in the prior year. This was due to a significant increase in the aggregate amount of CeraVest loans facilitated by the Company in 2016.Property lease and management revenues totaled $25.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $26.4 million in the prior year, as a result of lower occupancy rates for the office leasing business. The average occupancy rate of the Kai Yuan Finance Center was 74% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 86% in the prior year. Operating Costs and ExpensesThe Company's operating costs and expenses increased by 51.3% to $128.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, from $85.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased interest expense and provision for credit losses, as well as increased product development expense, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses to support the growth of the Company's internet-based business.Income (Loss) from Continuing OperationsIncome from continuing operations totaled $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $9.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to the ramp-up of the Company's internet-based business.Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxesIncome from discontinued operations, net of taxes, totaled $165,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to the winding down of the legacy truck-leasing business.Net Income (Loss)Net income was $2.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share on 24.4 weighted average shares outstanding, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share on 23.6 weighted average shares outstanding, in the prior year. The increase was due to the growth of the Company's internet-based business.Balance Sheet ItemsAt December 31, 2016, Fincera had cash and cash equivalents (not including restricted cash) of $104.1 million, compared to $72.3 million at December 31, 2015.Total liabilities were $1.0 billion, and shareholders' equity was $22.6 million, compared to $671.1 million and $253.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Total liabilities increased significantly from 2016 to 2015 as a result of the growth in the CeraVest business. As the CeraVest business and the amount of investment received from investors has grown, the balance of borrowed funds from CeraVest investors has increased accordingly.Management CommentaryMr. Yong Hui Li, Chairman and CEO of Fincera, stated, "2016 marked the second full-year of operations for our internet-based business segment. I am pleased with the significant growth achieved in both our CeraPay and CeraVest platforms, with CeraPay's transaction volume more than doubling from that of 2015 and loans issued through CeraVest growing approximately 80% year over year. With this growth, our top line grew over 80% year over year, and we were able to generate a profit from our operations. To complement our two flagship products, we have continued to develop new ecommerce offerings to address the marketing and financing needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and in 2016, we launched AutoChekk for the passenger vehicle market and PingPing for small businesses. Leveraging our reputation and experience as a trusted partner in China's transportation industry, we have begun to make inroads into other industries with our suite of internet-based products and services. Not only do our offerings foster more opportunities for small businesses in China to grow to their greatest potential, but customers in China also benefit from access to information on more vendors and a convenient online-to-offline shopping experience. Through our extensive financial support network in China, we remain focused on serving small businesses and individuals in China and look forward to continue expanding our audience into the transportation industry and beyond in 2017."Currency ConversionThe translation of RMB amounts for CeraPay and CeraVest into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers and have been made at the rates listed by the People's Bank of China at the end of the period for amounts reported as of a corresponding period end (such as for CeraVest loan portfolio size), while transactional data over a period of time (such as CeraPay transactions) have been translated into USD at the average rates during the periods the transactions were recognized.About Fincera Inc.Founded in 2005, Fincera Inc.
