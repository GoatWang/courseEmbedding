Transcript

Corporations can be and should be a responsible part of society and we need to lead because of the number of individuals we have a tremendous impact on every day. So, our mission at Aetna is to build a healthier world. Our commitment starts with our own employees and when we look at our own employee population it looks much like employee populations do throughout the United States.
And what we've failed to realize is that in the current environment, our scarcest resource are our people. Business leaders are educated to husband scarce resources. And for a long time we've been convinced through our business schools that the scarce resource is capital. But with 1.7 trillion domestically and 2.1 trillion abroad, there's a lot of money to be had.
The real scarce resource is talent – an engaged work force. And, so, if we really are right about husbanding our scarce resources, we should be husbanding our human capital.
My challenge to the team was how can we as the purveyors of capitalism redefine the model that no longer works in our society? What should we do and what can we prove to us and other businesses, that there's a different way of leading and there's a different way of managing our businesses? 
So, what we've done is we've raised our employee base wage to sixteen dollars an hour with an average effect of eleven percent, but some folks getting 33 percent higher wages. 
Secondly, we said to folks, tell you what, we’re going to make you a deal. If you take care of yourselves, we’ll take care of you. Because when we looked at wage increases, we saw the elimination of benefits as a result of people having higher income. And so, our goal was, how do we raise people’s personal disposable income high enough so that they can enjoy the recovery in our economy? 
If there's ever a case to be made for total shareholder return on the part of business, is when you invest in your human capital, you build sound business fundamentals. And in building those sound business fundaments, you build a consistently repeatable and valued product that your customers buy over time.
Our business fundamentals were funded by our employees – our front line employees. They were the people who delivered our product. 
Our mission around building a healthier world is built on a premise that redefines what health is. Health creates productive individuals. Productive individuals are culturally, socially, spiritually, and economically viable and as a result they're happy. And if we can do that employee by employee, company by company, community by community, and nation by nation, wouldn’t we have a much more civil world to live in?

	The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have the responsibility of construing and interpreting the Plan and of establishing and amending such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or desirable for the proper administration of the Plan. Any decision or action taken or to be taken by the Committee, arising out of or in connection with the construction, administration, interpretation and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be within its absolute discretion (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) and shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and any person claiming under or through any Participant.





















	Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, and in addition to other express powers and authorizations conferred on the Committee by the Plan, the Committee election of the holder thereof or of the Committee; (vii) interpret and administer the Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or Award made under, the Plan; (viii) establish, amend, suspend, or waive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; and (ix) make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan (including authorizing another committee of the Board to designate Participants or make Awards under the Plan within limits prescribed by the Committee).




	 




	Except with respect to any action or adjustment taken in connection with a Fundamental Corporate Event, any amendment or action that would, directly or indirectly, reduce the exercise price of any outstanding option or SAR previously granted under the Plan, including through an exchange or cancellation of awards for cash or other awards, shall be subject to the approval of the Company’s shareholders.


















	SECTION 4.






	SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS.









	 




	 




	(a)


	    


	Shares Available for Issuance.


	 The maximum number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which Awards may be made under the Plan shall be a total of


	27,287,000


	,29,387,000


	 shares of Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock may be made available from the authorized but unissued shares of the Company or from shares held in the Company’s treasury and not reserved for some other purpose. In the event that any Award is paid solely in cash, no shares shall be deducted from the number of shares available for issuance by reason of such Award. Shares of Common Stock subject to Awards that are forfeited, terminated, canceled or settled, in whole or in part, without the delivery of Common Stock under the Plan will again be available for Awards under the Plan, as will shares of Common Stock tendered (either actually or by attestation) to the Company in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the exercise price of any Award under the Plan, and shares withheld by the Company to pay applicable withholding in accordance with Section 12.




	(b)


	    


	Adjustment for Corporate Transactions.


	 In the event that the Committee shall determine that any Fundamental Corporate Event affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is required to preserve, or to prevent enlargement of, the benefits or potential benefits made available under this Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of shares which thereafter may be awarded or optioned and sold or made the subject of Awards under the Plan, (ii) the number and kinds of shares subject to outstanding Awards and (iii) the grant, exercise or conversion price with respect to any of the foregoing. Additionally, the Committee may make provisions for a cash payment to a Participant or a person who has an outstanding Award; provided, however, that to the extent such an Award constitutes “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A, no such provision for a cash payment shall change the timing of payment of such Award unless such change is permitted under Section 409A. However, the number of shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.


















	SECTION 5.






	STOCK OPTIONS.









	 




	 




	(a)


	    


	Grant.


	Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to grant Options to an Eligible Employee and to determine (i) the number of shares to be covered by each Option, (ii) subject to Section 5(b), the exercise price of the Option and (iii) the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Committee grant any Participant Options (i) for more than 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of any year in which the Plan is in effect, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(b) or (ii) with a term of exceeding 10 years. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with Section 422 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.




	(b)


	    


	Exercise Price.


	 Except in the case of a Substitute Award, the exercise price of an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.




	 




	(c)


	    


	Exercise.


	 Each Option shall be exercised at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify at the time of the applicable Award or thereafter. No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option unless arrangements satisfactory to the Committee have been made to assure full payment of the exercise price therefor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payment of the exercise price may be made in cash or its equivalent or, if and to the extent permitted by the Committee, by exchanging shares of Common Stock owned by the optionee (which are not the subject of any pledge or other security interest or which, in the case of Incentive Stock, are fully vested) either actually or by attestation, or by a combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of





















	any such Common Stock so tendered to the Company, valued as of the date of such tender, is at least equal to such exercise price.









	(d)


	    


	Incentive Stock Option Annual Limit.


	 The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Eligible Employee during any calendar year (counting Incentive Stock Options under this Plan and under any other stock option plan of the Company or a subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000. If an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option is granted to an Eligible Employee and the Option may not be treated in whole or in part as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the $100,000 limitation, the Option shall be treated as an Incentive Stock Option to the extent it may be so treated under the limitation and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option as to the remainder. For purposes of determining whether an Incentive Stock Option would cause the limitation to be exceeded, Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order granted. The annual limit set forth above shall not apply to Nonstatutory Stock Options.


















	SECTION 6.






	STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.







	 




	 




	(a)


	    


	Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.


	 The Committee shall have the authority to grant Stock Appreciation Rights in tandem with an Option, in addition to an Option, or freestanding and unrelated to an Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Committee grant any Participant Stock Appreciation Rights (i) for more than 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock in respect of any year in which the Plan is in effect, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(b), and (ii) with a term exceeding 10 years (or the term of the underlying Incentive Stock Option in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option). Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at the same time as the Option or at a later time.




	(b)


	    


	Exercise Price.


	 The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right was granted; provided that if a Stock Appreciation Right is granted retroactively in tandem with or in substitution for an Option, the exercise price may be the exercise price of the Option to which it is related.




	(c)


	    


	Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights


	. A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the base price thereof. The Committee shall determine the time or times at which or the event or events (including, without limitation, a change of control) upon which a Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised in whole or in part, the method of exercise and whether such Stock Appreciation Right shall be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock;


	provided, however


	, that unless otherwise specified by the Committee at or after grant, a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option shall be exercisable at the same time or times as the related Option is exercisable.


















	SECTION 7.






	INCENTIVE AWARDS.









	 




	 




	(a)


	    


	Incentive Stock and Incentive Units.


	Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to grant time vesting and/or performance vesting Incentive Stock or Incentive Units to any Eligible Employee and to determine (i) the number of shares of Incentive Stock and/or the number of Incentive Units to be granted to each Participant and (ii) the other terms and conditions of such Awards; provided that, to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law, Incentive Stock shall only be awarded to an Eligible Employee who has been employed for such minimum period of time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Restricted Period related to Incentive Stock or Incentive Units shall lapse upon the passage of time and/or the determination by the Committee that the performance objectives established by the Committee have been attained, in whole or in part. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to any performance-based Awards of Incentive Stock and/or Incentive Units (whether payable in cash or shares) granted to an Executive Officer with respect to any year in which the Plan is in effect shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(b). If the award is intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the performance objectives with respect to an Award made to an Executive Officer shall be related to at least one of the following criteria, which may be determined solely by reference to the performance of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate (or any business unit thereof) or based on comparative performance relative to other companies: (i) net income; (ii) earnings before income taxes; (iii) earnings per share; (iv) return on shareholders equity; (v) expense management; (vi) profitability of an identifiable business unit or product; (vii) ratio of claims to revenues; (viii) revenue growth; (ix) earnings growth; (x) total shareholder return; (xi) cash flow; (xii) return on assets;





















	(xiii) pretax operating income; (xiv) net economic profit (operating earnings minus a charge for capital); (xv) customer satisfaction; (xvi) provider satisfaction; (xvii) employee satisfaction; (xviii) quality of networks; (xix) strategic innovation or (xx) any combination of the foregoing.




	 













	SECTION 8.






	OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS.









	 




	 




	The Committee shall have authority to grant to eligible Employees an “Other Stock-Based Award”, which shall consist of any right which is (i) not an Award described in Sections 5 through 7 above and (ii) an Award of Common Stock or an Award denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Common Stock (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Common Stock), as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan; provided that any such rights must comply, to the extent deemed desirable by the Committee, with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and applicable law. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-Based Award.


















	SECTION 9.






	DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.









	 




	 




	The Committee may provide that any Award shall include dividends or dividend equivalents, payable in cash, Common Stock, securities or other property on a current or deferred basis, including payment contingencies provided, however, in no event shall any such dividend or dividend equivalent become payable prior to the date on which an award is vested in accordance with its terms. The preceding sentence to the contrary notwithstanding, no dividends or dividend equivalents will be payable on options or stock appreciation rights.


















	SECTION 10.






	STOCK IN LIEU OF CASH.









	 




	The Committee may grant Awards in lieu of all or a portion of compensation or an Award otherwise payable in cash to an Executive Officer pursuant to any bonus or incentive compensation plan of the Company.













	SECTION 11.






	DEFERRAL.









	 




	 




	The Committee shall have the discretion to determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities, other Awards, other property, and other amounts payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the Participant or of the Committee. The timing of any elective deferral shall comply with Section 409A. At the time of any automatic or elective deferral, the time and form of payment shall be established consistent with the requirements of Section 409A. If the time or form of payment is not so established, the form of payment shall be a lump sum and the time of payment shall be the date the Participant experiences a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. Gains from the exercise of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be eligible for automatic or elective deferral.


















	SECTION 12.






	GENERAL PROVISIONS.









	 




	 




	(a)


	    


	Withholding


	. The Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant in cash (whether under this Plan or otherwise) any taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under this Plan. In the case of any Award satisfied in the form of Common Stock, no shares shall be issued unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the Company shall have been made to satisfy any withholding tax obligations applicable with respect to such Award.




	(b)


	    


	Award Agreement.


	 Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced in writing. The written agreement shall be delivered to the Participant and shall incorporate the terms of the Plan by reference and specify the terms and conditions thereof and any rules applicable thereto.




	(c)


	    


	Nontransferability.


	 Unless the Committee shall permit (on such terms and conditions as it shall establish) an Award to be transferred to a member of the Participant’s immediate family or to a trust or similar vehicle for the benefit of such immediate family members (collectively, the “Permitted Transferees”), no Award shall be assignable or transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and except to the extent required by law, no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the Participant. All rights with respect to Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by such Participant or, if applicable, the Permitted Transferees or the Participant’s legal representative.





















	(d)


	    


	No Right to Employment.


	 The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate. Further, the Company and each Subsidiary and Affiliate expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss a Participant free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, except as provided herein or in any Award Agreement.




	(e)


	    


	No Rights to Awards, No Shareholder Rights.


	 No Participant or Eligible Employee shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Participants and Eligible Employees. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award, no person shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan prior to the issuance thereof.




	(f)


	    


	Applicable Law.


	 The validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut.




	(g)


	    


	Effective Date.


	 The Plan shall be effective upon approval by the Company’s shareholders.




	(h)


	    


	Amendment or Termination of Plan.


	 The Board or the Committee may terminate or suspend the Plan at any time, but the termination or suspension will not adversely affect any vested Awards then outstanding under the Plan. No Award may be granted under the Plan after May 21, 2020 or such earlier date as the Plan is terminated by action of the Board or the Committee. The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by the Board, except that no amendment may be made without shareholder approval if the Committee determines that such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement, including any approval requirement which is a prerequisite for exemptive relief from Section 16 of the Exchange Act, for which or with which the Committee determines that it is desirable to qualify or comply; and, the Committee may amend the term of any Award or Option granted, retroactively or prospectively, but no amendment may adversely affect any vested Award or Option without the holder’s consent.




	(i)


	    


	Compliance with Legal and Exchange Requirements.


	 The Plan, the granting and exercising of Awards thereunder and the other obligations of the Company under the Plan, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the granting and exercising of Awards, the issuance or delivery of Common Stock under any Award or any other action permitted under the Plan to permit the Company, with reasonable diligence, to complete such stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of such Common Stock or other required action under any federal or state law, rule, or regulation and may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Company shall not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to recognize the exercise of any Award or to otherwise sell or issue Common Stock in violation of any such laws, rules, or regulations; and any postponement of the exercise or settlement of any Award under this provision shall not extend the term of such Awards, and neither the Company nor its directors or officers shall have any obligations or liability to the Participant with respect to any Award (or stock issuable thereunder) that shall lapse because of such postponement.




	(j)


	    


	Severability of Provisions.


	 If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included.




	(k)


	    


	Incapacity.


	 Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of providing a receipt therefore shall be deemed paid when paid to such person’s guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment shall fully discharge any liability or obligation of the Committee, the Board, the Company and all other parties with respect thereto.




	(l)


	    


	Headings and Captions.


	 The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of this Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of this Plan.




	(m)


	    




	Compliance with Section 409A.


	 All Awards granted under the Plan are intended to be either exempt from the requirements of Section 409A or, if not exempt, to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A. The provisions of the Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with such intent. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or an Award agreement to the contrary, the Company will not pay or accelerate the payment of any amount that constitutes “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A, in violation of Section 409A. To the extent any amount of “deferred compensation” as defined in Section 409A would otherwise vest and become payable upon a Change in Control or upon a disability, as set forth herein or in an Award Agreement, any such Award may vest but payment shall not be accelerated unless the Change in Control or the disability also satisfies the definition of “change in control” or “disability” as set forth in Section 409A.





















	Any amount that constitutes “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A and is payable under the Plan solely by reason of a Participant’s termination of employment shall be payable only if the Participant has experienced a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A, provided that if the Participant is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such separation from service, as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A, no payments shall be made before the six-month anniversary of the Participant’s separation from service, at which time all payments that would otherwise have been made during such six-month period shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum.
