Brad Elliott
Thanks John. Good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 Equity Bancshares earnings call. I'm Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO and here with me this morning is our CFO, Greg Kossover.
It has been a very exciting week in the Equity Bank franchise. The announcement of the mergers with Patriot Bank in Tulsa and Eastman National Bank in Ponca City in Newkirk, signals of entry into Oklahoma with two new outstanding banking partners. I'd like to say again how impressed we are with Michael Bezanson team in Tulsa and the team in Ponca City in Newkirk led by Mark Detten and Jim Leach.
We follow that great news today and with our record second quarter 2017 results. This performance is the result of very hard work and unselfishness of our teams here at Equity Bank. The teams at Hoxie, Grinnell and Quinter have now been with Equity Bank for a full quarter and has integrated nicely. Mike, Jeff, Sherry and Steve and their teams are already making an impact as deposits and have also increased 4 million in deposits since closing. And we're just as excited about the future of the Western Kansas markets, as we were when we introduced the Hoxie team to our franchise.
Also our operating teams in Wichita, once again made the process of integrating a new bank look easier than it is. Myself and our Board of Directors thank each of our hard-working teams for all you do every day which takes us back to our record quarter.
By closing and converting our mergers, at the same time the focus can turn immediately to integration and performance. In the second quarter that have lead to $6,354,000 in net income or $0.51 per share both records for Equity Bancshares.
For the quarter annualized return on assets was over 1% and return on tangible common equity was over 12.3% and our efficiency ratio was less than 60%. These metrics are the hard earned results from everyone at Equity Bank for our shareholders.

And as I have said in recent announcements, we've bolstered the teams with the addition of Wendell Bontrager's President Scott Smits as Chief Credit Officer and transitioned Julie Huber to lead Mergers and Integrations. The impact of these individuals and their teams allows Greg and I to - resources to continue to build our merger pipeline with opportunities in our footprint.
Before we go through our second quarter numbers, I want to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership in our journey. To serve as Chairman of the Board with these talented and diverse individuals is a privilege. Each of them brings something unique to the table and collectively they come together with hard work, passion, experience, and business acumen to deliver value and growth to our shareholders.
Thank you directors for all you do. Greg?
Greg Kossover
Thank you, Brad.
We begin with our earnings and as Brad said Q2 delivered $0.51 per share and $6,354,000 in after-tax income to the shareholders. This is 50% earnings per share growth compared to $0.34 per share, the same quarter in 2016 and 28% growth over the $0.40 per share in the March 2017 quarter.
Interest income was up 1,867,000 from first quarter and interest expense was up 561,000 both increases largely due to the Hoxie branches being online for an entire quarter. Loan yield in the second quarter was 5.45% and scrubs for higher-than-expected purchase accounting accretion of about $125,000 was approximately 5.42%. This compares to adjusted Q1 yield on loans of about 5.38%.
Securities yield was 2.57% in the second quarter normalized for $215,000 bond call gain compared to 2.44% in the first quarter. This increasing yield is due primarily from a slowdown in CMBS prepayment speeds resulting in less premium amortization.
Deposit cost increased from 62 basis points to 65 basis points, a modest reflection of overall rate increases. Cost of other borrowings increased 23 basis points to 1.28% as a Federal Home Loan Bank cost increased following the Fed rate hikes. All of this leads to net interest margin of 3.91% and adjusted for the unusual purchase accounting and securities yield lift as mentioned above results a net interest margin of 3.83% compared to about 3.80% for Q1.
Provision for loan losses was 628,000 in the quarter on muted net charge-offs of $108,000 or about three basis points. Our credit quality remains high and our ALLL has grown 18% since the beginning of the year.
Noninterest income was generally in line with expectations. Noninterest expense was higher than expected primarily from growth related expenditures of approximately $136,000 in merger expenses, $100,000 in recruiting, and $50,000 in core deposit intangible amortization greater than forecast, and from higher than budgeted EDP of $115,000 and travel and training of $50,000.
Income taxes were approximately in line with our expectations at about 32.4%. As mentioned earlier, stated earnings per share is $0.51 per share, left in the securities payoff gain and purchase accounting accretion in excess of business plan represent about $0.02 per share and drag from merger expenses represent about $0.01 per share resulting in an adjusted EPS of about $0.50 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, Brad will add some color to loans and deposits.
Brad Elliott
Our loan growth was lower than normal in the second quarter at just over $9 million primarily because we had one large credit payoff. As we did not chase rate and credit structure below our standards in order to retain it. Our team has continued to an outstanding job of sourcing and servicing customers who understand relationship banking and the value it brings to their businesses. I remain pleased with our pipeline for quality credits.
Our community markets are doing well thanks to efforts from all our lenders in those markets and our metro lending team led by Mark Parman in Kansas City and Jeremy Machain in Wichita continued to develop and close fee relationships within our guidelines.

It is also exciting to think about onboarding Mike Bezanson and his team in Tulsa later this year and Mark Detten and his team in Ponca City. They had two new markets with outstanding lenders to the Equity team.
Regarding deposits, our teams did a nice job of cultivating new deposits. One of our highly successful customers invested approximately $25 million in their business in the second quarter utilizing deposits held through first quarter year - first quarter end to do so. Otherwise, our deposits increased by approximately $23 million in the quarter.
Greg Kossover
On the rest of the balance sheet, investment securities balances were relatively flat during the quarter and OREO was up only because of the known nonperforming loan identified premerger and marked appropriately move to OREO as anticipated.
Our ALLL stands at 49 basis points of loans up three basis points quarter-over-quarter and from year end, nearly every special asset metric improved during the quarter. Classified assets to regulatory capital has already declined 4% after the most recent acquisitions to 24%, past due loans declined 26% from 27 basis points to 20 basis points of loans and nonaccrual loans dropped 9% to 1.69% of total loans quarter-over-quarter. These improvements are the result of a lot of hard work from Julie, Scott Smits and their teams.
Federal Home Loan Bank advances end of the quarter at about the same level as March 31. Our asset liability position has not changed measurably quarter-over-quarter and we remain day one liability sensitive and year one asset sensitive.
Capital ratios all remained strong and is worth mentioning that we issued over 3,980,000 common shares in the last three quarters in the two acquisitions and the pipe representing share growth of 49%. This type of share growth is cost efficient, adds float and the dispersion of shares is healthy for our stock and its holders.
Brad Elliott
As I said at the top of the call, we cross several key lines on our core metrics, greater than 1% ROA per quarter and efficiency ratio of less than 60%. We are growing into our efficiencies and we believe our too-pronged approach of growing organically and through mergers gives us an advantage in our markets.
Our credit quality remains high, our margin is healthy, our organic loan and deposit pipelines are active, as is our merger pipeline. Our Board and leadership are more excited than ever for what is possible for our stakeholders.
I would like to thank all of our shareholders for their trust in Equity Bancshares and all its team members. This is an exciting time for everyone and we could not be successful without each of you.
At this time, I'd be happy to entertain questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Liesch from Sandler O’Neill. Your line is open.
Andrew Liesch
Question on the margin and any benefits from the rate hike I think in prior quarters you said it will be about two basis points, was that the case this quarter and then do you think the June hike will be similar benefit in the third quarter?
Brad Elliott
Yes Andrew, I think our margin improved for a couple of reasons the rate hike and then also we had a small lift from the yield on the portfolio brought over from Hoxie but primarily the rate hike and yes we would anticipate a similar reaction in Q3.
Andrew Liesch
And then - I am sorry I missed it, the other line item in noninterest income just curious what drove that increase?
Brad Elliott
Increase in noninterest income is - boy...
Andrew Liesch
Just may be the four quarter in fact the Hoxie, do it couple hundred thousand dollars as well.
Brad Elliott
The impact from Hoxie and Andrew off the top of my head, I don't know what the other component is most of it would be the increase in Hoxie, give me a minute and let me dig into what that is.

Operator
And our next question comes from Michael Perito from KBW. Your line is open.
Michael Perito
Greg, I apologize. I know, I think you probably went through it in the opening remarks, but I got on the call little late. I just want to confirm a couple margin numbers with you. I think last quarter, the loan fees were about 16 basis points, do you have that number for the second quarter?
Greg Kossover
Yes, it’s real similar, loan fees were flat to a little better quarter-over-quarter and are pretty strong so that number has not changed measurably.
Michael Perito
Okay. And then the purchase accounting or accruable impact, I think it was 16 basis points last quarter and once again, I apologize, if you gave it already, but what was it in the second quarter?
Greg Kossover
About the same.
Michael Perito
About the same, okay. And then any comments on kind of where you expect the quarterly expense trajectory to run here? I guess really just - in the next couple of quarters before Patriot and Eastman close.
Greg Kossover
Yes, if you carve out transaction expenses related to those two acquisitions a core run rate is probably between $14,600,000 a quarter $14,800,000 I think is a good run rate and probably closer to $14.8 million.
Michael Perito
Okay. And do you expect the - maybe a question on the balance sheet, do you expect the investment portfolio to kind of I guess - with these two deals coming off at the end of the year and it build a little on the quarter. My guess is because the loan growth - the net loan growth didn't materialize. But how do you - what is your kind of six months outlook through the investment portfolio. Do you think it kind of hangs out in this real north of $600 million range or do you think there's room to move it down as the growth picks up in the back half of the year?
Greg Kossover
I think that probably you’re going to see it relatively flat $600 million is probably a good number for us right now, I don't think it will increase Michael, it may go down a little bit but I don't think it will be higher than what it is today.
Michael Perito
Thank you for that. And then just last one for Brad. Maybe just, do you - and again, I apologize if I missed it. But the, maybe the dollar on the pipeline, how does it compare today versus three months ago or maybe at the beginning of the year? And I guess it sounds like you guys despite things putting on credit expect loan growth to rebound a bit in the next quarters. Is that a fair statement?
Greg Kossover
So we've got a really good pipeline, July is looking like a solid month, August assuming that all the fundings hold in that are scheduled for closing July will be a very large months for us probably double what July would be then we have a kind of normal month in September. So we have a pretty good pipeline for this quarter and we also have a pretty good longer than 60 days pipeline a lot of those fundings we got a good growth number coming from just construction draws that are already on the books.
So, I think our pipeline is holding in there pretty well. I think the number show we’re going to back on plan for this month. So I think we've got a good pipeline and anticipating knock on wood that nothing comes out of the wood work on our paydown or something. I think we've got a pretty good opportunity to continue to grow loans.
Our teams in Wichita, Kansas cities and the guys in Western Kansas are really kicking in and have a lot of really good opportunities that we've approved so.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Terry McAvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.
Nathaniel Tower
Hey guys this is actually Nat standing for Terry. Maybe some commentary on deposit pricing and deposit betas in some of your community markets might be helpful?

Brad Elliott
Repeat that question Terry.
Nathaniel Tower
This is actually Nat, any commentary around how deposit are repricing right now, how betas are looking and then your outlook for that would be helpful?
Brad Elliott
You will take that Greg.
Greg Kossover
One more time
Brad Elliott
He wants know about the deposit - you’re breaking a little bit I think we’ve got it. So the question Nat is how deposits repricing is working and how the betas are working.
Nathaniel Tower
Exactly.
Greg Kossover
Yes, so Nat I think they broke on me - the betas are still very low, deposit repricing is still very small. We still - other than in our public deposit sector which does is influenced more easily by rate increases than the retail base. We really haven't seen significant upward pressure on our rates and therefore our betas are still low. I don’t how long that will last and we were adding some new markets which might have a different characteristic as we go forward.
But so far we’re not seeing a huge spike and the need for rate increases to draw deposits. Public funds because of the nature of their ownership are more sensitive to rate increases and we do carry public funds as a core business for us. And so that would be the exception to that comment.
Nathaniel Tower
And then maybe one more from me. And I'm sorry we keep beating a dead horse here, but credit keeps looking great. Do you guys have any areas that you’re watching out for specifically, any areas of concern or anything that you’re staying away from that?
Brad Elliott
So at this time we don't see a lot of weakness, I mean we are staying away from things that would have a lot of volatility but we aren’t getting a lot of those requests either in the oil and gas business but - direct oil and gas business but at this time outside of, you know that sector we just don't see - we haven't felt or seen a lot of weaknesses in our marketplace.
We’re watching the Ag credits closely and we’re monitoring our borrowers. They actually are having a pretty good year this year especially if they have a balance at all of any cattle they have a lot of rebound in the cattle markets. So that sector is actually doing better than we had anticipated but we've got our eye on multi-family making sure that you know we’re in projects at work and we don't have a lot of concentration in that but we got our eye on that sector it just seems like it's overheated for some reason, but they still seem to be written up and leasing up
Operator
And our next question comes from [Bruce Binisie] from Private Investor. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
You're talking about the efficiency ratio of 59% however when I look at Page 5 it’s 60.7, it was the 59 just second quarter or what the…?
Brad Elliott
59% is just the second quarter.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Brad Elliott
So the 60% is year-to-date and as you can see really with the integration of Prairie merger we’ve got - it's coming down.
Unidentified Analyst
One other question, on Page 12 under the capital ratios, its listing risk-weighted for both Equity Banks here and the bank at 1,685,000,000. They don't have the same amount of assets do they, is there a difference there or what amount are looking at?
Greg Kossover
On the capital ratios roughly the same Bruce.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, okay, all right well that's fine. I was just making sure. Those are my question.
Operator
And at this time I'm showing no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. John Hanley for any closing remarks.
Greg Kossover
Andrew this is Greg again. Since you've asked your question I have done quick scan of our other miscellaneous incomes and a lot of it comes from having the Western Kansas be bigger from the Prairie acquisition and a lot of those accounts are related to customer activity which is always a little more brisk in the second quarter than the first quarter. So I'm not seeing anyone category that's driving that change in other income.

John Hanley
With that said, ladies and gentlemen thank you once again for joining the discussion and presentation of our Equity Bancshares Q2 results. This webcast and archive will be available for one week on-site. Have a great day and a great weekend and thanks again.

Branch footprint will include locations in Ponca City, Newkirk, Tulsa following mergers

WICHITA, Kan., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQBK) ("Equity" or the "Company"), parent company of Equity Bank, announced today it has entered into two definitive merger agreements with Oklahoma-based banks. Equity entered into definitive merger agreements with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. ("Eastman"), the parent of The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk, Oklahoma, and Cache Holdings, Inc. ("Patriot"), the parent company of Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Equity intends to close the mergers simultaneously during the fourth quarter of 2017.








































After the mergers conclude, Equity will have completed 13 successful integrations in its first 15 years, and five mergers since the Company's initial public offering on November 11, 2015. These newest mergers add a fourth state - Oklahoma - to Equity's Midwestern footprint, and each is within close proximity to Equity's corporate office in Wichita. Eastman's headquarters is 55 miles from Wichita, and 10 miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma border. Tulsa is 170 miles from Wichita.
"Each time we partner with a strong, local community bank, we're fortunate to work alongside a group of bankers who match up with our philosophy of strong credit culture, significant community involvement, and commitment to our customers. Eastman and Patriot are no exception. We're pleased to welcome employees and leadership with similar values to ours," said Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity. "We believe these mergers continue our model of adding markets that help build our footprint, like Ponca City and Newkirk, complemented by metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and now Tulsa. We're proud to offer sophisticated, innovative financial products and services coupled with the customization and local decision-making customers expect from a community bank."
Equity reported $2.40 billion in consolidated total assets, net loans of $1.51 billion, and deposits of $1.82 billion as of March 31, 2017. Equity operates 37 Equity Bank branch offices in Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri. After consummation of the transactions, which are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Equity expects to be approximately $3.01 billion in consolidated total assets, including 42 branch offices across the four-state footprint of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The combined institution is expected to have $2.08 billion in loans and $2.29 billion in deposits.
Eastman National Bank and Eastman National Bancshares, Inc.
Eastman principally conducts banking business through four full-service branch locations in Kay County, Oklahoma, including branches in Ponca City, Oklahoma and the original Eastman branch in Newkirk, Oklahoma, which was established in 1893 as The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk.
"We're pleased to announce our next chapter and continued, dedicated service to the Ponca City and Newkirk communities. We're particularly pleased to work with Equity Bank to deliver straightforward financial solutions with the local decision-making that our customers have trusted for more than 100 years," said Mark Detten, President and CEO of Eastman.
"Our customers and communities will benefit from additional products, services and solutions of a strong bank with a regional network committed to Kay County and our community bank customers," added Mr. Detten.
As of March 31, 2017, Eastman had $254.0 million in total assets, $181.5 million in loans and $217.6 million in deposits. Eastman ranks No. 2 in FDIC deposit market share in Kay County, Oklahoma, with share of 24.31% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. Eastman's local leadership will continue to serve Kay County as part of Equity, including Mr. Detten, Senior Vice President Darin Kirchenbauer and Senior Vice President Erin Liberton.

Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Eastman common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Eastman common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 6.1389 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $48.91 in cash.
Based on Equity's closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $46.6 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement.
Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.20 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018, and $0.21 accretive to earnings per share in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $4.6 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 3.2% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all "Well Capitalized" capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments.

Tulsa is the second-largest metropolitan statistical area in Oklahoma, with a diverse economy that includes wholesale and retail trade, professional and business services, government and health services as its largest segments.
"We're pleased to partner with a bank that shares many of our core principles and values, and provides honest, straightforward service to our business clients," said Mike Bezanson, Chairman and CEO of Patriot.

At closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Patriot's parent company will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the approval of Patriot shareholders. Patriot's long-tenured management team of Mr. Bezanson, Jay Morey, and Philip Houchin will continue to serve Equity's Tulsa market.
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Patriot, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Patriot will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $2,288.33 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Patriot common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 53 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $615.12 in cash.

Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity's management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity's financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "forecast," "goal," "target," "would" and "outlook," or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature.  These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity's industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity's control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity's expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in Equity's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity's behalf may issue.
Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

Branch footprint will include locations in Ponca City, Newkirk, Tulsa following mergers

WICHITA, Kan., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQBK) ("Equity" or the "Company"), parent company of Equity Bank, announced today it has entered into two definitive merger agreements with Oklahoma-based banks. Equity entered into definitive merger agreements with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. ("Eastman"), the parent of The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk, Oklahoma, and Cache Holdings, Inc. ("Patriot"), the parent company of Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Equity intends to close the mergers simultaneously during the fourth quarter of 2017.








































After the mergers conclude, Equity will have completed 13 successful integrations in its first 15 years, and five mergers since the Company's initial public offering on November 11, 2015. These newest mergers add a fourth state - Oklahoma - to Equity's Midwestern footprint, and each is within close proximity to Equity's corporate office in Wichita. Eastman's headquarters is 55 miles from Wichita, and 10 miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma border. Tulsa is 170 miles from Wichita.
"Each time we partner with a strong, local community bank, we're fortunate to work alongside a group of bankers who match up with our philosophy of strong credit culture, significant community involvement, and commitment to our customers. Eastman and Patriot are no exception. We're pleased to welcome employees and leadership with similar values to ours," said Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity. "We believe these mergers continue our model of adding markets that help build our footprint, like Ponca City and Newkirk, complemented by metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and now Tulsa. We're proud to offer sophisticated, innovative financial products and services coupled with the customization and local decision-making customers expect from a community bank."
Equity reported $2.40 billion in consolidated total assets, net loans of $1.51 billion, and deposits of $1.82 billion as of March 31, 2017. Equity operates 37 Equity Bank branch offices in Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri. After consummation of the transactions, which are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Equity expects to be approximately $3.01 billion in consolidated total assets, including 42 branch offices across the four-state footprint of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The combined institution is expected to have $2.08 billion in loans and $2.29 billion in deposits.
Eastman National Bank and Eastman National Bancshares, Inc.
Eastman principally conducts banking business through four full-service branch locations in Kay County, Oklahoma, including branches in Ponca City, Oklahoma and the original Eastman branch in Newkirk, Oklahoma, which was established in 1893 as The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk.
"We're pleased to announce our next chapter and continued, dedicated service to the Ponca City and Newkirk communities. We're particularly pleased to work with Equity Bank to deliver straightforward financial solutions with the local decision-making that our customers have trusted for more than 100 years," said Mark Detten, President and CEO of Eastman.
"Our customers and communities will benefit from additional products, services and solutions of a strong bank with a regional network committed to Kay County and our community bank customers," added Mr. Detten.
As of March 31, 2017, Eastman had $254.0 million in total assets, $181.5 million in loans and $217.6 million in deposits. Eastman ranks No. 2 in FDIC deposit market share in Kay County, Oklahoma, with share of 24.31% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. Eastman's local leadership will continue to serve Kay County as part of Equity, including Mr. Detten, Senior Vice President Darin Kirchenbauer and Senior Vice President Erin Liberton.
At closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Eastman will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including Eastman shareholder approval. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Eastman, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Eastman will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $242.72 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Eastman common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Eastman common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 6.1389 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $48.91 in cash.
Based on Equity's closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $46.6 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement.
Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.20 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018, and $0.21 accretive to earnings per share in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $4.6 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 3.2% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all "Well Capitalized" capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments.
Patriot Bank and Cache Holdings, Inc.
Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma was established in 1995 and focused on commercial loans and treasury services to the Tulsa community. Tulsa is the second-largest metropolitan statistical area in Oklahoma, with a diverse economy that includes wholesale and retail trade, professional and business services, government and health services as its largest segments.
"We're pleased to partner with a bank that shares many of our core principles and values, and provides honest, straightforward service to our business clients," said Mike Bezanson, Chairman and CEO of Patriot. "Since founding Patriot Bank, we've worked tirelessly to meet the financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients. We're pleased to add the products, services, and entrepreneurial spirit of a bank that will help our local loan officers and professionals offer quick, local decisions, and is committed to Tulsa."
As of March 31, 2017, Patriot had total assets of $320.0 million, loans of $287.7 million, and $271.6 million in deposits. Patriot ranks No. 20 in FDIC deposit market share out of 291 institutions in the Tulsa metropolitan statistical area, with a market share of 1.01% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial.
At closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Patriot's parent company will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the approval of Patriot shareholders. Patriot's long-tenured management team of Mr. Bezanson, Jay Morey, and Philip Houchin will continue to serve Equity's Tulsa market.
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Patriot, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Patriot will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $2,288.33 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Patriot common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 53 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $615.12 in cash.
Based on Equity's closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $50.5 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement.
Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.15 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018 and $0.16 accretive in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $2.7 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 2.1% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be approximately 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all "Well Capitalized" capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments.

No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirement of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity's management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity's financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "forecast," "goal," "target," "would" and "outlook," or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature.  These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity's industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity's control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity's expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.
For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in Equity's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity's behalf may issue.
Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

Equity Bancshares, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter and Record Year-to-Date 2017 Results
Announcement Comes Days After Two Oklahoma-Based Bank Mergers Announced



















July 20, 2017 16:30 ET

 | Source: Equity Bancshares, Inc.






WICHITA, Kan., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQBK) (“Equity”, “we”, “us”, “our”), the Wichita-based holding company of Equity Bank, reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017, including record net income allocable to common stockholders of $6.4 million and record diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the second quarter. Year-to-date 2017 net income allocable to common stockholders was $11.2 million and $0.91 per diluted share, also both records. Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity, said, “Our operating teams, including new teammates from Arkansas and Western Kansas, worked diligently and tenaciously to successfully integrate our new markets, while continuing to serve customers. Realizing synergies immediately after mergers is important to our earnings success. We are proud of how well our teams execute, as evidenced by our record quarterly and year-to-date earnings.” Mr. Elliott added, “We also continue to position our self for growth opportunities, including our recent announcement of two mergers in Oklahoma. It’s a credit to the innovative collaboration among our Equity employees, and future Oklahoma team members, that we’re able to continue to add strong community banks to our footprint, while refining delivery and developing new solutions for our business and consumer customers.” On July 17, 2017, Equity announced that it entered into definitive merger agreements with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. (“Eastman”) of Newkirk and Ponca City, Oklahoma, parent company of Eastman National Bank, and Cache Holdings, Inc. (“Patriot”), parent company of Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the mergers conclude, which are expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2017, Equity will have completed 13 successful integrations in its first 15 years and five mergers since the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) on November 11, 2015. These newest mergers add a fourth state – Oklahoma – to Equity’s Midwestern footprint, and each is within close proximity to Equity’s corporate office in Wichita. Eastman’s headquarters is 55 miles from Wichita and 10 miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma border. Tulsa is 170 miles from Wichita. Equity completed its merger with Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. (“Prairie”) of Hoxie, Kansas, on Friday, March 10, 2017, and completed its merger with Community First Bancshares, Inc. (“Community”) of Harrison, Arkansas, on November 10, 2016. Results of operations of Prairie are included in Equity’s second-quarter results subsequent to its merger, and results of Equity’s Arkansas locations are fully included in 2017 results. Equity continued to bolster its teams in the second quarter, and on May 22, 2017 announced the promotion of Julie Huber to a new leadership role as Executive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives – directing merger implementation and other strategic plans and opportunities for Equity. Huber served in a variety of leadership roles for Equity Bank since 2003, including management of operations, risk and credit. In addition, the Company added Scott Smits as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Equity Bank to its leadership team. Smits joined Equity after 9 years in executive credit and risk management positions for Standard Bank and Trust Co. in Hickory Hills, Illinois, and has more than 30 years of experience in commercial lending, strategic planning, and risk management functions within the financial industry. Financial Results for Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Net income allocable to common stockholders was $11.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $4.9 million or 78.5%. Financial results reflect the merger of Community, beginning November 11, 2016, and the merger of Prairie beginning March 11, 2017. The merger of Community added five branch locations in northern Arkansas with total assets of $503.7 million and the merger of Prairie added three branch locations in western Kansas with total assets of $153.1 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, there was $136 thousand in merger expenses related to the Community merger and $926 thousand in merger expenses related to the Prairie merger. Diluted earnings per share were $0.91 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.75 for the comparable period of 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares were 12,264,156 and 8,326,615 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The increase in weighted average fully diluted shares reflect the issuance of 2,689,690 shares in connection with the November 2016 merger with Community, 770,000 shares issued on December 20, 2016 in a private placement, and 479,465 shares issued in connection with the March 2017 merger with Prairie. Net interest income was $41.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $25.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a $16.1 million or 64.7% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin was 3.93% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 3.25% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in overall volume and yield on interest-earning assets including an increase in accretion of purchase accounting discounts mainly attributable to loans acquired in the Community and Prairie mergers partially offset by an increase in overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 16 basis points. Also, during the first six months of 2016 we utilized a “leverage” or “spread” opportunity. The spread opportunity involved borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions. Our net interest margin, without the spread opportunity, would have been approximately 3.55% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company suspended the utilization of this strategy effective October 1, 2016; therefore, there was no impact to net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as a result of the spread opportunity. The provision for loan losses was $1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $587 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $731 thousand for the comparable period of 2016. Total non-interest income was $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $5.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Increases in service charges and fees, debit card income, and mortgage banking are principally attributable to the addition of accounts and higher transaction volumes associated with the Community and Prairie acquisitions. Non-interest income includes increase in value of bank owned life insurance of $709 thousand and $497 thousand for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and net gains from securities transactions of $96 thousand and $479 thousand in the same respective time periods. Total non-interest expense was $30.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $19.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. These results primarily reflect the effect of the Community and Prairie mergers and increased data processing costs principally associated with increased debit card volumes. Non-interest expense also includes merger expense primarily related to the Prairie merger. Equity’s effective tax rate for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 was 31.2% as compared to 31.8% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016.  The effective tax rates for each of the comparable periods reflect the levels of tax-exempt interest income, non-taxable life insurance income, non-deductible facilitative merger expenses, and other non-deductible expenses included in income before income taxes as well as federal income tax credits in Equity’s financial results for the respective periods.  The lower effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 is principally attributable to $216 thousand of excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options during the period. In accordance with ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, excess tax benefits generated when the tax-return deductible compensation expense for share-based awards exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes are recorded as an income tax benefit in the income statement in the period in which they occur. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, in the first quarter of 2017, excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options were recognized as additional paid-in capital. Financial Results for Quarter Ended June 30, 2017 Net income allocable to common stockholders was $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $3.5 million or 123.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.34 for the comparable period of 2016. Weighted average fully diluted shares were 12,444,859 and 8,329,299 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The increase in weighted average fully diluted shares reflect the issuance of 2,689,690 shares in connection with the November 2016 merger with Community, 770,000 shares issued on December 20, 2016, in a private placement, and 479,465 shares issued in connection with the March 2017 merger with Prairie. Net interest income was $21.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a $9.0 million or 73.8% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as we funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin was 3.91% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to 3.18% for the same time period in 2016. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an overall increase in volume and yield of interest-earning assets including an increase in accretion of purchase accounting discounts related to the Community and Prairie mergers, partially offset by an overall increase in volumes and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company utilized a “leverage” or “spread” opportunity. The spread opportunity involved borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions. Our net interest margin, without the spread opportunity, would have been approximately 3.48% for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company suspended the utilization of this strategy effective October 1, 2016; therefore, there was no impact to net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The provision for loan losses was $628 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $532 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2017, were $108 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $482 thousand for the comparable period of 2016. Total non-interest income was $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Increases in service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking are principally attributable to the addition of accounts and higher transaction volumes associated with the Community merger and to a lesser extent, the March 2017 Prairie merger. Non-interest income includes increase in value of bank owned life insurance of $354 thousand and $246 thousand for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and net gains from securities transactions of $83 thousand and $59 thousand for the same respective time periods. Total non-interest expense was $15.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $9.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. These results primarily reflect the effect of the November 2016 Community merger, which added five locations in Arkansas, the March 2017 Prairie merger, which added three additional Kansas locations, and increased data processing costs principally associated with increased debit card volumes. Equity’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017, was 32.4% as compared to 31.8% for the comparable period ended June 30, 2016. The effective tax rates for each of the comparable periods reflect the levels of tax-exempt interest income, non-taxable life insurance income, non-deductible facilitative merger expenses, and other non-deductible expenses included in income before income taxes as well as federal income tax credits in Equity’s financial results for the respective periods. Loans, Deposits, and Total Assets Loans held for investment were $1.53 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $145.8 million.  The increase in loans held for investment includes $130.1 million of net loans acquired in the Prairie merger in March of 2017 and $15.7 million of other loan growth. As of June 30, 2017, Equity’s allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.49%, compared to 0.46% at December 31, 2016. Net loans of $1.52 billion at June 30, 2017, includes $7.6 million of allowance for loan losses and $11.3 million of acquisition related discounts. Nonperforming assets of $37.6 million as of June 30, 2017, were 1.56% to total assets, and included $8.2 million of nonperforming assets acquired in the Prairie merger. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2016, were $31.3 million or 1.43% of total assets.

Total deposits increased $189.2 million between December 31, 2016, and June 30, 2017, including $125.4 million of deposits assumed in the Prairie merger and $63.9 million, or 3.9%, of non-acquisition related deposit growth, primarily due to our ongoing business development efforts.

These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, Form S-3 or Form S-4. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity’s behalf may issue.

Equity Bancshares, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017; Provides Net Charge-Offs for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 20 17
Equity Bancshares, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $3.5 million or 123.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.51 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.34 for the comparable period of 2016. Net interest income was $21.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a $9.0 million or 73.8% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings. Income before income taxes was $9.402 million against $4.173 million a year ago.

Net income allocable to common stockholders was $11.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $4.9 million or 78.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.91 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.75 for the comparable period of 2016. Net interest income was $41.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $25.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a $16.1 million or 64.7% increase. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as funded the increase in earning assets with increased deposits and borrowings.

Equity Bancshares, Inc. Expands Into Oklahoma, Announces Two Merger Agreements  With Eastman National Bank and Patriot Bank
Branch footprint will include locations in Ponca City, Newkirk, Tulsa following mergers

 | Source: Equity Bancshares, Inc.






WICHITA, Kan., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQBK) (“Equity” or the “Company”), parent company of Equity Bank, announced today it has entered into two definitive merger agreements with Oklahoma-based banks. Equity entered into definitive merger agreements with Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. (“Eastman”), the parent of The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk, Oklahoma, and Cache Holdings, Inc. (“Patriot”), the parent company of Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Equity intends to close the mergers simultaneously during the fourth quarter of 2017. After the mergers conclude, Equity will have completed 13 successful integrations in its first 15 years, and five mergers since the Company’s initial public offering on November 11, 2015. These newest mergers add a fourth state – Oklahoma – to Equity’s Midwestern footprint, and each is within close proximity to Equity’s corporate office in Wichita. Eastman’s headquarters is 55 miles from Wichita, and 10 miles from the Kansas and Oklahoma border. Tulsa is 170 miles from Wichita. “Each time we partner with a strong, local community bank, we’re fortunate to work alongside a group of bankers who match up with our philosophy of strong credit culture, significant community involvement, and commitment to our customers. Eastman and Patriot are no exception. We’re pleased to welcome employees and leadership with similar values to ours,” said Brad Elliott, Chairman and CEO of Equity. “We believe these mergers continue our model of adding markets that help build our footprint, like Ponca City and Newkirk, complemented by metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and now Tulsa. We’re proud to offer sophisticated, innovative financial products and services coupled with the customization and local decision-making customers expect from a community bank.” Equity reported $2.40 billion in consolidated total assets, net loans of $1.51 billion, and deposits of $1.82 billion as of March 31, 2017. Equity operates 37 Equity Bank branch offices in Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri. After consummation of the transactions, which are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Equity expects to be approximately $3.01 billion in consolidated total assets, including 42 branch offices across the four-state footprint of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The combined institution is expected to have $2.08 billion in loans and $2.29 billion in deposits. Eastman National Bank and Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. Eastman principally conducts banking business through four full-service branch locations in Kay County, Oklahoma, including branches in Ponca City, Oklahoma and the original Eastman branch in Newkirk, Oklahoma, which was established in 1893 as The Eastman National Bank of Newkirk. “We’re pleased to announce our next chapter and continued, dedicated service to the Ponca City and Newkirk communities. We’re particularly pleased to work with Equity Bank to deliver straightforward financial solutions with the local decision-making that our customers have trusted for more than 100 years,” said Mark Detten, President and CEO of Eastman. “Our customers and communities will benefit from additional products, services and solutions of a strong bank with a regional network committed to Kay County and our community bank customers,” added Mr. Detten. As of March 31, 2017, Eastman had $254.0 million in total assets, $181.5 million in loans and $217.6 million in deposits. Eastman ranks No. 2 in FDIC deposit market share in Kay County, Oklahoma, with share of 24.31% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. Eastman’s local leadership will continue to serve Kay County as part of Equity, including Mr. Detten, Senior Vice President Darin Kirchenbauer and Senior Vice President Erin Liberton. At closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Eastman will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including Eastman shareholder approval. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Eastman, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Eastman will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $242.72 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Eastman common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Eastman common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 6.1389 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $48.91 in cash. Based on Equity’s closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $46.6 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.20 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018, and $0.21 accretive to earnings per share in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $4.6 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 3.2% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all “Well Capitalized” capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments. Patriot Bank and Cache Holdings, Inc. Patriot Bank of Tulsa, Oklahoma was established in 1995 and focused on commercial loans and treasury services to the Tulsa community. Tulsa is the second-largest metropolitan statistical area in Oklahoma, with a diverse economy that includes wholesale and retail trade, professional and business services, government and health services as its largest segments. “We’re pleased to partner with a bank that shares many of our core principles and values, and provides honest, straightforward service to our business clients,” said Mike Bezanson, Chairman and CEO of Patriot. “Since founding Patriot Bank, we’ve worked tirelessly to meet the financial needs of our commercial and consumer clients. We’re pleased to add the products, services, and entrepreneurial spirit of a bank that will help our local loan officers and professionals offer quick, local decisions, and is committed to Tulsa.” As of March 31, 2017, Patriot had total assets of $320.0 million, loans of $287.7 million, and $271.6 million in deposits. Patriot ranks No. 20 in FDIC deposit market share out of 291 institutions in the Tulsa metropolitan statistical area, with a market share of 1.01% as of June 30, 2016, according to FDIC data published by SNL Financial. At closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, Patriot’s parent company will merge with and into Equity, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the approval of Patriot shareholders. Patriot’s long-tenured management team of Mr. Bezanson, Jay Morey, and Philip Houchin will continue to serve Equity’s Tulsa market. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, approved by the boards of directors of Equity and Patriot, at the effective time of the merger the shareholders of Patriot will have the right to receive an aggregate consideration of approximately $2,288.33 per share. Equity will acquire all outstanding shares of Patriot common stock. The definitive agreement provides that each outstanding share of Patriot common stock will represent the right to receive a fixed exchange ratio of 53 shares of Equity Class A common stock and $615.12 in cash. Based on Equity’s closing stock price on July 14, 2017 of $31.57 per share, the aggregate transaction value is approximately $50.5 million. The actual aggregate transaction value may be subject to equity adjustments prior to closing, as further set forth in the definitive merger agreement. Equity expects the merger to be approximately $0.15 accretive to diluted earnings per share in 2018 and $0.16 accretive in 2019, with transaction-related and one-time costs of approximately $2.7 million. Equity expects the merger to be approximately 2.1% dilutive to tangible book value per share at closing, inclusive of the estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and expects the tangible book value earnback to be approximately 2.8 years. Finally, Equity expects to remain above all “Well Capitalized” capital ratios as defined by regulatory guidelines, inclusive of the impact of all estimated purchase accounting adjustments.

In connection with the proposed merger of Equity and each of Eastman and Patriot, Equity will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) with respect to the proposed merger. Each registration statement will include a proxy statement of Eastman, and a proxy statement of Patriot, respectively, and will constitute a prospectus of Equity, which Patriot and Eastman will send to their respective shareholders. Investors and shareholders are advised to read the proxy statement/prospectus when it becomes available because it will contain important information about Equity, Patriot and Eastman and the proposed transactions. These documents will contain important information relating to the proposed transactions. When filed, this document and other documents relating to the merger filed by Equity can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. These documents also can be obtained free of charge by accessing Equity's website at www.equitybank.com under the tab “Investor Relations” and then under “Financials.” Alternatively, these documents, when available, can be obtained free of charge from Equity by directing a request to Equity Bancshares, Inc., 7701 East Kellogg, Wichita, Kansas 67207, Attention: John J. Hanley, SVP and Director of Investor Relations, Telephone: (316) 612-6000; or to Eastman National Bancshares, Inc., Attention: Mark T.

Participants in the Transactions Eastman, Patriot, and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed under the rules of the SEC to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the respective shareholders of Eastman or Patriot in connection with the proposed transaction. Certain information regarding the interests of these participants and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be included in the proxy statement/prospectus regarding each of the proposed transactions when it becomes available. Additional information about Equity and its directors and officers may be found in the definitive proxy statement of Equity relating to its 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed with the SEC on March 22, 2017 and Equity's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017. The definitive proxy statement and annual report can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. No Offer or Solicitation  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to sell, or the solicitation or an offer to buy any securities. There will be no sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirement of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature.  These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2017 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity’s behalf may issue. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. Important Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully review and consider Equity’s public filings with the SEC, including but not limited to its Annual Report on Form 10-K, its proxy statement, its Current Reports on Form 8-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The documents filed by Equity with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at Equity’s investor relations website at investor.equitybank.com or at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, these documents, when available, can be obtained free of charge from Equity upon written request to Equity Bancshares, Inc., Attn: Investor Relations, 7701 East Kellogg Drive, Suite 300, Wichita, Kansas 67207 or by calling (316) 612-6000.

The family that works together, stays together.An artist is creative, and especially tries to think outside the box. We're small enough to be in each of our stores every day. And we're also large enough to stay on top of the main trends inside the industry.John Rowe - "The Artist"Speedy's Convenience




The business of problem solving. Our ability to help our customers with product development and marketing strategy, logistics, warehousing, trucking. All these things are problems for our customers that we solve on a daily basis. As long as the company's growing, we can continue. Fred Schneider - "The Visionary"RitePack




A bank who can rally behind its companies. Banking is still all about relationships. That's why we choose to bank local ... with a bank who can rally behind us. We've found that in Equity Bank. Casey Lund - "The Healer" Warrensburg Collision




Bank with the best. Equity Bank has been, frankly, the best bank I’ve ever worked with. They’ve been so willing, early on, to grow with us, listen to us and provide us with amazing advice and banking that has been pivotal to our growth. We’ve gone from non-existent, to the second largest firm in our market and a top ten firm in our state.  Bruce Rowley - "The Fireball" RSM Marketing




Focus on what's important. It’s important to us to have a good banker and to pretty much be worry free, because if you’re worry free you can spend your time figuring out what the next #1 glove is going to be.  Stephen Franke - "The Improver" Midwest Quality Gloves




Why pick Equity Bank? Equity Bank has been a fantastic bank and partner to work with in representing our clients needs, as well as supporting our needs and what we do for the client.  Michelle Becker - "The Analyst" Profit Builders, Inc.
