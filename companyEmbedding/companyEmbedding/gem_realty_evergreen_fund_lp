CHICAGO and SIGNAL HILL, Calif., Jan. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sterling Partners, a leading growth-oriented private equity firm with approximately $5 billion of assets under management, announced today the sale of its portfolio company GEM Mobile Treatment Services (GEM), a leading provider of engineered environmental remediation solutions for vapor control and wastewater treatment needs in the petroleum, petrochemical, environmental and energy industries, to Evergreen Industrial Services (Evergreen). Evergreen provides a comprehensive range of industrial cleaning services for oil refineries, petrochemical plants, power generation plants, manufacturing sites and mills. Financial details surrounding the transaction were not disclosed.
"Since partnering with Sterling to scale our business, we've built GEM to be a market leader that provides critical engineered solutions to our customers," said GEM founder and COO Paul Anderson. "We're excited to continue serving our customers in partnership with Evergreen." 
Anderson will assume leadership of GEM from Steve Ragiel, who has served as CEO since 2012. "Sterling's capital investment, understanding of this niche market and experience working with founder-led businesses has enabled GEM's management team to broaden the Company's service offerings and expand into new markets," Ragiel said. "Due to the unique solutions we offer and the strategic plan we've developed, GEM is positioned to keep growing under Paul's leadership as it enters this next phase."  
Founded in 1994, GEM provides innovative vapor and water processing and treatment technologies on either a mobile or fixed basis to solve routine or complex treatment projects that allow customers to meet or exceed environmental, regulatory and safety standards. 
"Sterling's investment in GEM was consistent with our strategy of partnering with founders and backing innovative companies that provide high-quality services in growing industries," said Mike Drai, Principal at Sterling Partners.
Sterling formed its partnership with GEM in 2010, and worked closely with GEM's founder and management team to develop a focused organic growth strategy, implement operational best practices and create systems and procedures to scale services throughout North America from six strategic locations within the United States. 
With this sale, Sterling has successfully exited four companies within its active industrial, commercial and energy services portfolio. Sterling focuses on partnering with business services companies in the logistics, financial services, and industrial, commercial and energy sectors that consistently increase efficiency, improve quality and mitigate risk.
