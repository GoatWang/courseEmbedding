               Company: Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates
Job Details
               Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates creates architecture that is implicitly sustainable in its capacity to endure. By designing projects of the utmost quality, contextual sensitivity, flexibility, and performance, we produce work that not only succeeds in the near term but also builds value over time. As our practice has grown, we have reinforced this strategy by incorporating the latest methods and technologies to maximize occupant comfort while lowering long-term operating and maintenance costs, reducing consumption of non-renewable resources, and minimizing waste and negative environmental impacts during the construction process. Applying our global experience at a local scale, we develop holistic solutions that are unique to place, climate, and program and are evaluated through regional environmental performance standards such as LEED, BREEAM, Three Star, and Estidama, among others. We extend this approach beyond the individual building to the realm of urban design with the core belief that density, as opposed to sprawl, is the best way to address the world's most pressing issue: rapid population growth and consequent migration into cities. The tall tower is a key part of this sustainable paradigm in which individual buildings form part of a larger system of vertical centers linked by horizontal networks of public transportation. Rather than objects in isolation, these transit-integrated, mixed-use "vertical cities" represent a sustainable model for future development whereby public transport is encouraged, land is conserved, and energy and water uses are reduced. We apply this philosophy not only to our work, but also to the way we run our business. Developing design and operations targets, monitoring changes, reviewing strategies, and reporting progress publicly, we strive to continually improve the firm and increase our positive contribution to the environment through business and design practices that are consistent with our broader social and environmental values. The LEED Gold certification of our headquarters in New York City is one of many examples of how we fulfill this long-standing commitment. We are also active members of the United Nations Environment Programme Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative (UNEP-SBCI), the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and the U.K. Green Building Council (UKGBC). We recently established a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) partnership with a local farm, reducing transportation-related pollution and providing members with direct access to fresh produce. Through these and other associations and initiatives, we work with our peers to promote an industry-wide commitment to economic, social, and ecological sustainability.

						Welcome					
 





Welcome to the 
All Natural Country Store
 Proud Distributor of J.R. Watkins Naturals

All of us remember fondly certain products that our moms kept their kitchens, baths and medicine chests that made our childhoods special. That’s why when we first considered a home-based business to help ends meet, Alan remembered Watkins. His folks were always watching the family budget, carefully shopping for the best bargain on necessities. Imagine his surprise when he requested further information about starting a home-based Watkins business in February of 2009 and received a company catalog. In flipping through the pages, he recognized a number of items – in the same packaging – that lined the shelves of his boyhood home.  But more importantly, the prices seemed quite reasonable in comparison with some of the big-name brands that line the shelves of our big supermarket and drug store chains.
The Man Behind Watkins
J. R. Watkins was a wise man. Not only did he create a company that has been around since 1868, he realized that people will most likely buy a product if they hear about it from a friend, or tasted it in their friend’s home. He also realized that rather than pay for expensive advertising and marketing, or pay a store owner a commission to sell his products, friends could tell their friends about Watkins and earn that commission themselves. America’s first direct-sales company was on its way.
Watkins also stood behind his products, and offered the country’s first money-back guarantee. Today, you will see a line on bottles and jars that indicate customers should use the product until the contents reach that level. If the customer is not satisfied for any reason, they will be refunded their full purchase price. Just imagine how easy it is to sell products with that kind of guarantee behind them!
A Commitment to Quality
As Watkins matured as a company, it grew because of its commitment to quality, as well as its goal to create additional products that help sustain the planet for future generations.  We suppose you could say that Watkins was this country’s first Green Company long before the term was ever used!  No wonder the company has experienced such a long, successful history.
Of course, it is nearly impossible for Watkins to be sold door-to-door as it was for many years. Today, with the growing popularity of online shopping, it has become even easier for individuals to launch a Watkins home-based business. The support you receive from individuals who have successfully been doing this for many years is amazing!
It is with this kind of support that our All Natural Country Store has become a thriving home-based business. We invite you to explore this site, review this month’s specials and check out the full Watkins catalog.
We Can Get It For You Wholesale
If you find a number of items that you must try right away, we invite you to become an All Natural Country Store Consultant! In so doing, you will receive a discount on everything you order.  There is a $39.95 fee to join, currently marked down to $19.95.  To sign up now go to www.jrwatkins.com/consultant/GoNatural , click on “Sign In/Create Account” and then click on “Join Us as a Consultant.”  Then start saving on dozens of products you use every day.
