Online lender Prospa raises $20 million from Silicon Valley’s Partners for Growth

Prospa, the startup behind an online lending platform targeting small businesses, has announced that it has raised a $20 million debt facility from Silicon Valley based VC firm Partners For Growth (PFG).
The announcement comes only a few months after the startup closed a $25 million funding round led by AirTree Ventures in February, which contributed to helping the business grow its technology and team.
Bringing the startup’s total raise to date to approximately $118 million, the new funding will be used to help accelerate the company’s “general corporate purposes” forward, according to the company’s CFO, Ed Bigazzi.
“The PFG funding will be used for general corporate purposes including investing further in product, design and technology, and building scalability in our credit decision engine to enable us to handle increasing demand more efficiently. A stable balance sheet will also enable us to look at any investment opportunities that might present themselves over time,” said Bigazzi.
Prospa named Bigazzi as an integral part in forming the startup’s fundraising strategy, which helped form the deal with PFG.
Bigazzi added that PFG’s ‘alternative’ funding strategy, in which the firm solely focuses on fast-growing tech companies, made them an ideal partner to looks towards.
“Like our small business customers, Prospa requires funding to grow. PFG plays an important role in the market by filling the gap left by the traditional banking industry,” he said.
“Like us, they take a partnership approach and really took the time to understand our business. They share many of our philosophies about how to build long-term competitive advantages and long-term stakeholder value.”
Launched in 2011, Prospa’s online platform allows small businesses to quickly access unsecured loans of up to $250,000, as the business aims to approve loans and provide funds within 24 hours.
The funding round marks one of the largest fintech VC investments into an Australian business, which is not a new title for Prospa – the startup’s $60 million Series B round, raised in 2015, holds the record for one of the largest investments in a local fintech to date.
Meanwhile, the $25 million Series C round from February marks the biggest investment in an Australian fintech made during the Q2 2016 to Q2 period, according to the recent Global Fintech Trends report from CB Insights.
The Series C round also came in second place for the highest investment in a fintech company outside of core markets such as the US, Europe and Asia.
Ahead of the funding news, Prospa also announced that it had named ‘Best Employer’ in the AON Hewitt Best Employers Program for 2017.
Speaking about the announcement, Prospa’s Joint CEO, Beau Bertoli, said much of the company’s success came down to its employees.
“People are, without a doubt, our number one priority and have been since we began five years ago. Our success is a clear demonstration of what can be achieved when your workforce is happy and engage,” said Bertoli.

About Us









SVASE
The Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs (a.k.a. SVASE) is the largest and fastest growing nonprofit association in Northern California dedicated exclusively to helping startup entrepreneurs across all technology sectors build robust business plans, and find Venture Capital investors to fund their growing startups.
Founded by a group of software engineers in 1995 and growing steadily ever since, SVASE hosts 10-12 events each month, attended by 400-600 entrepreneurs, technology executives and press.  Our weekly newsletters reaches over 10,000 entrepreneurs and executives, making ours one of the largest opt-in lists in the Valley.  And with our web based services, including “24 Hour Networking,” the online “SVASE Yellow Pages,” the unique, searchable  “Startup Reference Guide,”  and “VC Database”, SVASE is able to help entrepreneurs build their business solutions in Silicon Valley, and around the world.
SVASE focuses on assisting technology and life science entrepreneurs through the following stages of startup growth:
Concept Phase
Attend StartUp-U and Main Events to gain insights into key startup issues, evaluate market opportunities and explore the investment potential for your concept.
Business Planning
Having assembled your startup team and launched you company, attend CXO Leadership Forum lunches and Learn from a Legend dinners to gain insights into operational accelerators and pitfalls, flesh out your go-to-market strategy, and validate your value proposition.
Investors and Funding
Understand what investors looks for in a startup, and hone your elevator pitch and business proposition by attending our weekly VC Breakfast Club events.  Understand the Funding Flow and develop your Investor presentation by participating in a Pitch Preparation Workshop, before delivering your funding pitch and receiving quality formal feedback on your business plan from Venture Capital investors and successful entrepreneurs at First Impressions pitch feedback events.
Product Launch
Launch: Silicon Valley provides the platform for introducing your new product to people that can make a difference. Attendees include Venture Capital investors and corporate execs, plus business and technology press and bloggers.  It’s a unique opportunity to do real business and create real buzz in Silicon Valley.  For further information go to www.launchsiliconvalley.org
Moving great ideas into business success stories is what we facilitate at the Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs.  We empower entrepreneurs to be the best they can be, by exposing them to current best practices, providing the means to meet great people who can help them get where they want to go, and by providing opportunities to grow.  As a result, SVASE members attracted over $76MM in Venture Capital in 2008.  Join SVASE today and let our magic work for you  too.

The heart of the tech industry, Silicon Valley is home to many of the world’s largest technology corporations as well as countless startups.

				US-Russia Technology Symposium			

The founders of Silicon Valley Innovation Center co-founded US-Russia Technology Symposium which linked investors, entrepreneurs and motivational leaders in an intense program of inspirational speeches, breakout sessions, networking events and interactive panel discussions focused on creating change, new deals and global partnerships. It explored ways to find niche markets harboring the next big ideas by bringing together business and policy leaders with up-and-coming startups in the real world. It served not only as a platform for unveiling the latest market intelligence, but also as a partnership-building process that allowed companies to transform their vision into reality through strategic alliances.
