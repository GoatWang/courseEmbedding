How it works

The fund aims to invest approximately 40% of its net assets in shares (either directly or through investment in other investment funds) and 60% of its net assets in debt. The fund invests in high quality debt, such as bonds, money market instruments and commercial paper and certificates of deposits issued by governments, other public bodies and companies in developed countries. 
The fund invests to gain exposure to developed and emerging markets using a core strategy meaning that the fund has a general exposure to the stock-market with a greater allocation towards shares of smaller sized companies and value companies. Value companies are those where, at the time of purchase, the fund manager thinks the price is low compared to the accounting value of the company. The fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in emerging markets countries. The fund may use financial derivative instruments for the purposes of hedging and efficient portfolio management. As this fund invests some of its assets outside the eurozone, a currency risk arises for a euro investor.
 
Important Notes 
- Annual management charges (AMC) apply. The fund performance shown in the factsheet and on this website is before the full AMC is applied on your policy.
- In addition to Zurich Life’s normal AMC, this fund is subject to an additional management charge of 0.30% p.a.
- This fund is a ‘two stage switch’ fund, further details of which are available in your policy document or from Zurich Life.

The investment objective of the World Allocation 60/40 ("Fund") is to achieve long-term total return. The fund is managed on a discretionary basis and is a "fund of funds" which means that it mainly invests in other investment funds, but may also invest directly in shares and debt. A fuller statement of the investment policy is available in the prospectus and KIIDs.Risks include loss of principal and fluctuating value. Small cap securities are subject to greater volatility than those in other asset categories. Value investing is subject to risk which may cause underperformance compared to other equity investment strategies. Investing outside the country you live may involve special risks such as currency fluctuation and political instability. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Fixed income securities are subject to loss of principal during periods of rising yields and may be subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, liquidity and other factors. For more detail about the risks related to an investment in the Fund, please see the corresponding KIID and prospectus and in particular "Special Considerations and Risk Factors".This is a sub-fund of Dimensional Funds plc.

Risk statistics

Alpha?Alpha is a measure of a fund's over- or under-performance by comparison to its benchmark. If the Alpha is 5, the fund has outperformed its benchmark by 5%; so the greater the Alpha, the greater the outperformance.6.28 
Beta?Beta estimates a fund's volatility by comparison to that of its benchmark. A fund with a beta close to 1 means that the fund will move generally in line with the benchmark. Higher than 1 and the fund is more volatile than the benchmark and vice versa.0.86 
Sharpe?This commonly-used measure calculates the level of return over and above the return of a notional risk-free investment, such as cash. The difference in returns is then divided by the fund's volatility. The resulting ratio is an indication of the amount of excess return generated per unit of risk.1 
Volatility?Volatility (or standard deviation), when applied to an investment fund, expresses its risk. It shows how widely a range of returns varied from the fund's average return over a particular period. For example, if a fund had an average return of 5%, and its volatility was 15, this would mean that the range of its returns over the period had swung between +20% and -10%.6.02 
Tracking error?This measures the standard deviation of a fund's excess returns over the returns of an index or benchmark portfolio. As such, it can be an indication of 'riskiness' in the manager's investment style. A Tracking Error below 2 suggests a passive approach. At 3 and above the the manager will be deploying a more active investment style.3.83 
Information ratio?This is a useful risk-adjusted measure of actively managed fund performance. It is calculated by deducting the returns of the fund's benchmark from the fund's overall returns, then dividing the result by its tracking error. The higher the Information Ratio the better. It is generally considered that a figure of 0.5 reflects a good performance, 0.75 very good, and 1.00 outstanding.1.48 
R-Squared?An indication of how closely correlated a fund is to an index or a benchmark. Values for R-Squared range between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no correlation at all and 1 showing a perfect match. Values upwards of 0.7 suggest that the fund's behaviour is increasingly linked to its benchmark.0.61
