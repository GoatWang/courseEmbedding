PROSOCO - Wikipedia





















 






PROSOCO

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

PROSOCO, founded in 1937, is a national manufacturer of construction products for cleaning, protecting and maintaining concrete; making building envelopes air- and water-tight; cleaning and restoring masonry buildings. PROSOCO's production and warehouse facility, and corporate headquarters are located in Lawrence, Kansas; construction on that building started in 1998.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1937 as the Process Solvent Company, PROSOCO was originally a Kansas City-based producer of specialty cleaners and engine treatments for the automotive and railroad industries. Largely due to the unprecedented growth of the construction industry in the 1950's the Process Solvent Company turned its full attention to the construction and building maintenance products. In 1967, the Process Solvent Company filed to trademark "PSC", which provided a shorter way to reference the company.[2]
Through the years, PROSOCO has been involved with a number of high profile projects including the United States Capitol Building.[3] The project consisted of removing 150 years of old peeling paint, dirt and grime of the capitol’s west façade. PROSOCO also completed restoration work at The Pentagon after the September, 11 attacks.[4] In 1997 a PROSOCO, Inc. proprietary cleaner (a mixture of glycolic, hydrofluoric, orthophosphoric, and citric acids with a nonionic surfactant) was used in a conservation intervention of The Smithsonian Institution.[5] In 2013, PROSOCO's phthalate-free products were used on the nationally recognized Bullitt Center.[6] PROSOCO's fluid applied air barrier system was awarded Building Green's top-10 products for 2015.
As of 2005[update] the CEO is David Boyer.[citation needed]
Brands[edit]

R-Guard - Air and water barrier system designed to prevent the leakage of air, water & energy through the building envelope.
Sure Klean - A suite of products consisting of masonry sealers, cleaners and restoration treatments for buildings.
Consolideck - A flooring system consisting of concrete densifiers, dyes and cleaners.

AIR TIGHT = ENERGY EFFICIENT


R-Guard air barrier systems stop air leakage through wall structures, rough openings, sheathing seams, and material transitions making your building air tight. And an air tight building is an energy efficient building. That’s why buildings that meet the world’s toughest energy efficiency requirements use R-Guard. The Bullitt Center, considered the world’s greenest commercial building, selected R-Guard for its air and water barrier system.






PROTECT THE ROUGH OPENING


For energy efficient & waterproof buildings, an air barrier's expansion and contraction capability is key. All the different materials in your RO expand and contract at diferent rates. R-Guard’s STP products contain 98% solids to expand and contract with all those materials and keep air and water from getting in to your building.






APPLY RAIN OR SHINE


R-Guard’s STP (Silyl-Terminated-Polymer) products can be applied to damp substrates and rained on immediately. Not all “polyether” products can do this. It takes rain out of the construction schedule.

BEST IN CLASS CHEMICALS


We stake our reputation on making products that are the best in the industry because we know you stake your reputation on your floors. That is why we engineered Consolideck lithium silicate densifiers to have a lower viscosity, and contain more highly reactive silicates than conventional sodium or potassium silicate hardeners. It is why we were the first to introduce maintenance cleaners specificallydesigned for polished concrete floors. It is why our prep cleaners, dyes, and protective treatments are unmatched in the industry. We don’t make products that are 'just good enough' because we know that your clients don't demand floors that are 'just good enough.'






THE CHEMICAL EXPERTS


Our knowledge of concrete chemicals runs deep. We’ve been making treatments for concrete for over 60 years. We were pioneers in bringing lithium silicate densifier technology to polished concrete flooring and we’ve been pushing the industry forward ever since. Our full staff of chemists are constantly improving existing Consolideck formulations and coming up with brand new solutions to the problems you face on the floor.






IN THE TRENCHES WITH YOU


Consolideck technical field reps are located across the country to make sure your job is successful. Whether it is training your crew, attending pre-job meetings, or helping on a problem job, PROSOCO field support is there when you need them.

Sure Klean Weather Seal by PROSOCO    



































                Sure Klean Weather Seal
            

                protect your investment
            



                        Durable and beautiful though it is, over time simple rainwater can visibly decay and stain unprotected concrete, brick and stone. Sure Klean® Weather Seal penetrating water repellents provide an invisible, breathable shield against the water-related enemies of masonry.

INDUSTRY LEADERS


PROSOCO pioneered the first siloxane water repellent in the 1980’s. We’ve been pushing the industry forward with innovative technology for penetrating protective treatments ever since. Our full staff of chemists is constantly working to make products that protect your masonry buildings while keeping up with ever changing chemical regulations.






IN THE TRENCHES WITH YOU


PROSOCO technical field reps are located across the country to make sure your job is successful. They can be for on-site to apply a test panel, identify a stain, help out on a problem job, or train your crew. Their job is to be there when you need them.






STOP WATER DAMAGE


Rainwater soaks into masonry. It dissolves natural salts that recrystallize when the surface dries. The salts build up in the masonry pores from repeated wet/dry cycles. In cold weather, water freezes and expands inside the masonry pores. At first, the cracks and fractures from wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles are microscopic. They don’t stay that way.
