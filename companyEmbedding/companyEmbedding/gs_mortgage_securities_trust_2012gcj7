On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2012 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among the Purchaser, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (in such capacity, the “Master Servicer”), Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as special servicer (the “Special Servicer”), Situs Holdings, LLC, as operating advisor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (in such capacity, the “Certificate Administrator”), and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), pursuant to which the Purchaser will transfer the Mortgage Loans (as defined herein) to a trust fund and certificates representing ownership interests in the Mortgage Loans will be issued by the trust fund (the “Trust Fund”).  In exchange for the Mortgage Loans, the Trust Fund will issue to or at the direction of the Depositor certificates to be known as GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ7, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2012-GCJ7 (collectively, the “Certificates”).  For purposes of this Agreement, “Mortgage Loans” refers to the mortgage loans listed on Exhibit A and “Mortgaged Properties” refers to the properties securing such Mortgage Loans.  In the case of each REMIC Declaration executed on March 29, 2012, the term “Mortgage Loan” includes the related “regular interest” and “residual interest”.
 
The Purchaser and the Seller wish to prescribe the manner of sale of the Mortgage Loans from the Seller to the Purchaser and in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1     Sale and Conveyance of Mortgages; Possession of Mortgage File.  The Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and convey to the Purchaser, without recourse (except as otherwise specifically set forth herein), subject to the rights of the holders of interests in a Companion Loan, all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans identified on Exhibit A to this Agreement (the “Mortgage Loan Schedule”) including all interest and principal received on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any event, excluding payments of principal and interest first due on the Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-Off Date). Upon the sale of the Mortgage Loans, the ownership of each related Note, the Seller’s interest in the related Mortgage represented by the Note and the other contents of the related Mortgage File (all subject to the rights of the holders of interests in a Companion Loan) will be vested in the Purchaser and immediately thereafter the Trustee, and the ownership of records and documents with respect to each Mortgage Loan prepared by or which come into the possession of the Seller shall (subject to the rights of the holders of interests in a Companion Loan) immediately vest in the Purchaser and immediately thereafter the Trustee.  The Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the “Public Certificates”) to the underwriters (the “Underwriters”) specified in the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2012 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), between the Purchaser and the Underwriters, and the Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the “Private Certificates”) to the initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers” and, collectively with the Underwriters, the “Dealers”) specified in the Purchase
 


  


  





  


 
Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2012 (the “Certificate Purchase Agreement”), between the Purchaser and Initial Purchasers.
 
The sale and conveyance of the Mortgage Loans is being conducted on an arms-length basis and upon commercially reasonable terms.  As the purchase price for the Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Seller or at the Seller’s direction $93,795,855.11, plus accrued interest on the Mortgage Loans from and including June 1, 2012 to but excluding the Closing Date (but subject to certain post-settlement adjustment for expenses incurred by the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Depositor and for which the Seller is specifically responsible).
 
The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on the Closing Date.
 
SECTION 2      Books and Records; Certain Funds Received After the Cut-Off Date.  From and after the sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, record title to each Mortgage and the related Note shall be transferred to the Trustee subject to and in accordance with this Agreement.  Any funds due after the Cut-Off Date in connection with a Mortgage Loan received by the Seller shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Trustee as the owner of such Mortgage Loan and shall be transferred promptly to the Certificate Administrator.  All scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date but collected after the Cut-Off Date, and all recoveries and payments of principal and interest collected on or before the Cut-Off Date (only in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-Off Date and principal prepayments thereon), shall belong to, and shall be promptly remitted to, the Seller.
 
The transfer of each Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Seller’s balance sheets and other financial statements as the sale of such Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser.  The Seller intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser as a sale for tax purposes.  Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller shall not take any actions inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser and its assignees.
 
The transfer of each Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Purchaser’s balance sheets and other financial statements as the purchase of such Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser from the Seller.  The Purchaser intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan from the Seller as a purchase for tax purposes.  The Purchaser shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a set of records for each Mortgage Loan which shall be clearly marked to reflect the transfer of ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
 
SECTION 3     Delivery of Mortgage Loan Documents; Additional Costs and Expenses.  (a)  The Purchaser hereby directs the Seller, and the Seller hereby agrees, such agreement effective upon the transfer of the Mortgage Loans contemplated herein, to deliver or cause to be delivered to the Custodian (on behalf of the Certificate Administrator) on the dates set forth in Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, all documents, instruments and agreements required to be delivered by the Purchaser, or contemplated to be delivered by the

Seller (whether at the direction of the Purchaser or otherwise), to the Custodian with respect to the Mortgage Loans under Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and meeting all the requirements of such Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that the Seller shall not be required to deliver any draft documents, privileged communications, credit underwriting, due diligence analyses or data or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations.
 
(b)          The Seller shall deliver to the Master Servicer within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date a copy of the Mortgage File and documents and records not otherwise required to be contained in the Mortgage File that (i) relate to the origination and/or servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans, (ii) are reasonably necessary for the ongoing administration and/or servicing of the Mortgage Loans (including any asset summaries related to the Mortgage Loans that were delivered to the Rating Agencies in connection with the rating of the Certificates) or for evidencing or enforcing any of the rights of the holder of the Mortgage Loans or holders of interests therein and (iii) are in the possession or under the control of the Seller, together with (x) all unapplied Escrow Payments in the possession or under control of the Seller that relate to the Mortgage Loans and (y) a statement indicating which Escrow Payments are allocable to each Mortgage Loan; provided that the Seller shall not be required to deliver any draft documents, privileged or other communications, credit underwriting, due diligence analyses or data or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations.
 
SECTION 4     Treatment as a Security Agreement.  Pursuant to Section 1 hereof, the Seller has conveyed to the Purchaser all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans.  The parties intend that such conveyance of the Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a purchase and sale and not a loan.  If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale, then the parties also intend and agree that the Seller shall be deemed to have granted, and in such event does hereby grant, to the Purchaser, a first priority security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans, all payments of principal or interest on such Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-Off Date, all other payments made in respect of such Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any event, excluding scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date) and all proceeds thereof, and that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.  If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale, the Seller consents to the Purchaser hypothecating and transferring such security interest in favor of the Trustee and transferring the obligation secured thereby to the Trustee.
 
SECTION 5     Covenants of the Seller.  The Seller covenants with the Purchaser as follows:
 
(a)           it shall record or cause a third party to record in the appropriate public recording office for real property the assignments of assignment of leases, rents and profits and the assignments of Mortgage and each related UCC-2 and UCC-3 financing statement referred to in the definition of Mortgage File from the Seller to the Trustee as and to the extent contemplated under Section 2.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  All out of pocket costs and expenses relating to the recordation or filing of such assignments, assignments of Mortgage and financing statements shall be paid by the Seller.  If any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect

therein, then the Seller shall prepare a substitute therefor or cure such defect or cause such to be done, as the case may be, and the Seller shall deliver such substitute or corrected document or instrument to the Certificate Administrator (or, if the Mortgage Loan is then no longer subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the then holder of such Mortgage Loan);

 
(b)          it shall take any action reasonably required by the Purchaser, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Master Servicer in order to assist and facilitate the transfer of the servicing of the Mortgage Loans to the Master Servicer, including effectuating the transfer of any letters of credit with respect to any Mortgage Loan to the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders and the holders of any related Companion Loans.  Prior to the date that a letter of credit with respect to any Mortgage Loan is transferred to the Master Servicer, the Seller will cooperate with the reasonable requests of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in connection with effectuating a draw under such letter of credit as required under the terms of the related Loan Documents;
 
(c)           the Seller shall provide the Master Servicer the initial data with respect to each Mortgage Loan for the CREFC Financial File and the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File that are required to be prepared by the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Supplemental Servicer Schedule;
 
(d)           if (during the period of time that the Underwriters are required, under applicable law, to deliver a prospectus related to the Public Certificates in connection with sales of the Public Certificates by an Underwriter or a dealer) the Seller has obtained actual knowledge of undisclosed or corrected information related to an event that occurred prior to the Closing Date, which event causes there to be an untrue statement of a material fact with respect to the Seller Information in the Prospectus Supplement dated May 18, 2012 relating to the Public Certificates, the annexes and exhibits thereto and the DVD delivered therewith, or the Offering Circular dated May 18, 2012 relating to the Private Certificates, the annexes and exhibits thereto and the DVD delivered therewith (collectively, the “Offering Documents”), or causes there to be an omission to state therein a material fact with respect to the Seller Information required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein with respect to the Seller Information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Seller shall promptly notify the Dealers and the Depositor. If as a result of any such event the Dealers’ legal counsel determines that it is necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Documents in order to correct the untrue statement, or to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Offering Documents are delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or to make the Offering Documents in compliance with applicable law, the Seller shall (to the extent that such amendment or supplement solely relates to the Seller Information) at the expense of the Seller, do all things reasonably necessary to assist the Depositor to prepare and furnish to the Dealers, such amendments or supplements to the Offering Documents as may be necessary so that the statements in the Offering Documents, as so amended or supplemented, will not contain an untrue statement, will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Offering Documents are delivered to a purchaser, be misleading and will comply with applicable law.  (All terms under this clause (d) and not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2012, among the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the Seller and the Purchaser (the “Indemnification Agreement” and, together with this Agreement, the “Operative Documents”)); and

continue beyond the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date.  Any such repurchase of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a servicing released basis.  The Seller shall have no obligation to monitor the Mortgage Loans regarding the existence of a Breach or a Document Defect, but if the Seller discovers a Material Breach or Material Document Defect with respect to a Mortgage Loan, it will notify the Purchaser.
 
Subject to the Seller’s right to cure set forth above in this Section 6(e), and further subject to Sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, failure of the Seller to deliver the documents referred to in clauses (1)(A), (2), (7), (8), (18) and (19) in the definition of “Mortgage File” in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in accordance with this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for any Mortgage Loan shall be deemed a Material Document Defect; provided, however, that no Document Defect (except such deemed Material Document Defect described above) shall be considered to be a Material Document Defect unless the document with respect to which the Document Defect exists is required in connection with an imminent enforcement of the lender’s rights or remedies under the related Mortgage Loan, defending any claim asserted by any Mortgagor or third party with respect to the Mortgage Loan, establishing the validity or priority of any lien on any collateral securing the Mortgage Loan or for any immediate significant servicing obligation.
 
(f)           In connection with any repurchase or substitution of one or more Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Section 6, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall provide that the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each tender to the repurchasing entity, upon delivery to each of them of a receipt executed by the repurchasing entity, all portions of the Mortgage File and other documents and Escrow Payments pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, and each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File shall be endorsed or assigned to the extent necessary or appropriate to the repurchasing or substituting entity or its designee in the same manner, but only if the respective documents have been previously assigned or endorsed to the Trustee, and pursuant to appropriate forms of assignment, substantially similar to the manner and forms pursuant to which such documents were previously assigned to the Trustee or as otherwise reasonably requested to effect the retransfer and reconveyance of the Mortgage Loan and the security therefor to the Seller or its designee; provided that such tender by the Trustee shall be conditioned upon its receipt from the Master Servicer of a Request for Release and an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the requirements for repurchase or substitution have been satisfied.
 
(g)           The representations and warranties of the parties hereto shall survive the execution and delivery and any termination of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of the respective parties, notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified endorsement on the Notes or Assignment of Mortgage or the examination of the Mortgage Files.
 
(h)           Each party hereto agrees to promptly notify the other party of any breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 6(c) of this Agreement.  The Seller’s obligation to cure any Material Breach or Material Document Defect or to repurchase or substitute any affected Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 6 shall constitute the sole remedy available to the Purchaser in connection with a breach of any of the Seller’s representations or warranties contained in Section 6(c) of this Agreement or a Document Defect with respect to any Mortgage Loan.

MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
 


  


B-1





  


 
 
 
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 




(1)


Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans.  Except with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan.  Each Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan is a senior portion of a whole mortgage loan evidenced by a senior note.  At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Depositor, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement and rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement.  Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to Depositor constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan other than the rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement.



 




(2)


Loan Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the Mortgagee’s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Standard Qualifications”).



 
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Mortgagor with respect to any of the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the Mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.
 


  


  





  


 




(3)


Mortgage Provisions.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.



 




(4)


Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications.  Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related Mortgagor nor the related guarantor has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan.



 




(5)


Lien; Valid Assignment.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases to the Trust Fund constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Trust Fund.  Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the related Mortgagor.  Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Mortgagor’s fee (or if identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions to paragraph (6) set forth on Exhibit C (each such exception, a “Title Exception”)), except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-Off Date, to the Seller’s knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics’ liens, recorded materialmen’s liens and other recorded encumbrances which are prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Seller’s knowledge and subject to the rights of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions), no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection.



 




(6)


Permitted Liens; Title Insurance.  Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable

jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the “Title Policy”) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments due and payable but not yet delinquent; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; (f) if the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan contained in the same Cross-Collateralized Group; and (g) if the related Mortgage Loan is part of a Whole Loan, the rights of the holder of the related Companion Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement; provided that none of which items (a) through (g), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Mortgagor’s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the “Permitted Encumbrances”).  Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage.  Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller’s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.




 




(7)


Junior Liens.  It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, there are no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmens liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing).  Except as set forth on Exhibit C, the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Mortgagor.



 




(8)


Assignment of Leases and Rents.  There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Mortgagor to exercise certain rights

and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.  The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related Mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the Mortgagee.




 




(9)


UCC Filings.  If the related Mortgaged Property is operated as a hospitality property, the Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Mortgagor and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above.  No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection.



 




(10)


Condition of Property.  Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within thirteen months of the Cut-Off Date.



 
An engineering report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than thirteen months prior to the Cut-Off Date.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than deferred maintenance for which escrows were established at origination) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
 




(11)


Taxes and Assessments.  All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, which could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-Off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon.  For purposes

of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority.



 





(12)


Condemnation.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller’s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-Off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(13)


Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgagor’s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such Mortgagor’s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Mortgagor’s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor’s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(14)


Escrow Deposits.  All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with Mortgagee pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with Mortgagee under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Depositor or its servicer.



 




(15)


No Holdbacks.  The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Mortgagor or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such holdback).



 




(16)


Insurance.  Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a “special cause of loss form” or “all risk form” that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least “A-:VIII” from A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or “A-” from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service (collectively the “Insurance Rating Requirements”), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the



 


  


5





  


 
full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Mortgagor and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
 
Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
 
If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as “a Special Flood Hazard Area”, the related Mortgagor  is required to maintain insurance  in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
 
If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related Mortgagor is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or “named storms” issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.
 
The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by prudent institutional commercial mortgage lenders, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
 
An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit (“SEL”) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an insurer rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or “A-”  by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL.
 
The Loan Documents require insurance proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged
 


  


6





  


 
Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan, the Mortgagee (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
 
All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-Off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the Mortgagee under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee.  Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance and, at such Mortgagor’s failure to do so, authorizes the Mortgagee to maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor’s reasonable cost and expense and to charge such Mortgagor for related premiums.  All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days’ prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.
 




(17)


Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots.  Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access  via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.



 




(18)


No Encroachments.  To Seller’s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the Mortgagee’s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements encroach upon any easements except



 


  


7





  


 
for encroachments the removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with respect to the Title Policy.
 




(19)


No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation.  No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature (except that an ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess of the rate in effect prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date) or an equity participation by Seller.



 




(20)


REMIC.  The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Mortgagor at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date, provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)).  If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly modified” prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause (B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto.  Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(2).  All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.



 




(21)


Compliance with Usury Laws.  The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.



 




(22)


Authorized to do Business.  To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-Off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage Note was authorized to originate, acquire and/or hold (as applicable) the Mortgage Note in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or



 


  


8





  


 
the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.
 




(23)


Trustee under Deed of Trust.  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related Mortgagee.



 




(24)


Local Law Compliance.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect’s letter, a zoning consultant’s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan, as applicable) and as of the Cut-Off Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively “Zoning Regulations”) other than those which (i) are insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance insurance policy or (ii) would not have a material adverse effect on the value, operation or net operating income of the Mortgaged Property.  The terms of the Loan Documents require the Mortgagor to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.



 




(25)


Licenses and Permits.  Each Mortgagor covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller’s knowledge based upon any of a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.  The Mortgage Loan requires the related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located.



 




(26)


Recourse Obligations.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan (a) becomes full recourse to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis) in any of the following events: (i) if any voluntary petition for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by the Mortgagor; (ii) Mortgagor or guarantor shall have colluded with (or, alternatively, solicited or caused to be solicited) other creditors to cause an involuntary bankruptcy filing with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii) voluntary transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or equity interests in Mortgagor made in violation of the Loan Documents; and (b) contains provisions providing for



 


  


9





  


 
recourse against the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis), for losses and damages sustained by reason of Mortgagor’s (i) misappropriation of rents after the occurrence of an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, (ii) misappropriation of (A) insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or (B) security deposits or, alternatively, the failure of any security deposits to be delivered to Mortgagee upon foreclosure or action in lieu thereof (except to the extent applied in accordance with leases prior to a Mortgage Loan event of default); (iii) fraud or intentional material misrepresentation; (iv) breaches of the environmental covenants in the Loan Documents; or (v) commission of intentional material physical waste at the Mortgaged Property.
 




(27)


Mortgage Releases.  The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, or partial Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance defined in (32) below, (d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any material value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation or taking by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof.  With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such release of collateral (i) would not constitute a “significant modification” of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii) would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3)(A) of the Code; or (y) the Mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Loan Documents, condition such release of collateral on the related Mortgagor’s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause (x).  For purposes of the preceding clause (x), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December 6, 2010, if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan outstanding after the release, the Mortgagor is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.



 
With respect to any partial release under the preceding clause (e), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December 6, 2010, the Mortgagor can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the real property
 


  


10





  


 
constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan.
 
No Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties, other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
 




(28)


Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls.  Each Mortgage requires the Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Mortgagor are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the Mortgagor entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members’ capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis.



 




(29)


Acts of Terrorism Exclusion.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (collectively referred to as “TRIA”), from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related special all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller’s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-Off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the Mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto; provided, however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the Mortgagor under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Mortgagor shall not be required to spend more than the Terrorism Cap Amount on terrorism insurance coverage, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds the Terrorism Cap Amount, the Mortgagor is required to purchase the maximum amount  of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to the Terrorism Cap Amount.  The “Terrorism Cap Amount”  is the specified percentage (which is at least equal to 200%)  of the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time  in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance).

(30)


Due on Sale or Encumbrance.  Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a “due on sale” or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the Mortgagee which are customarily acceptable to prudent commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Mortgagor, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related Mortgagor, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Mortgagor, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) herein or the exceptions thereto set forth on Exhibit C, or (vii) as set forth on Exhibit B-30-1 by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on Exhibit B-30-2 or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests (iii) any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as set forth on Exhibit B-30-3 or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.  The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.



 




(31)


Single-Purpose Entity.  Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding.  Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the Mortgagor with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-Off Date Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Mortgagor is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-Off Date Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel’s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Mortgagor.  For this purpose, a “Single-Purpose Entity” shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-Off Date Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any



 


  


12





  


 

business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity.

 




(32)


Defeasance.  With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can be defeased (a “Defeasance”), (i) the Loan Documents provide for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Loan Documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Mortgagor is permitted to pledge only United States “government securities” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty) or, if the Mortgage Loan is an ARD Loan, the entire principal balance outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the Mortgage Loan permits partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; (iv) the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Note as set forth in (iii) above, (v) if the Mortgagor would continue to own assets in addition to the defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral is required to be assumed (or the Mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vi) the Mortgagor is required to provide an opinion of counsel that the Mortgagee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or interest; and (vii) the Mortgagor is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with defeasance (if rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountant’s fees and opinions of counsel.



 




(33)


Fixed Interest Rates.  Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in the case of ARD loans and situations where default interest is imposed.



 




(34)


Ground Leases.   For purposes of this Agreement, a “Ground Lease” shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground



 


  


13





  


 
lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.
 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor’s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns, Seller represents and warrants that:
 




  


(a)


The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.  The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage.  No material change in the terms of the Ground Lease had occurred since the origination of the Mortgage Loan, except as reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;



 




  


(b)


The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or  modified, or canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee;



 




  


(c)


The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Mortgagor or the Mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);



 




  


(d)


The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii)  is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the Mortgagee on the lessor’s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;



 




  


(e)


The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonably restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder (provided that proper notice is delivered to the extent required in accordance with such Ground Lease), and in the event it is so assigned, it is



 


  


14





  


 
further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of (but with prior notice to) the lessor;
 




  


(f)


The Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.  To the Seller’s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller’s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;



 




  


(g)


The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the Mortgagee written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the Mortgagee unless such notice is given to the Mortgagee;



 




  


(h)


The Mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the Mortgagee’s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;



 




  


(i)

(k)


In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee’s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and

(41)


Appraisal.  The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6 months of the Mortgage Loan origination date, and within 12 months of the Closing Date.  The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is a Member of the Appraisal Institute (“MAI”) and, to the Seller’s knowledge, had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Mortgagor or in any loan made on the security thereof, and whose compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan.

For purposes of these representations and warranties, the phrases “the Seller’s knowledge” or “the Seller’s belief” and other words and phrases of like import shall mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth herein, the actual state of knowledge or belief of the Seller, its officers and employees directly responsible for the underwriting, origination, servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding the matters expressly set forth herein.

Description of Exception



 
 
 
 
 


(7)     Junior Liens

 

Little Palm Island (No. 34)

 

With respect to the Mortgaged Property, the related Sponsors have entered into a credit facility in which the related Sponsors pledged, among other things, their equity interests in the related Mortgagor and the general partner of the related Mortgagor.


 
 
 
 
 


(17)   Access; Utilities; Separate Tax  Lots

 

Little Palm Island (No. 34)

 

The Mortgaged Property is not located on or adjacent to a public road nor has direct legal access to a public road.  The Mortgaged Property is accessible only by boat.


 
 
 
 
 


(24)   Local Law Compliance

 

35 Ryerson Street (No. 43)

 

There are currently twenty-five (25) open building code violations at the Mortgaged Property, which include life-safety, elevator and ADA repairs.  Both the Mortgagor and the guarantor have delivered a violations indemnity and undertaking agreement which requires both the Mortgagor and guarantor to indemnify the lender in connection with these violations.  The Mortgagor further agreed to take all commercially reasonable steps to cause the violations to be removed as matters of record.


 
 
 
 
 


(26)   Recourse Obligations

 

545 Long Wharf Drive (No. 14)

 

Provided that the Mortgagor maintains a blanket environmental insurance policy and names the lender as an additional insured, the related mortgage loan documents provide that the lender agrees to delay enforcement of its rights under the related environmental indemnity agreement until the earlier of final settlement or denial of a claim under the environmental insurance policy or six (6) months from notice to lender of any environmental liabilities.


 
 
 
 
 


(34)   Ground Leases

 

Little Palm Island (No. 34)

 

The Mortgage Loan is secured by a Mortgaged Property which consists, in part, of a leasehold estate.  The related Borrower has an insured leasehold interest in docks located on submerged lands pursuant to a submerged lands lease with the State of Florida.  Such submerged lands lease is scheduled to expire on January 26, 2029.
 
In accordance with the common practice in the State of Florida for leases of this type, the submerged lands lease does not contain any of the standard mortgagee protections articulated in the related representation.
 
In addition, pursuant to a shore station lease with an affiliate of the related borrower, the related Borrower has a leasehold interest in a shore station on the mainland which is the departure point for boats transporting patrons to the island resort pursuant to a shore station lease with an affiliate of the related Borrower. Neither the shore station lease nor a memorandum thereof has been recorded in the applicable jurisdiction. The shore station lease and the related documents provide that any insurance proceeds and condemnation awards will be payable to the lessor; however, the related Mortgage Loan documents require the related Borrower to cause any third party to endorse any insurance proceeds over to the related lender. Further, although the shore station lease and related documents provide lender with notice and cure rights, the shore station lease does not provide lender the express right to enter into a new lease directly with the lessor in the event the shore station lease is terminated.

Exhibit 33.7


ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA


Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Company”) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the period as follows:


Platform:  Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding any such securities issued by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government (other than the Federal Deposit Insurance Company) or any government sponsored entity, and further excluding the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the “Platform”).  Appendix
A identifies the individual transactions defined by the Company as constituting the Platform.


Applicable Servicing Criteria:  All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, or required by the Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company, except for the following criteria:  1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which Management has determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (“the Applicable Servicing Criteria”).


Period:  As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 (the “Period”).


Third parties classified as vendors:  With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criterion.  The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a “servicer” as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (“Interpretation 17.06”).  The
Company has policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor’s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor.  The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criterion.


With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
 
1.  The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.
 
2.  The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above.  In performing this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.
 
3.  Based on such assessment, the Company has complied, in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, except as described in Schedule A hereto.
 
4.  Schedule B hereto includes Management's discussion of the exceptions noted in Schedule A, including remediation efforts taken by the Company.
 
As discussed in Appendix B, the Company has amended its Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria dated February 28, 2013 to include certain previously omitted transactions in its Platform.


KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Exhibit 33.7





Schedule A


Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company


Management’s assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of December 31, 2012 and for the Period, disclosed that material instances of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criteria set forth in both of Items 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(ii), as follows:




·  


With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), certain reports to investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements.



 




·  


With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii), certain amounts due to investors were not allocated and remitted in accordance with timeframes, distribution priority and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements.



 
Schedule B


Management’s Discussion on Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company


Disclosure:  During the Period, Wells Fargo identified Payment Errors (as defined below) and Reporting Errors (as defined below) on certain residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) transactions in the Platform.  Although no individually identified error, in and of itself, was found to be material to the Platform, when the errors were considered in the aggregate, Management determined that, for Platform purposes, there were material instances of noncompliance with respect to both Items 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB.


For purposes of this Schedule B, the term “Payment Errors” means the identified payment errors that occurred during the Period and that, when considered in the aggregate, led to Management’s determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the Platform with respect to Item 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) of Regulation AB.  For purposes of this Schedule B, the term “Reporting Errors” means the identified reporting errors that occurred during the Period and that, when considered in the aggregate, led to Management’s determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the Platform with respect to Item 1122(d)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB.


The identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors on such RMBS transactions were attributable to certain failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting that, although adapted over time, still insufficiently addressed the impact of the unprecedented levels of collateral degradation in RMBS transactions on the calculation of principal and interest payments and losses and associated investor reporting.
 
 
Scope of the Material Instances of Noncompliance:  The identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that led to Management’s determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the Platform had occurred were limited to certain RMBS transactions in the Platform.  There were no identified Payment Errors or Reporting Errors for non-RMBS transactions in the Platform which contributed to Management’s determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform.  In some instances, the identified Payment Errors which contributed to Management’s determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform were also considered material to the transactions on which they occurred.  None of the identified Reporting Errors which contributed to Management’s determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform were considered
material for a particular transaction.  For all transactions in the Platform (including RMBS transactions with identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors), Management delivered an Item 1123 certification to the extent it was required to do so pursuant to the requirements of the applicable transaction documents and Regulation AB.  Where there was an identified Payment Error that was considered material for an individual transaction, the Item 1123 certification included a description of the nature and scope of such error.


Remediation:  Appropriate actions have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate the identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that led to Management’s determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the Platform had occurred.  Further, adjustments have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the RMBS transactions in the Platform to minimize the risk of future payment and reporting errors.


Further Disclosure1:  Earlier this year, the Staff of the Securities Exchange Commission issued a comment letter to an issuer of certain residential mortgage-backed securities with questions regarding its 2012 Form 10-K filings.  Three of the questions posed on such comment letter pertained to Wells Fargo’s Schedule B discussion of the material instances of noncompliance on its platform set forth above.  The comment letter questions and Wells Fargo’s response to such questions  are set forth verbatim below beginning with the second succeeding paragraph (the “Comment Letter Questions and Wells Fargo Responses”).


The statistics about Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors (as such terms are defined in the responses below) set forth in Wells Fargo’s responses below were based on information known as of February 28, 2013, the date of the original

Exhibit 33.7


 
Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.  As of the date of this amended assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, Management is aware of an additional 18 Identified Payment Errors and an additional 29 Identified Reporting Errors.  The additional errors were found both on platform transactions that are denoted as omitted transactions on Appendix A hereto and on non-omitted platform transactions.  The discussion in the below responses about the Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors, including statements about remediation, is applicable to these additional Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors.

·  


the specific failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting;





Response:  Wells Fargo develops a unique Model for each transaction in its Platform.  On the whole, there are millions of calculations performed by the Models each payment period for the thousands of transactions in the Platform.


Wells Fargo’s waterfall payment calculation and reporting functions can be categorized into three processes:
 




Ø  


Model Inputs,







Ø  


Model Programs, and







Ø  


transmission of each Model’s output to the processes and systems that generate investor reports.



 
In the 2012 Reporting Period, there were 84 Identified Payment Errors on RMBS transactions3.
 




Ø  


40 of the 84 Identified Payment Errors resulted from Model Input Errors.  For example4, in certain transactions, defaulted fixed rate loans became subject to unanticipated rate modifications when the loans were modified in accordance with industry loan modification initiatives.  Because the transaction documents did not contemplate the rate modifications, the Model Input process had to be manually adapted to incorporate the rate changes.  Model Input Errors occurred when the manual adjustments were made.



 




Ø  


44 of the 84 Identified Payment Errors resulted from Model Program Errors.  For example, in many RMBS transactions, at the point credit support is depleted (i.e. the principal balance of the subordinate bonds is reduced to zero), payment allocations to the remaining senior bonds shift from a sequential payment priority to a pro rata payment priority.  In many cases, the transaction documents require such shift to occur “on and after” the month in which credit support is depleted and in other transactions the shift occurs “after” the month in which credit support is depleted.  Model Program Errors occurred when some Model Programs shifted payment allocations from sequential to pro rata in the wrong month inconsistent with the applicable transaction documents.  In addition, with respect to transaction documents which direct the payment priority shift “on and after” credit support depletion,
Model Program Errors occurred because proper effect was not given to the word “on”.  There is an order of operations in every waterfall that directs payments to bonds first and allocations of losses to bonds second.  Because credit support depletion most often occurs from the allocation of losses to subordinate bonds, this order of operation (i.e. payments first; losses second) would have to be reversed to make a payment priority shift on the credit support depletion date.  Model Program Errors occurred when the order of operations was not reversed in this manner.



 





 

3 While there were also some Identified Payment Errors on CMBS and ABS transactions in the Platform, Schedule B to the 2012 Assessment says “[T]he identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that led to Management’s determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the Platform had occurred was limited to certain RMBS transactions in the Platform.  There were no identified Payment Errors or Reporting Errors for non-RMBS transactions in the Platform which contributed to Management’s determination that there were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform”.  Accordingly, the statistics provided in this response relating to Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors are limited to RMBS transactions in the Platform.
  
4 Because it would be impractical to provide a detailed explanation of each of the 84 Identified Payment Errors, Wells Fargo has endeavored in its responses to questions 5, 6 and 7 to provide meaningful examples of the Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors.  The examples are illustrative but not representative of every individual error or error type.
 



  


  





  
Exhibit 33.7


 

For the 2012 Reporting Period, there were 148 Identified Reporting Errors on RMBS transactions5.
 




Ø  


84 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from the 84 Identified Payment Errors.  Inaccurate payments led to inaccurate reporting.



 




Ø  


64 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors were unrelated to the Identified Payment Errors.











 









o  


36 of the 64 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from inaccurate/incomplete bond reporting.  Some examples of these 36 Identified Reporting Errors include inaccurate reporting variables related to investor payments, incorrect tranche balance reporting and incorrect trigger reporting.







 














o  


28 of the 64 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from inaccurate/incomplete mortgage loan reporting.  Some examples of these 28 Identified Reporting Errors include incorrect information on the collateral statement portion of the investor report, inaccurate delinquency reporting and inaccurate loan level performance reporting.



 





·  


what you mean by “unprecedented levels of collateral degradation” and why that would have any effect on the calculation of the waterfall; and





Response: “Unprecedented levels of collateral degradation” refers to the significant decrease in mortgage loan performance experienced by RMBS transactions generally over the past several years.  The significant decrease in loan performance is evidenced by the fact that over 50 percent of the RMBS transactions in Wells Fargo’s Platform have reached credit support depletion.  This is a significant event because waterfall payment priorities for the senior bonds typically change at that point.


One reason why high levels of RMBS mortgage loan performance degradation affect waterfall calculations is because such degradation contributes to Model Input Errors.  One example of such Model Input Errors relates to the extensive level of mortgage loan delinquencies and the resulting extensive levels of servicer advancing.  High levels of advancing lead to both high advance recoveries by servicers in single distribution periods and increased servicer stop advance decisions.6  These phenomena require manual processing which can result in Model Input Errors.


The high level of RMBS mortgage loan performance degradation has also contributed to Model Program Errors.  The extensive collateral losses in RMBS transactions have triggered waterfall scenarios that were considered unlikely to occur at the inception of the transactions (if they were considered at all) and were not as clearly detailed as other provisions in the transaction agreements that direct waterfall calculations and distributions.  At Model creation, those waterfall scenarios were not forecasted to reach the levels of underperformance that RMBS mortgage loans have experienced.   Because of such lack of forecasting and the absence of benchmark data7 for such scenarios from the underwriters/sponsors of the transactions or other sources, Wells Fargo was unable to test and validate such waterfall scenarios.  As a result, Model Program Errors occurred.






·  


what you mean by “adapted over time.”





Response:  “Adapted over time” refers to the fact that Model Programs and Model Inputs and the processes related to Model Programs and Model Inputs are, over the life of a transaction, constantly being adjusted in an effort to ensure accurate payments.  Continual adjustments are required because the transactions and securities to which the Models relate are very complex and the technology and processes related to Model Programs and Model Inputs are equally complex.  The level of adjustment needed for Model Programs, Model Inputs, and related processes increased as mortgage loan performance degradation increased.


6. We note reference to “Payment Errors” and “Reporting Errors.” With a view towards disclosure, please explain whether these are the same type of Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that were described in Wells Fargo’s assessment of compliance for 2011 that you further described in a response to us on December 31, 2012. In that response letter, Wells Fargo confirmed the correction and resolution of modeling errors and that indicated that adjustments to payments were made in 2012. If these are not the same type of errors as those that occurred in 2011, please state so. In either case, with a view towards disclosure, please explain:
 





 

5 See footnote 1.
  
6 A stop advance decision is made by a servicer when, with respect to any advance made in the past or any proposed future advance, it determines that such advances will not be recoverable from collections on the loan or from liquidation proceeds.

  
7 There were principally two types of benchmark data used:  decrement tables and underwriter/sponsor cash flow projections.  The decrement tables in offering documents generally only projected out at pricing speeds with zero loss assumptions.  Reconciling Models with those decrement tables based on those assumptions would not have exposed the stresses on the Model Programs resulting from the significant mortgage loan performance degradation in recent years. In addition, cash flow projections received from the underwriters/sponsors at the time of deal issuance were projected at minimal losses which were not severe enough to expose the stresses on the Model Programs resulting from the significant collateral degradation in recent years.




  


  





  
Exhibit 33.7



 
General Response:  The Identified Payment Errors and the Identified Reporting Errors were generally similar in type to the payment and reporting errors that led to the determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance for the 2011 assessment of compliance.  However, the transactions on which the errors occurred and the exact circumstances and details giving rise to the Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors in 2012 were different than 2011.  The correction of the 2011 identified payment errors and reporting errors was specific to the Models for the affected transactions and such corrections do not preclude the possibility that a similar type of error would occur on a different transaction with a different Model in 2012.


Examples of Model Program Errors that occurred similarly in both years involve (i) post-credit support depletion loss allocation methodology and payment priority rules (e.g., pro rata versus sequential), and (ii) the calculation of group-directed cash flows, interest calculation elements (rate, accrual day logic, etc.), and pre-credit support depletion loss allocation.


Examples of Model Input Errors that occurred similarly in both years involve (i) improper coding of cash adjustments and using incorrect prior month data, (ii) loan modification inputs related to capitalization of delinquent amounts and the recovery of advances related thereto and modified interest rates in certain transaction structures, and (iii) cash adjustments related to servicer advance reimbursements that caused errors in certain calculations (e.g., the net weighted average coupon rate calculations).


Comparing the Identified Reporting Errors to the identified reporting errors in 2011, a substantial number in each year were caused by the payment errors (i.e., reporting an incorrect payment). There were other reporting errors in both years that related to missing and incorrect bond information and missing and incorrect mortgage loan information.






·  


whether the payment errors resulted in overpayments or underpayments to investors;





Response:  In most cases, the Identified Payment Errors were a combination of overpayments to one or more classes of investors or transaction parties and corresponding underpayments to one or more other classes of investors or other transaction parties.  Therefore, most of the Identified Payment Errors consisted of overpayments and underpayments that netted to zero because all the cash that was received from a transaction party in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date8.






·  


the types of reporting errors that occurred and how they related to the payment errors;





Response:  84 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors were caused by the Identified Payment Errors in that the incorrect payment led to incorrect reporting.  Since the Identified Payment Errors were calculated incorrectly, the payments were reported incorrectly.  The remaining 64 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors were not caused by the Identified Payment Errors.  Those 64 Identified Reporting Errors consisted of missing or inaccurate information related to various bond reporting and mortgage loan reporting elements.






·  


whether investors whose payments were impacted were notified of the errors and, if so, how they were notified;





Response:  Investors received notice of the Identified Payment Errors by means of the posting to Wells Fargo’s website of corrected payment date statements.  Investors received notice of Investor Reporting Errors by either a revised statement in connection with a restatement9 of the affected distributions or by correcting the reporting error on the next payment date statement.






·  


whether any underpayments were paid or will be paid to investors and, if so, when the payments were made or will be made; and



 






  
8 While most Identified Payment Errors netted to zero, a small number of the Identified Payment Errors did not net to zero.  Identified Payment Errors that did not net to zero occurred when, inadvertently, either (i) less than 100 percent the cash that was received from a transaction party (such as a servicer) in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date leaving cash in the transaction’s distribution account or (ii) an amount greater than 100 percent of the cash that was received from a transaction party (such as a servicer) in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date causing an overdraft of the transaction’s distribution account.  The scenario described in clause (i) explains the majority of circumstances where overpayments and underpayments did not net to zero.

  
9 As used in this response, the term “restatement” and the phrase “restating affected distribution periods” means the correction of an overpayment or underpayment experienced by a class of book-entry securities by (i) submitting a revised payment date statement for each affected distribution period to the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) by which the DTC adjusts the accounts of the overpaid and underpaid classes, and (ii) the posting of such revised payment date statement to Wells Fargo’s website.  In accordance with its current policy, the DTC revises up to twelve months of affected distributions.  On a limited number of occasions when the affected distribution periods extended beyond such twelve month time frame, Wells Fargo included adjustments for the additional distribution periods
in the restatement of the twelve distribution periods and notified investors of this fact on the revised payment date statements.  The process is similar for physical securities except that Wells Fargo interacts directly with affected holders as opposed to interacting with the DTC.


 


  


  





  
Exhibit 33.7


 
Response:  With one exception10, Identified Payment Errors that resulted in underpayments to investors were rectified by means of restating affected distribution periods.  The restatements occurred between February 1, 2012 and March 1, 2013.






·  


whether any future payments were adjusted to account for overpayments.





Response:    With one exception described in footnote 8, Identified Payment Errors that resulted in overpayments to investors were rectified by restating the affected distribution periods.  Except with respect to one Identified Payment Error on one transaction unrelated to the transactions to which the Comment Letter relates, no future payments were adjusted in connection with overpayment errors.  In that one case, distributions to one class of certificates were adjusted over three distribution dates and such adjustment was disclosed on the respective distribution date statements.


7. While we note that Wells Fargo further states that “[a]ppropriate actions have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate” the identified errors and “adjustments have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the RMBS transactions in the Platform to minimize the risk of future payment and reporting errors.” This disclosure, however, does not provide any indication as to the nature and scope of the failures, or the impact of the identified material instances of noncompliance. We believe a more granular discussion is necessary to understand how these steps have addressed the identified material instances of noncompliance. With a view towards disclosure, please explain:






·  


the specific actions that have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate the identified payment errors and reporting errors;





Response:   Except as discussed in footnote 8, Wells Fargo has remediated all of the 84 Identified Payment Errors through restatements of the affected distribution periods. The restatements occurred between February 1, 2012 and March 1, 2013.  Wells Fargo has remediated all 148 Identified Reporting Errors by either issuing a revised statement in connection with a restatement of the affected payments or by ensuring that the reporting element in question was correctly reported on the next payment date statement.






·  


the specific adjustments that have been or will be made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures applied to the RMBS transactions in the platform; and





Response:   Wells Fargo has determined to address not only the specific errors that led to the determination of material instances of non-compliance on the RMBS component of its Platform, but also to take proactive measures to identify other problems with its Models that could cause payment or reporting errors. Accordingly, Wells Fargo has undertaken an expansive project to identify, rectify and prevent problems with its Models and the individual transactions that exhibited these problems.  Wells Fargo is in the early stages of this project.  Due to the size of the RMBS component of its Platform, this is a long term, intensive project involving significant internal and external resources.  In conjunction with other steps taken, Wells Fargo believes that this initiative will result in ongoing improvements to its payment and reporting processes.






·  


any other steps that Wells Fargo has undertaken or will undertake to ensure that similar errors do not occur in the future.





Response:    Throughout 2012 and 2013, Wells Fargo has adopted numerous other initiatives in an effort to add rigor to its operational processes and quality control measures.  The initiatives relate to both preventing Model Errors and identifying and correcting Model Errors.  Examples of measures to prevent Model Errors include, among other things, enhancements to its (i) new Model creation procedures, (ii) procedures for pre-closing review of waterfall language in transaction documents, and (iii) procedures for pre-payment date testing of transaction level payment calculations and reporting elements.  Examples of measures to identify and correct Model Errors include, among other things, (a) enhanced procedures relating to Model revisions, (b) the creation of a team charged with conducting a careful analysis of every Model Error to determine if any additional controls are necessary to prevent the errors
from re-occurring, and (c) the creation of a team to proactively perform Model Program corrections to prevent future Model Errors.  Wells Fargo has hired over two dozen additional staff and reorganized various teams to more effectively manage the above-mentioned operational processes and quality control measures.


Material Instance of Noncompliance by any Vendor
NONE
Material Deficiencies in Company’s Policies and Procedures to Monitor Vendor’s Compliance
NONE
 





  
10 There is one underpayment of $4992.92 (and a corresponding overpayment of the same amount) from March 2012 which has not been remedied.  The underpayment did not occur on any transaction to which the Commission’s Comment Letter directly relates.  Wells Fargo is in the process of determining an appropriate course of action with regard to this underpayment.

Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ9
























CHICAGO, Oct 13, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all rated classes of Goldman Sachs Commercial 
      Mortgage Capital, L.P., GS Mortgage Securities Trust series 2012-GCJ9 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement of the classes 
      relative to Fitch expected losses and the relatively stable performance 
      of the pool since issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.9% of the 
      remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.8%. 
      There have been no realized losses to date. Fitch has designated nine 
      loans (24%) as Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC), which includes two 
      specially serviced assets (0.8%). There are currently 14 loans on the 
      servicer's watchlist (29.9%).


                                        








As of the September 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by approximately 4.8% to $1.32 
      billion from $1.39 billion at issuance. Approximately 60% of the pool's 
      loans are amortizing balloon. There are five loans scheduled to mature 
      in 2017 with a current balance of $191.5 million (14.5% of the pool), 
      including three of the top-15 loans that have had positive performance 
      since issuance. Five loans are fully defeased (2.7% of the pool). There 
      are $235,934 of interest shortfalls affecting class NR.


                                        








The largest contributor to Fitch modelled losses is the Gansevoort Park 
      Avenue hotel loan (4.75% of the pool), which is secured by a boutique 
      luxury hotel located on the corner of Park Avenue and 29th Street in the 
      NoMad section of Manhattan. The loan is on the servicer's watchlist due 
      to a decline in net cash flow (NCF) since issuance. Per the year-end 
      (YE) 2015 OSAR, the NCF was 37% below the issuers underwritten NCF, with 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) declining to 1.11x for YE 2015 from 
      1.42x at YE 2014 and 1.77x at issuance. The declines are attributed to 
      increased expenses, primarily real estate taxes, which have increased to 
      $3.6 million at YE 2015, compared to $3.3 million in 2014, $2.0 million 
      in 2013, and $1.5 million at issuance. The underwritten real estate tax 
      amount was based on an approved tax appeal, but the figure has more than 
      doubled when compared to the issuer's underwriting. In addition, food & 
      beverage (F&B) income has also declined compared to issuance.


                                        








Hotel room revenues remain relatively flat compared to issuance with YE 
      2015 only 2.6% below the issuer's underwritten amount. Occupancy 
      improved to 86.7% as of YE 2015, compared to 83.6% at issuance. However, 
      ADR and RevPAR both declined over the same time period, reporting at 
      $350.58 and $303.95, respectively, compared $386.83 (ADR) and $323.39 
      (RevPAR) at issuance. Although Fitch calculated losses based on in-place 
      cash flow and a stressed cap rate, losses may be mitigated given the 
      strong location and quality of the asset. Fitch is closely monitoring 
      the property's performance.


                                        








Two of the top-15 loans scheduled to mature in 2017 are secured by hotel 
      portfolios: The $88.3 million Cooper Hotel Portfolio (6.7% of the pool; 
      maturing Nov. 2016) collateralized by 11 full service and limited 
      service properties in three states (FL, MI, TN), and the TMI Hotel 
      Portfolio (3.3%; maturing October 2016) secured by 10 limited service 
      and extended stay hotels in eight states (TX, AZ, OH, WY, OK, MI, WI, 
      MN). Both portfolios have experienced significant increases in cash flow 
      since issuance driven by positive operating performance, with increased 
      occupancy, ADR, and/or RevPAR at all properties. Per the 
      trailing-twelve-month (TTM) May 2016 Smith Travel Research (STR) 
      reports, the Cooper Hotel Portfolio's weighted average (WA) occupancy, 
      ADR, and RevPAR were 73.1%, $112.83, and $83, respectively, compared to 
      68.5%, $98.95, and $68.22 at issuance. Per the TTM March 2016 STR 
      reports, the TMI Hotel Portfolio's WA occupancy, ADR, and RevPar were 
      78.5%, $113.82, and $90.41, respectively, compared to 74.6%, $102.92, 
      and $76.77 at YE 2013. All of the properties in both portfolios are 
      currently outperforming or in-line with their respective comp sets.


                                        








The third near-term maturing top-15 loan is the $35.0 million 222 
      Broadway loan (2.7%), maturing in June 2017. The loan is secured by a 
      31-story office tower located in Manhattan's Financial District, 
      directly south of City Hall Park, and adjacent to the new Fulton Street 
      Transit Center and one block east of the new WTC Transportation Hub. The 
      property NOI had a temporary decline in 2014 due to Bank of America (74% 
      of the NRA at issuance) exercising its contraction rights in 2013 and 
      vacating 91,609-sf, downsizing its footprint to 483,977-sf (62% NRA). In 
      2014, the contracted space and existing vacant space was leased to two 
      new tenants, Conde Nast (10.8% NRA) and WeWork(16% NRA), with rent 
      abatements built into both leases through fourth quarter 2014. Occupancy 
      was 97.5% per the March 2016 rent roll. The first quarter 2016 DSCR was 
      2.42x, compared to 2.62x at YE 2015, 1.16x at YE 2014, and 1.49x at YE 
      2013.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks for all but classes B and C are considered Stable 
      due to sufficient credit enhancement (C/E), and relatively stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. The Outlooks for classes B and C 
      are revised to Positive as C/E is expected to improve over the next 13 
      months from on-going monthly amortization and expected repayment from 
      maturing loans. Should performance across the pool continue to improve, 
      class C/E increase, and loans repay as expected, positive rating 
      migrations are possible on these classes. However, should there be 
      material economic or asset level event changes that affect the 
      transaction's portfolio-level metrics, including modelled losses 
      exceeding Fitch expectations or additional loans transferring to special 
      servicing, the classes could be subjected to negative ratings migration.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
