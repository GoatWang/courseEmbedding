TrimTabs Plans 2 Free-Cash-Flow ETFs | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»TrimTabs Plans 2 Free-Cash-Flow ETFsJan.  4, 2015  1:43 PM ET|| Includes: FCFD, FCFIby: Zacks FundsZacks Funds Fund holdings, ETF investingZacks.comTrimTabs ETF Trust has recently filed a post-effective amendment for two ETFs - one focusing on the domestic market and the other on international markets. The funds - TrimTabs International Free-Cash-Flow ETF and TrimTabs U.S. Free-Cash-Flow ETF - are expected to trade under the tickers FCFI and FCFD following their launch.
Below, we have highlighted some of the details about the ETFs for investors seeking to know more about these in-registration funds:
FCFI in Focus
As per the SEC filing, the proposed passively managed ETF looks to provide exposure to international companies poised for rapid growth by tracking the performance of the TrimTabs International Free-Cash-Flow Index before fees and expenses. For this purpose, the index focuses on companies with high free cash flow yield, including REITs.
Free cash flow here refers to the total cash generated by the company after spending the money required to maintain or expand its operations, while free cash flow yield is the ratio of a company's free cash flow to its market capitalization.
The index follows an equal weighted strategy which ensures a well-diversified portfolio. Moreover, the index seeks to provide exposure to 10 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K.
The fund will charge 69 basis points as fees.
FCFD in Focus
The proposed fund looks to track the performance of the TrimTabs U.S. Free-Cash-Flow Index, before fees and expenses. The passively managed fund focuses solely on U.S. companies, including REITs, having a high free cash flow yield.
FCFD in short follows the same strategy as FCFI and also charges the same fees, but with a domestic focus.
How Might it Fit in a Portfolio?
Free cash flow is one of the important tools to measure the performance of a company. Usually most investors focus on fundamental indicators such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), book value, price-to-book (P/B) and the PEG ratio to select companies with strong fundamentals. They often ignore free cash flow measures.

However, the free cash flow yield offers a better representation of the company's performance and in most cases give a fairer picture of the company than other fundamental measures.
FCFI and FCFD, which focus on companies with high cash flow yield, are expected to hold some of the best performing international and domestic companies, respectively.
ETF Competition
Presently, there aren't many funds focusing on this space. However, we have two funds from Cambria - one focused on the domestic space and the other on the international front - providing exposure to companies that generate high free cash flow and in turn look to return these to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, share repurchases, or by reducing their leverage.
Cambria Shareholder Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:SYLD) with an asset base of $218 million is based on the research that free cash flow is a key predictor of a company's strength. This product invests in companies that show strong characteristics in returning free cash flow to their shareholders by way of cash dividends, share repurchases, or by reducing their leverage. The actively managed fund has a diversified portfolio of 104 stocks and charges 59 basis points as fees.
Cambria Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF (BATS:FYLD) on the other hand also works on the same proposition as SYLD, but focuses on stocks from foreign developed countries. The fund manages an asset base of $62.4 million and includes companies with the best combination of dividend payments and net stock buybacks. The fund charges the same fee as SYLD.
Thus, FCFI and FCFD, if launched, have a fair chance of building assets for themselves, given the lack of competition in the space.About this article:ExpandTagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy, ETF AnalysisWant to share your opinion on this article?

GLOBAL EQUITY FLOAT
TrimTabs collects daily company-level data on corporate actions and insider trading in select non-U.S. equity markets, including Hong Kong and Japan.
Disclosure of stock buybacks in some non-U.S. stock markets is more stringent than in the U.S. stock market, allowing us to track actual stock buybacks in real time. For example, we track announced and completed buybacks in Japan on a daily basis.

SIX MODEL TRADING PORTFOLIOS
TrimTabs does more than compile data and offer analysis. It uses the data it collects to create alpha-generating model trading portfolios.
TrimTabs offers six model trading portfolios with varying levels of risk:
TrimTabs Demand Index Model Portfolio. This model portfolio for intermediate-term market timing is based on the TrimTabs Demand Index, which is constructed using fund flow and sentiment variables. It is either 100% short the S&P 500, 100% in cash, 100% long the S&P 500, or 200% long the S&P 500, and it changes as often as daily.
Since this model portfolio's inception in September 2008, it has increased 878%, versus a 99% gain for SPY (SPDR S&P 500) in the same period.

TrimTabs Investment Research is an institutional research firm focused on equity market liquidity. The firm was founded by Charles Biderman in 1990.
The key premise of our approach is that stock prices are a function of liquidity—the amount of shares available to buy and the amount of money available to buy them—rather than fundamental value. Like the prices of any tradable good, the prices of stocks are driven by supply and demand.
On March 2, 2017, TrimTabs Investment Research was acquired by Informa, a world leading provider of fund management, wealth management, investment banking and retail banking market intelligence and competitive research.

Why Invest in TTFS

For Core Diversification - Allocating to a buyback focused US Core strategy can further diversify your manager risk and potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. TTFS can provide an  alternative core allocation that may replace or complement market cap, fundamental, dividend or other index weighting methodologies you employ in your portfolio allocation.
To Achieve a Differentiated Approach to Harnessing Buyback Alpha - The Portfolio Manager’s approach to security selection and portfolio construction is unique relative to other buyback focused strategies, with the goal of delivering a differentiated portfolio and a lower correlation of excess returns (alpha) relative to its peers.
For a Potentially Higher Quality Equity Exposure - Companies that are able to buy back stock are generally on financially firmer footing than companies that do not have buyback programs in place.


Where can TTFS Fit in a Traditional Portfolio?

TTFS can provide an alternative core allocation that may replace or complement market cap,  fundamental, dividend or other index weighting methodologies you employ in your portfolio allocation.


5 Key Attributes

Supply/Demand Philosophy - The Portfolio Manager believes that the prices of stocks are influenced by supply and demand, and that stocks should perform best when their outstanding shares decrease. All else being equal, if the same amount of money is chasing a smaller number of shares, then the share price increases.
Quality Filtering - The Portfolio Manager invests in companies that are not increasing leverage and have positive free cash flow.
Buyback Strength-Based Weighting - Positions are sized based on Wilshire’s proprietary buyback strength signal, which is calculated based on a normalized measure of the reduction in
shares outstanding relative to other securities in the portfolio.
Extensive Stock Screening - The Portfolio Manager screens approximately 3,000
companies, narrows that universe to approximately 750 of the most liquid securities, and invests in approximately 100 stocks that have a reduction in outstanding shares, are not increasing leverage, and have positive free cash flow.
Innovative Research - Wilshire Associates has a history of innovation since its inception in 1972. The firm’s research team regularly reevaluates quantitative factors to continue to enhance
its investment solutions to adapt to evolving financial markets.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.  Investing in mid and small capitalization companies may be riskier and more volatile than large cap companies. Other Fund risks include market risk, equity risk, large cap risk, liquidity risk and trading risk. Please see prospectus for details regarding risk.
Alpha is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating," is calculated for managed products with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars, and the bottom 10% receive one star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three- and five-year Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns.

TrimTabs ETF Trust has recently filed a post-effective amendment for two ETFs – one focusing on the domestic market and the other on international markets. The funds – TrimTabs International Free-Cash-Flow ETF and TrimTabs U.S. Free-Cash-Flow ETF – are expected to trade under the tickers FCFI and FCFD following their launch.
Below, we have highlighted some of the details about the ETFs for investors seeking to know more about these in-registration funds:FCFI in Focus
As per the SEC filing, the proposed passively managed ETF looks to provide exposure to international companies poised for rapid growth by tracking the performance of the TrimTabs Intl Free-Cash-Flow Index before fees and expenses. For this purpose, the index focuses on companies with high free cash flow yield, including REITs. 
Free cash flow here refers to the total cash generated by the company after spending the money required to maintain or expand its operations, while free cash flow yield is the ratio of a company’s free cash flow to its market capitalization (read: REIT ETFs for Income and Diversification).
The index follows an equal weighted strategy which ensures a well-diversified portfolio. Moreover, the index seeks to provide exposure to 10 countries including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and U.K.
The fund will charge 69 basis points as fees.FCFD in Focus
The proposed fund looks to track the performance of the TrimTabs U.S. Free-Cash-Flow Index, before fees and expenses. The passively managed fund focuses solely on U.S. companies, including REITs having a high free cash flow yield.
FCFD in short follows the same strategy as FCFI and also charges the same fees, but with a domestic focus (read: Dividend Boom and Share Buybacks Put These ETFs in Focus).How Might it Fit in a Portfolio?
Free cash flow is one of the important tools to measure the performance of a company.  Usually most investors focus on fundamental indicators such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), book value, price-to-book (P/B) and the PEG ratio to select companies with strong fundamentals. They often ignore free cash flow measures.
However, the free cash flow yield offers a better representation of the company's performance and in most cases give a fairer picture of the company than other fundamental measures.
FCFI and FCFD, which focus on companies with high cash flow yield, are expected to hold some of the best performing international and domestic companies, respectively.ETF Competition
Presently there aren’t many funds focusing on this space. However, we have two funds from Cambria – one focused on the domestic space and the other on the international front –providing exposure to companies that generate high free cash flow and in turn look to return these to shareholders in the form of cash dividends, share repurchases, or by reducing their leverage.Cambria Shareholder Yield ETF (SYLD  -  Free Report)	 with an asset base of $218 million is based on the research that free cash flow is a key predictor of a company’s strength. This product invests in companies that show strong characteristics in returning free cash flow to their shareholders by way of cash dividends, share repurchases, or by reducing their leverage (read: Cambria Debuts U.S. ETF with Zero Management Fee).
The actively managed fund has a diversified portfolio of 104 stocks and charges 59 basis points as fees.Cambria Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF (FYLD) on the other hand also works on the same proposition as SYLD, but focuses on stocks from foreign developed countries. The fund manages an asset base of $62.4 million and includes companies with the best combination of dividend payments and net stock buybacks. The fund charges the same fee as SYLD (see all Broad Developed World ETFs here).
Thus, FCFI and FCFD, if launched, have a fair chance of building assets for themselves, given the lack of competition in the space.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
