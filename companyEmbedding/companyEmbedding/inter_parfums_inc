Inter Parfums, Inc. Reports 28.3% Increase In 2017 First Quarter Sales






Business Wire




Apr 27, 2017 4:05 PM EDT













 


















































  Inter Parfums, Inc. (NASDAQ GS:IPAR) today reported that for the three months ended March 31, 2017, net sales increased 28.3% to $143.1 million from $111.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. At comparable foreign currency exchange rates, consolidated first quarter net sales increased 30.6% as compared to the prior year period. Inter Parfums plans to issue results for the 2017 first quarter on or about May 9, 2017.            Net Sales:                          Three months ended March 31,     (in millions)         2017           2016           % Change                   European based product sales         $119.7       $92.1       29.9%     United States based product sales         23.4       19.4       20.4%             $143.1       $111.5       28.3%                                Discussing European based operations Jean Madar, Chairman & CEO of Inter Parfums stated, "The 57% increase in Jimmy Choo fragrance sales was a driving force behind the nearly 30% increase in net sales by European based operations. It is especially gratifying that the growth in Jimmy Choo brand sales was attributable to women's and men's legacy scents dating back from 2011 and 2014, respectively, as well as to the recent launch of spin-off lines, Jimmy Choo L'Eau for women and Jimmy Choo Man Ice. Lanvin made a major comeback in the current first quarter as brand sales rose 46% thanks to Lanvin's star performer, Éclat d'Arpège coupled with the international launch of Modern Princess. Rochas fragrance sales increased 43% based on the strength of the brand's historic lines plus initial sales of Mademoiselle Rochas, the first new product initiative since the brand was acquired in 2015. Coach fragrances contributed about $8 million to first quarter sales with the continued rollout of the brand's signature scent for women which debuted in mid-2016. Montblanc brand sales declined 10% in the current first quarter because of a difficult comparison as there was a 29% increase in 2016 first quarter sales when the highly successful scent, Montblanc Legend Spirit was launched."  Discussing U.S. based operations, Mr. Madar noted, "We are very pleased with the performance of Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister fragrances. They have been growth catalysts for our U.S. based operations since the launch of their respective brands' new products in mid-2016 and are chiefly responsible for the greater than 20% increase in sales. Another reason for the top line growth was an upturn in Anna Sui brand sales as economic conditions in China, a strong market for the brand, have been improving."

Inter Parfums, Inc. Reports 2017 First Quarter Results






Business Wire




May 9, 2017 4:14 PM EDT













 


















































  Inter Parfums, Inc. (NASDAQ GS: IPAR) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016:   Net sales were $143.1 million, up 28.3% from $111.5 million; at comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 30.6%;   Sales by European based operations rose 29.9% to $119.7 million from $92.1 million;   Sales by U.S. based operations increased 20.4% to $23.4 million compared to $19.4 million;   Gross margin was 63.0% of net sales compared to 63.9%;   S,G&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 44.7% compared to 48.3%   Operating income was $26.2 million, up 49.3% compared to $17.5 million;   Operating margin was 18.3% compared to 15.7%; and,   Net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. was $13.4 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $7.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share.    Discussing the Company's European based operations, Jean Madar, Chairman & CEO of Inter Parfums, Inc., stated, "While new fragrance launches are critical to our growth strategy, when it comes to return on investment, there is nothing more satisfying than recurring sales and profits generated by our best performing legacy scents. We experienced both in the first quarter of 2017. As we reported, there was a 57% increase in Jimmy Choo brand sales with both legacy fragrances and new scents driving growth. Our Jimmy Choo signature scent for women, which debuted in 2011, and Jimmy Choo Man which launched in 2014, have enjoyed remarkable staying power. Building on these very strong fragrance family trees, we successfully launched Jimmy Choo L'Eau for women and Jimmy Choo Man Ice during the current first quarter. Lanvin brand sales rebounded, increasing 46%, which was also attributable to both legacy and new scents, with Lanvin's star performer, Éclat d'Arpège, resuming a growth trend, coupled with the international launch of Modern Princess. Rochas fragrance sales increased 43% likewise based on the strength of the brand's historic lines plus initial sales of Mademoiselle Rochas, our first new product initiative since we acquired the brand in 2015."  He continued, "Coach fragrances contributed about $8.0 million to first quarter sales with the continued geographic rollout of the brand's signature scent for women which debuted in mid-2016. We have high expectations for our first Coach scent for men which will unveil in the fall. Montblanc brand sales declined 10% in the current first quarter because of a difficult comparison with the same period one year earlier when there was a 29% increase in sales owing in great part to the highly successful launch and rollout of Montblanc Legend Spirit. With the introduction of Montblanc Legend Night planned for the end of the year, we would anticipate an upswing in brand sales. We have several other fragrances in debuting this year, including a multi-scent collection for Boucheron, fragrance duo for Karl Lagerfeld, brand extension for Lanvin's Éclat d'Arpège, and new addition to  the Van Cleef & Arpels  Collection Extraordinaire assortment."  Discussing U.S. based operations, Mr. Madar noted, "Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister fragrances drove the growth in sales starting with the launch of Abercrombie & Fitch First Instinct for men and Hollister Wave for men and women in mid-2016. This year, these fragrance families are being enlarged with First Instinct for women and the Wave 2 duo. Another reason for the more than 20% top line growth was a turnaround in Anna Sui brand sales. During the economic downturn in China, a major market for the brand, we maintained our strong advertising and marketing commitment to Anna Sui, which is being rewarded as the Chinese economy improves. In addition, the brand's growing popularity in other Asian countries is contributing to the upturn in Anna Sui fragrance sales, which we are exploiting with a major new product launch for the brand later this year with distribution concentrated across Asia. We expect Dunhill brand sales to improve with the launch of Icon Racing late in the year, building upon the established success of the Icon fragrance family."  Russell Greenberg, Executive Vice President and CFO of Inter Parfums, Inc., stated, "Our blended gross profit margin declined slightly within our European based operations primarily due to product mix and increased costs relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions which aggregated $9.4 million and $6.8 million for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and represented 7.8% and 7.4% of net sales, respectively. Additionally, we sold the remaining $1.4 million of Balmain inventory at cost, which pressured first quarter gross profit margin. For U.S. operations, gross profit margin rose to 50.1% from last year's 48.2%, due to increased sales of higher margin prestige product under license."

Reports 28.3% Increase in 2017 First Quarter SalesBusiness WireApril 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Inter Parfums, Inc. (NASDAQ GS:IPAR) today reported that for the three months ended March 31, 2017, net sales increased 28.3% to $143.1 million from $111.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. At comparable foreign currency exchange rates, consolidated first quarter net sales increased 30.6% as compared to the prior year period. Inter Parfums plans to issue results for the 2017 first quarter on or about May 9, 2017.         Net Sales:                           Three months endedMarch 31,      (in millions)         2017           2016           % Change                   European based product sales         $119.7       $92.1       29.9%     United States based product sales         23.4       19.4       20.4%             $143.1       $111.5       28.3%                            Discussing European based operations Jean Madar, Chairman & CEO of Inter Parfums stated, “The 57% increase in Jimmy Choo fragrance sales was a driving force behind the nearly 30% increase in net sales by European based operations. It is especially gratifying that the growth in Jimmy Choo brand sales was attributable to women’s and men’s legacy scents dating back from 2011 and 2014, respectively, as well as to the recent launch of spin-off lines, Jimmy Choo L’Eau for women and Jimmy Choo Man Ice. Lanvin made a major comeback in the current first quarter as brand sales rose 46% thanks to Lanvin’s star performer, Éclat d’Arpège coupled with the international launch of Modern Princess. Rochas fragrance sales increased 43% based on the strength of the brand's historic lines plus initial sales of Mademoiselle Rochas, the first new product initiative since the brand was acquired in 2015. Coach fragrances contributed about $8 million to first quarter sales with the continued rollout of the brand’s signature scent for women which debuted in mid-2016. Montblanc brand sales declined 10% in the current first quarter because of a difficult comparison as there was a 29% increase in 2016 first quarter sales when the highly successful scent, Montblanc Legend Spirit was launched.”Discussing U.S. based operations, Mr. Madar noted, “We are very pleased with the performance of Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister fragrances. They have been growth catalysts for our U.S. based operations since the launch of their respective brands’ new products in mid-2016 and are chiefly responsible for the greater than 20% increase in sales. Another reason for the top line growth was an upturn in Anna Sui brand sales as economic conditions in China, a strong market for the brand, have been improving.”2017 GuidanceRussell Greenberg, Executive Vice President and CFO of Inter Parfums, Inc. stated, “First quarter sales were exceptionally strong due in part to the timing of several major launches. However, we don’t expect year-over-year growth of this kind in the remaining quarters of the year and we therefore remain cautious and affirm our 2017 guidance. As previously reported, we are looking for net sales in the range of $550 million to $560 million and net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. in the range of $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share. Guidance assumes the dollar remains at current levels.”Founded more than 30 years ago, Inter Parfums, Inc. is a premier fragrance company with a diverse portfolio of prestige brands that includes Abercrombie & Fitch, Agent Provocateur, Anna Sui, bebe, Boucheron, Coach, Dunhill, Hollister, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Montblanc, Oscar de la Renta, Paul Smith, Repetto, Rochas, Shanghai Tang, S.T. Dupont and Van Cleef & Arpels. The fragrance products developed, produced and distributed by Inter Parfums are sold in more than 100 countries throughout the world.Statements in this release which are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
