Risk ConsiderationsBuild America Bonds Risk. Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue meeting the requirements imposed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, it may not receive federal cash subsidy payments which could impair the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.Insurance Risks. Certain of the securities in the trust are covered by insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds from insurance companies. There can be no assurance that any insurer will be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the future.Municipal Bonds Risk. Municipal bonds are subject to numerous risks, including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the municipal bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal.Volatility Risk. The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trust's estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit.  Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust.  Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust.  Returns and prices will fluctuate.  Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.Some of the information may have been obtained from third parties, including ratings from credit ratings agencies such as Standard

Dow industrials just 170 points shy of 22,000 milestone
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged wrapped up at an all-time closing high Friday, ending the week u 1.2% higher, even as the broader market was weighed by a recent slump in shares of technology companies. But notably, the Dow finds itself just 170 points away from hitting another psychological milestone: 22,000. The Dow last hit 21,000 on March 1, but has advanced in fits and starts over the past five months amid growing doubts about how quickly President Donald Trump can implement pro-growth policies pledged during his campaign for the White House. A late-Friday defeat in passing a bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act, underlines those fears. Still, the blue-chip gauge has enjoyed a relatively steady climb, powered by strong moves in shares of Boeing Co. , which has been a key driver of the price-weighted average in recent weeks and months. Boeing shares have climbed 55% so far this year, making it the best performer in the benchmark. The Dow closed on Friday up 0.2% at a record 21,830, the S&P 500 index , meanwhile, ended down 0.1% at 2,472, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 0.1% at 6,374.
