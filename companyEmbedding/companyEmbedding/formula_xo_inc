Formula XO

































































Our VisionHealthy Beauty that is Sustainable



Formula XO, Inc. is a Healthy Beauty solution company established to bring the benefits of Dr. Michael Zasloff’s pioneering dermal biome research to everyone to improve everyday health and well-being.Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Sterling, Virginia, we develop, manufacture and distribute the illumai Biome Care System for the hair– the only hair system on the market made to protect, nurture and maintain the biome of the hair, skin & scalp.The Need

 If it’s not healthy, it’s not real beauty. Standard beauty practices destroy the dermal biome and are scientifically linked to the most common hair symptoms: dehydration and moisture loss, breakage and split ends, frizziness, color fade, dullness and itchy & flakey scalp. 


Meanwhile, more and more people want healthier, natural and sulfate-free products - the growth forecast for the global natural personal care sector is at a CAGR of 9.64% through 2019.


What they don’t want: to compromise on the beauty experience or results. Most lathering sulfate-free products use organosulfates with the same damaging results and non-lathering shampoos don’t effectively clean.

Our SolutionA healthy biome delivers Healthy Beauty. We champion the biome with illumai -- the first beauty line made specifically to support this remarkable ecosystem.Based upon 25 years of research, illumai uses patented formulas that preserve the essential proteins, peptides and oils natural to the hair and scalp. We generate hair that is stronger, shinier, moisturized and protected, and empower sustainable healthy beauty for any hair type.










OUR SCIENCEPatented and Globally Recognized






The illumai
Biome Care Difference
Our solution is the only available shampoo or cleansing conditioner that does not disrupt the self- healing system supporting scalp and hair health, and works with the Biome.
The patented advances, XO-70, Lipid Complex and Isoleucine, each ensure proper water barriers and moisture levels of both hair and skin, and it protects us from irritation, infection, fungi, hair breakage, dandruff and other problems.



A combination of Lauryl Methylglucamide (coconut oil/plant starch) and Decyl Glucoside (corn germ oil/plant starch), ingredients derived from natural resources. These mild lathering surfactants remove excess oil, sweat and product build-up, but leave the biome intact. XO-70® is not anionically charged – it won’t cause static or leave a dulling film. It also doesn’t lift the cuticle - so it won’t cause structural weakness and can’t remove color from the hair shaft.


An essential amino acid that triggers the biome to produce antimicrobial peptides and provides a source of strengthening protein. With other naturally-derived ingredients, this patented formula is attracted to the most damaged areas, then rinses clean with no residue.


A patented mix of lipids from natural vegetable sources that, when shaken, draw together, target existing structural weaknesses, detangle and provide a protective shield.


Our patented formulas work together in this 3-step system to restore and protect the biome at it's essence, leaving hair soft, shiny, manageable and full of Healthy Beauty.

Product

The illumai Essential System is a three-step hair cleansing system that delivers truly remarkable results owing to a patented, revolutionary new approach invented by Michael Zasloff, MD, PhD (former head of genetics research at NIH and dean of research at Georgetown Medical School) and refined by Mario Russo (a multi-year winner of Elle's "Top 100" list of hair stylists).The… · More illumai system is the first and only "biome care system" for the hair.  The biome is the the living ecosystem of scalp, follicles, hair, glands, peptides, proteins, moisturizing oils, and related microbiota that keep your scalp and hair heathy and well-functioning.  Conventional shampoos and conditioners damage the biome by stripping the protective lipids from your head and replacing them with man-made silicones and other lubricants.  The illumai Essential System does not do this ... and the results are not only much healthier, but hair is shiny, soft, manageable, stronger and more natural.

They work together to keep your hair and scalp healthy and protected. Get manageable, shiny, frizz-free hair that’s full of healthy beauty, instead of damaged hair with artificial coatings. Join the fans of healthy beauty and reveal your true brilliance.
