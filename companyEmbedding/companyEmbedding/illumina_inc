About Us




We are beginning to unlock the power of the genome – to transform healthcare and beyond








About Illumina







Driving innovation
As a startup, Illumina aspired to transform human health. Our initial products enabled researchers to explore DNA at an entirely new scale, helping them create the first map of gene variations associated with health, disease, and drug response. Every breakthrough opened up a new world, and showed us how much further there is to go.


 



Finding answers
While the rate of progress is accelerating exponentially, we are only beginning to understand the clinical significance of the genome. What causes a cancer cell to mutate? What is the origin of a puzzling disease? Is it possible to prevent the next outbreak? Or safeguard the world’s food supply? These are just a few of the challenges that inspire us to push the boundaries of our imagination.





Making a difference now
Today we are a global leader in genomics – an industry at the intersection of biology and technology. At the most fundamental level, we enable our customers to read and understand genetic variations. We strive to make our solutions increasingly simple, more accessible, and always reliable. As a result, discoveries that were unimaginable even a few years ago are now becoming routine – and are making their way into patient treatment.

Empowering a healthy future
We now have the ability to sequence at an unprecedented scale. Collectively, this will give us a much deeper understanding of genetics than ever before. We will begin to truly unlock the power of the genome. These advances will trigger a fundamental shift in healthcare and beyond. Medicine will continue to become more preventive and more precise. We will be healthier, longer. We have only just begun.

History[edit]




Czarnik, Stuelpnagel and Chee at their Illumina office in the Summer of 1998.


Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.
Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.
On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Solexa, Inc. Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.[2] Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli [3] and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.
In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.[25] The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.[26]
Products[edit]
DNA methylation profiling[edit]
Golden Gate Methylation[edit]
The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel allows the user to probe 1,505 CpG loci selected from 807 genes across a large sample size. The array based method allows 96 samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix.
Infinium methylation[edit]
Utilizing Illumina's HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip and the Infinium technology, this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for 27,578 CpG sites across over 14,000 genes. This Chip has been replaced by the 450K Methylation Chip and later by the EPIC Array, covering about 850k sites.
DNA sequencing[edit]

History[edit]




Czarnik, Stuelpnagel and Chee at their Illumina office in the Summer of 1998.


Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.
Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.
On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Solexa, Inc. Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.[2] Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli [3] and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.
In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic.

In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.[25] The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.[26]
Products[edit]
DNA methylation profiling[edit]
Golden Gate Methylation[edit]
The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel allows the user to probe 1,505 CpG loci selected from 807 genes across a large sample size. The array based method allows 96 samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix.
Infinium methylation[edit]
Utilizing Illumina's HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip and the Infinium technology, this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for 27,578 CpG sites across over 14,000 genes. This Chip has been replaced by the 450K Methylation Chip and later by the EPIC Array, covering about 850k sites.
DNA sequencing[edit]
Main articles: Illumina (Solexa) sequencing and Illumina dye sequencing
Illumina sells a number of very high-throughput DNA sequencing systems, also known as DNA sequencers, based on technology developed by Solexa. The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination.[27][28] The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip, followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection. The current portfolio includes the following Sequencers:

					Full Description



Illumina, Inc. (Illumina), incorporated on May 16, 2000, is a provider of sequencing- and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. The Company operates through two segments: Core Illumina and the consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which include the activities of GRAIL, Inc. (GRAIL) and Helix Holdings I, LLC (Helix). Core Illumina consists of its core operations. Core Illumina's products and services serve customers in the research, clinical and applied markets, and enable the adoption of a range of genomic solutions. GRAIL is engaged in developing a blood test for early-stage cancer detection. Helix was established to enable individuals to explore their genetic information by providing sequencing and database services for consumers through third-party partners.The Company's portfolio of integrated systems, consumables and analysis tools addresses the range of genomic complexity, price points, and throughput, enabling customers to select the solution for their research or clinical challenge. The Company offers its products and services to various customers, including genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and hospitals, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, commercial molecular diagnostic laboratories, and consumer genomics companies. The Company's products and services enable the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings. The Company provides reproductive-health solutions, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis, and neonatal and genetic health testing. The Company's technology enables NIPT for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in maternal blood. Its preimplantation genetic screening solution is used with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to determine, before implantation, whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes. Its preimplantation genetic diagnosis technology determines which embryos are free from gene variants associated with genetic diseases.The Company provides whole-genome sequencing, genotyping, NIPT and support services. The Company's technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for population-scale studies, genome-wide discovery, target selection, and validation studies. Its products are used to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity, from whole-genome sequencing to targeted panels. Its products include instruments and consumables (which include reagents, flow cells and microarrays). The Company's sequencing platforms are used to perform whole-genome, de novo, exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes.The Company's DNA sequencing technology is based on its reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry, referred to as sequencing by synthesis (SBS) biochemistry. SBS tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the DNA chain is copied in a parallel fashion. Its sequencing platforms range between 500 megabases (Mb) and 2.0 terabases (Tb) of genomic data in a single run, depending on the instrument and application. Its BaseSpace Informatics Suite cloud platform supports its sequencing applications. The BaseSpace Suite integrates directly with its sequencing instruments, allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs, process and analyzes the raw genomic data. It facilitates data sharing, provides data-storage solutions and streamlines analysis through various applications from it and the bioinformatics community. The Company's BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a manufacturing process to produce arrays that performs multiple assays simultaneously. Its iScan array scanner system and NextSeq 550 system are used to image the arrays. The Company's array-based genotyping consumables are used for a range of analyses, including diverse species, disease-related mutations, and genetic characteristics associated with cancer.The Company competes with Agilent Technologies, Inc., BGI, Oxford Nanopore Technologies Limited, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., QIAGEN N.V., Roche Holding AG. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.

History[edit]




Czarnik, Stuelpnagel and Chee at their Illumina office in the Summer of 1998.


Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.
Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.
On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Solexa, Inc. Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.[2] Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli [3] and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.
In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.[25] The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.[26]
Products[edit]
DNA methylation profiling[edit]
Golden Gate Methylation[edit]
The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel allows the user to probe 1,505 CpG loci selected from 807 genes across a large sample size. The array based method allows 96 samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix.
Infinium methylation[edit]
Utilizing Illumina's HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip and the Infinium technology, this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for 27,578 CpG sites across over 14,000 genes. This Chip has been replaced by the 450K Methylation Chip and later by the EPIC Array, covering about 850k sites.
DNA sequencing[edit]
Main articles: Illumina (Solexa) sequencing and Illumina dye sequencing
Illumina sells a number of very high-throughput DNA sequencing systems, also known as DNA sequencers, based on technology developed by Solexa. The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination.[27][28] The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip, followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection. The current portfolio includes the following Sequencers:

History[edit]




Czarnik, Stuelpnagel and Chee at their Illumina office in the Summer of 1998.


Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.
Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.
On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Solexa, Inc. Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.[2] Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli [3] and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.
In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.[25] The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.[26]
Products[edit]
DNA methylation profiling[edit]
Golden Gate Methylation[edit]
The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel allows the user to probe 1,505 CpG loci selected from 807 genes across a large sample size. The array based method allows 96 samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix.
Infinium methylation[edit]
Utilizing Illumina's HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip and the Infinium technology, this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for 27,578 CpG sites across over 14,000 genes. This Chip has been replaced by the 450K Methylation Chip and later by the EPIC Array, covering about 850k sites.
DNA sequencing[edit]
Main articles: Illumina (Solexa) sequencing and Illumina dye sequencing
Illumina sells a number of very high-throughput DNA sequencing systems, also known as DNA sequencers, based on technology developed by Solexa. The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination.[27][28] The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip, followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection. The current portfolio includes the following Sequencers:

History[edit]




Czarnik, Stuelpnagel and Chee at their Illumina office in the Summer of 1998.


Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.
Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.
On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Solexa, Inc. Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.[2] Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli [3] and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.
In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,[4] and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.[5] This is still too expensive for true commercialization but the price will most likely decrease substantially over the next few years as they realize economies of scale and given the competition with other companies such as Complete Genomics and Knome.[6][7] As of May 2011[update], Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.[8][9]
Up until 2010 Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled "for research use only"; in early 2010 Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.[10][11] This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.[12]
Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.[13] On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.[14][15] Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).[16] Illumina rejected the offer,[1][17] and Roche abandoned the offer in April.[18] As of April 2013[update], the company's chief executive officer was Jay Flatley.[1]
In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome. The company claimed that forty such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.[19] In January 2014, Illumina already held 70 percent of the market for genome-sequencing machines.[20] Illumina machines accounted for more than 90 percent of all DNA data produced.[21]
On July 5, 2016 Jay Flatley assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.[22][23]
In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company Grail, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. The company has plans in 2017 to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and has received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in Series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.[24] The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.[25] The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.[26]
Products[edit]
DNA methylation profiling[edit]
Golden Gate Methylation[edit]
The GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel allows the user to probe 1,505 CpG loci selected from 807 genes across a large sample size. The array based method allows 96 samples to be probed simultaneously on one array matrix.
Infinium methylation[edit]
Utilizing Illumina's HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip and the Infinium technology, this method allows the user to map single methylation resolution for 27,578 CpG sites across over 14,000 genes. This Chip has been replaced by the 450K Methylation Chip and later by the EPIC Array, covering about 850k sites.
DNA sequencing[edit]
Main articles: Illumina (Solexa) sequencing and Illumina dye sequencing
Illumina sells a number of very high-throughput DNA sequencing systems, also known as DNA sequencers, based on technology developed by Solexa. The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination.[27][28] The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip, followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection. The current portfolio includes the following Sequencers:

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
