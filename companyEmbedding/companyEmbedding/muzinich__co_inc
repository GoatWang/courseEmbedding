Investment Philosophy
The Muzinich Story





 



Investment Philosophy and Process


Philosophy 
We view buying a bond as lending money to a company. We look for bonds for which the market is mispricing risk based on our rigorous bottom-up credit research. We constantly assess relative value and dynamically adjust portfolios as risk-return profiles change. Our goal is to compound attractive interest streams while avoiding defaults and credit impairments

This approach may sound simple, but in our experience, is not commonly adopted. Many investors do not view buying a bond as lending money to a company, but see it as buying a security for a short period of time in order to benefit from hoped for market appreciation. We call this “speculative lending.”
 
Process
Our process is designed around our value lending philosophy and is based on 5 principles:

Build a deep understanding of the business model of the companies we lend to: evaluate products, competitors, suppliers, and customers.
Conduct proprietary quantitative analysis and stress test our investment assumptions for difficult environments.
Carefully review credit contracts and covenants.
Evaluate company management.
Construct highly liquid portfolios using best ideas to achieve the appropriate risk-return characteristics at a portfolio level.





The Funds are offered to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Please refer to the Credit Opportunities Fund prospectus, the U.S. High Yield Corp Bond Fund prospectus and Low Duration Fund prospectus for important information about the investment company including objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Read each of the Fund documents carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-855-689-4642.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in the fund include risks associated with debt securities, lower-rated and non-rated securities, foreign securities including emerging markets, derivatives, floating rate loans, turnover risk, leverage, securities with liquidity risk and investments in other funds or ETFs. Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about the risks of investing in the fund.

Muzinich & Co., Inc. Requests that TICC Board Postpone Special Meeting of Stockholders and Engage Independent Advisors to Run Comprehensive Evaluation

Sep 25, 2015, 11:52 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Muzinich & Co., Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Muzinich & Co., Inc., a top 5 stockholder of TICC Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:   TICC), announced today that it has delivered a letter to the Board of TICC, requesting that the board immediately postpone the Special Meeting of Stockholders currently scheduled for October 27, 2015 and that a reputable investment bank be engaged to undertake a comprehensive review of existing competing offers, solicit additional offers, and recommend action that is in the best interests of stockholders.
The full text of the letter follows:
Board of Directors 
TICC Capital Corp.
Dear Sirs,
We write with reference to recent events concerning TICC Capital Corp. ("TICC").  We wish to notify you that Muzinich & Co., Inc. ("we" or "Muzinich"), an institutional investment manager acting on behalf of its clients, holds a material position in TICC.  As of June 30, 2015, we were among the top 5 stockholders of TICC and have been a stockholder for over one year.
Muzinich strongly believes that TICC's Board of Directors must establish a comprehensive process to identify and independently evaluate existing competing offers, solicit additional offers, and recommend action that is in the best interests of stockholders.  In discussions with your management, we mentioned that perhaps the Board of Directors should postpone the Special Meeting of Stockholders of TICC scheduled for October 27, 2015 and hire an investment banking firm to review existing offers as well as solicit additional offers. This course of action, we believe, would assure that the best interests of stockholders are being served.  
We were surprised when the Special Committee released a statement on September 21, 2015 reaffirming its initial position and, we believe, premature decision to pursue the Benefit Street Partners' ("Benefit Street") offer over competing offers.  We believe, based on public disclosure, this decision was made without the benefit of appropriate advice and necessary deliberation, especially as the Benefit Street offer does not expire.
We were further disappointed by the letter from the Special Committee to stockholders of September 24, 2015, again rejecting a competing offer without due consideration or process.
We would like to note that the Board of Directors has continued to extend the management contract of the current investment manager of TICC (TICC Management LLC), who has pursued an investment strategy which has not proven to be in the best interests of stockholders.  As you know, TICC's share price has declined over 50% since its IPO and has declined during the past twelve months by approximately 25%.  This poor share price performance has directly resulted from the continued pursuit of the current "non market" investment strategy and will likely make any portfolio rebalancing by a new investment manager more complex.  Given this continued failure of process since the IPO, we would expect the Board of Directors to make every effort to ensure that any change of investment manager would be clearly in the best interests of stockholders and demonstrate good faith in this pursuit through a thorough, thoughtful, and comprehensive process.
Again, we are requesting that the Board of Directors of TICC immediately postpone the Special Meeting of Stockholders of TICC scheduled for October 27, 2015 and hire an investment banking firm to review, in good faith, all existing offers and, importantly, solicit additional offers to assure that the best interests of stockholders are being served. 
Sincerely yours,
 
Muzinich & Co., Inc.
