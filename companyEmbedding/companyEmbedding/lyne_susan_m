Description




							Nicholas Woodman


					
							Mr. Nicholas Woodman serves as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Woodman got his start in 1998 by founding an online gaming company, Funbug.com. When that venture failed in 2001, Mr. Woodman planned an international surfing trip to look for inspiration. While preparing for that trip, Mr. Woodman had the idea for a 35mm film-based wrist camera that could be worn during sports like surfing, enabling the user to capture images while engaged in the sport. This idea became GoPro’s first product, the HERO Camera. In the years that followed, Mr. Woodman, along with friends, family and employees, innovated on the HERO Camera concept along with a wide array of mounting devices that would make it easy to mount the camera to everything from helmets to surfboards, vehicles and more. Mr. Woodman holds a B.A. in Visual Arts from the University of California, San Diego. We believe Mr. Woodman’s experience as the founder of GoPro and his knowledge of our products and customers give him the experience and leadership capabilities that qualify him to serve as a member of our board of directors.

Early life[edit]
Susan Lynn was born on April 26 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3] She attended and graduated from Bishop Dunn Memorial School and Mount St. Mary's Academy. She graduated high school from Newburgh Free Academy (NFA) in Newburgh, NY. She completed her BS in economics at Tennessee State University.
Political career[edit]
When Republican Representative Mae Beavers vacated the 57th district House seat to run for Tennessee Senate, Lynn ran in the four-way August 1, 2002 Republican Primary, winning with 3,531 votes (50.2%)[4] and won the November 5, 2002 General election with 14,332 votes (62.9%) against Democratic nominee Danny Farmer.[5] In 2004, Lynn was challenged in the August 5, 2004 Republican Primary, winning with 3,228 votes (66.6%)[6] and won the November 2, 2004 General election with 28,019 votes.[7] In 2006, Lynn was unopposed for both the August 3, 2006 Republican Primary, winning with 6,169 votes,[8] and the November 7, 2006 General election, winning with 21,258 votes.[9] Lynn was unopposed for the August 7, 2008 Republican Primary, winning with 2,743 votes,[10] and won the November 4, 2008 General election with 26,894 votes (74.4%) against Democratic nominee Ken Wilkinson.[11] In 2010, Lynn became a candidate for state Senate for the 17th district in August 2009,[12] nearly two months after incumbent state Senator Mae Beavers announced her plans to vacate the seat in order to run for County Mayor of Wilson County, TN.[13] Ten months later, Beavers had a sudden change of heart, and in a surprise move re-entered the Senate race [14] creating a three-way Republican Primary for the August 5, 2010 election. Lynn lost to incumbent Beavers by a narrow 2 percentage points,[15] Beavers was re-elected in the November 2, 2010 General election against Democratic nominee George McDonald.[16] In 2012, Lynn ran again for the House district 57th seat in the August 2, 2012 Republican Primary; a seat then held by single term incumbent Linda Elam. Lynn regained the seat with 67% of the vote [17] To regain her former seat, Lynn challenged District 57 incumbent Representative Linda Elam in the August 2, 2012 Republican Primary, winning with 4,720 votes (67.6%)[18] and was unopposed for the November 6, 2012 General election, winning with 24,116 votes.[19] In 2014, Lynn was re-elected to the Tennessee House in District 57. The Democrat Challenger, Jesse McLevain, received 4,533 votes and Lynn received 14,919 votes.[20] Lynn was unopposed in the Primary Election.
With Bill Ketron, Lynn sponsored a "no-go zone" bill in February 2015.[21]
Lynn proposed an anti-transgender bathroom bill in 2016.[22] She called transgender identity a "mental disorder" (sic).[22][23]
In April 2016, Lynn distributed an islamophobic DVD to her colleagues in the legislature, some of whom "formally filed a workplace harassment complaint with [...] the state's head of legislative human resources."[24] The DVD, titled America's Mosques Exposed: Video Evidence They Are War Factories, was produced by Patriot Pastor Organization, whose executive director, Louie Johnston, is one of her constituents.[25]
Personal life[edit]
Lynn has a husband, Michael, and two children.[3] She is a Southern Baptist.[3]

Early life[edit]
Susan Lynn was born on April 26 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3] She attended and graduated from Bishop Dunn Memorial School and Mount St. Mary's Academy. She graduated high school from Newburgh Free Academy (NFA) in Newburgh, NY. She completed her BS in economics at Tennessee State University.
Political career[edit]
When Republican Representative Mae Beavers vacated the 57th district House seat to run for Tennessee Senate, Lynn ran in the four-way August 1, 2002 Republican Primary, winning with 3,531 votes (50.2%)[4] and won the November 5, 2002 General election with 14,332 votes (62.9%) against Democratic nominee Danny Farmer.[5] In 2004, Lynn was challenged in the August 5, 2004 Republican Primary, winning with 3,228 votes (66.6%)[6] and won the November 2, 2004 General election with 28,019 votes.[7] In 2006, Lynn was unopposed for both the August 3, 2006 Republican Primary, winning with 6,169 votes,[8] and the November 7, 2006 General election, winning with 21,258 votes.[9] Lynn was unopposed for the August 7, 2008 Republican Primary, winning with 2,743 votes,[10] and won the November 4, 2008 General election with 26,894 votes (74.4%) against Democratic nominee Ken Wilkinson.[11] In 2010, Lynn became a candidate for state Senate for the 17th district in August 2009,[12] nearly two months after incumbent state Senator Mae Beavers announced her plans to vacate the seat in order to run for County Mayor of Wilson County, TN.[13] Ten months later, Beavers had a sudden change of heart, and in a surprise move re-entered the Senate race [14] creating a three-way Republican Primary for the August 5, 2010 election. Lynn lost to incumbent Beavers by a narrow 2 percentage points,[15] Beavers was re-elected in the November 2, 2010 General election against Democratic nominee George McDonald.[16] In 2012, Lynn ran again for the House district 57th seat in the August 2, 2012 Republican Primary; a seat then held by single term incumbent Linda Elam. Lynn regained the seat with 67% of the vote [17] To regain her former seat, Lynn challenged District 57 incumbent Representative Linda Elam in the August 2, 2012 Republican Primary, winning with 4,720 votes (67.6%)[18] and was unopposed for the November 6, 2012 General election, winning with 24,116 votes.[19] In 2014, Lynn was re-elected to the Tennessee House in District 57. The Democrat Challenger, Jesse McLevain, received 4,533 votes and Lynn received 14,919 votes.[20] Lynn was unopposed in the Primary Election.
With Bill Ketron, Lynn sponsored a "no-go zone" bill in February 2015.[21]
Lynn proposed an anti-transgender bathroom bill in 2016.[22] She called transgender identity a "mental disorder" (sic).[22][23]
In April 2016, Lynn distributed an islamophobic DVD to her colleagues in the legislature, some of whom "formally filed a workplace harassment complaint with [...] the state's head of legislative human resources."[24] The DVD, titled America's Mosques Exposed: Video Evidence They Are War Factories, was produced by Patriot Pastor Organization, whose executive director, Louie Johnston, is one of her constituents.[25]
Personal life[edit]
Lynn has a husband, Michael, and two children.[3] She is a Southern Baptist.[3]
