Director ”). At the IPO Closing, the Silver Lake
Directors shall be Hollie Moore Haynes, John Brennan and Jason
Babcoke; the Iconiq Director shall be William Griffith; and the
Unaffiliated Independent Directors shall be Graham Smith and Thomas

classes of directors, each of whose members shall serve for
staggered three-year terms as follows:
 



 


(1)


the class I
directors shall include Therese Tucker and Mario
Spanicciati;



 



 


(2)


the class II
directors shall include Jason Babcoke, Hollie Moore Haynes and
Thomas Unterman; and



 



 


(3)

directors shall expire at the Company’s 2017 annual meeting
of stockholders at which directors are elected. The initial term of
the class II directors shall expire at the Company’s 2018
annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected. The
initial term of the class III directors shall expire at the

Independent Director will be nominated by Silver Lake and must be
reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors. If Silver Lake has
not nominated an individual to be a Sponsor Nominated Independent
Director prior to the 30 th day prior to the first (1
st ) anniversary of the IPO Date, the Board of
Directors may appoint an individual who qualifies as an Independent
Director and as an audit committee financial expert to comply with
the listing rules of the stock exchange on which the Company is
listed.

(c) The Stockholders shall have the
right to designate directors as follows:

meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
 
9

Measurement Date ”), in the aggregate 35% or less, but
more than 25% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, then
with respect to such meeting and thereafter, the maximum number of
Silver Lake Designees shall be reduced to no more than six
(6) Silver Lake Designees; (B) if Silver Lake
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, as of an Ownership
Measurement Date, in the aggregate 25% or less, but more than 20%

discretion, one (1) individual (an “ Iconiq
Designee ” and, together with the Silver Lake Designees,
the “ Sponsor Designees ”) to serve on the Board
of Directors; provided , however , that if Iconiq
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, as of an Ownership
Measurement Date, in the aggregate less than 5% of the issued and
outstanding Common Shares, then with respect to such meeting and
thereafter, Iconiq shall have no right to designate an Iconiq
Designee;

(iii) For so long as Tucker
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the issued
and outstanding Common Shares and subject to Section 3.01(g),
Tucker; provided , however , that if Tucker

Designation Notice by Silver Lake at any time, the size of the
Board of Directors will be increased to facilitate the election to
the Board of Directors of the Silver Lake Designees named by Silver
Lake in the Director Designation Notice, and such Silver Lake
Designees will be elected to the Board of Directors consistent with
Section 3.01(c). A “ Director Designation Notice
” shall mean a written notice delivered by Silver Lake to the
Board of Directors c/o the Secretary of the Company stating that
Silver Lake is designating an additional director in accordance
with its rights set forth in this Agreement and naming such
additional Silver Lake Designee.

(e) At each annual meeting, or
special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected, the Stockholders and the Board of Directors (and any
applicable committee thereof) shall take all Necessary Action to,
as applicable, (i) include any Sponsor Designee with the slate
of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors for the
applicable class of directors for election by the stockholders of
the Company, and solicit proxies or consents in favor thereof and
(ii) include Tucker and Spanicciati with the slate of nominees
recommended by the Board of Directors for the applicable class of
directors for election by the stockholders of the Company and
solicit proxies or consents in favor thereof, in each case, subject
to Section 3.01(c).

(f) To the extent not inconsistent
with Section 141(k) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware and the Company’s Organizational Documents,
(i) each Sponsor shall have the exclusive right to remove its
Sponsor Directors from the Board of Directors, and the Board of
Directors and each Stockholder shall take all Necessary Action to
cause the removal of any Sponsor Director at the request of such
designating Sponsor and (ii) such Sponsor shall have the
exclusive right to designate for election to the Board of Directors
individuals to fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal
or resignation of its Sponsor Directors, and the Board of Directors
and each Stockholder shall take all Necessary Action to cause any
such vacancies to be filled by replacement directors designated by
such Sponsor as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided
, that, for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this paragraph, such Sponsor shall not have the
right to designate a replacement director, and the Board of
Directors and each Stockholder shall not be required to take any
action to cause any vacancy to be filled with any such Sponsor
Designee, to the extent that election or appointment of such
Sponsor Designee to the Board of Directors would result in a number
of directors designated by such Sponsor in excess of the number of
directors that such Sponsor is then entitled to designate for
membership on the Board of Directors pursuant to
Section 3.01(c).

(g) To the extent not inconsistent
with Section 141(k) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware and the Company’s Organizational Documents,
in the event that Tucker or Spanicciati ceases to be employed by
the Company for any reason and she or he beneficially owns less
than 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, as applicable,
then (i) she or he will immediately tender her or his
resignation from the Board of Directors, effective only upon
acceptance by the Board of Directors (excluding both Tucker and
Spanicciati) and (ii) the Board of Directors may, in its sole
discretion, accept or reject such resignation. If the Board of
Directors rejects the resignation, Tucker or Spanicciati, as
applicable, will continue to have the right to be designated for
membership on the Board of Directors pursuant to
Section 3.01(c); provided , that if the Board of
Directors determines such resignation
 
11


would be in the best interests of the Company
any time after the cessation of employment by Tucker or Spanicciati
and regardless of the number of Common Shares held by Tucker or
Spanicciati, as applicable, by unanimous vote of the directors
excluding both Tucker and Spanicciati (i) the Board of Directors
may require the delivery of Tucker or Spanicciati’s immediate
resignation (and each of Tucker and Spanicciati, as applicable,
shall then deliver such resignation), as applicable, from the Board
of Directors and (ii) each Stockholder shall take all
Necessary Action to cause the removal of Tucker or Spanicciati, as
applicable, from the Board of Directors.

Stockholder at each annual or special meeting of the Company at
which directors of the Company are to be elected, in favor of, or
to take all actions by written consent in lieu of any such meeting
as are necessary, or other Necessary Action to cause the election
as members of the Board of Directors of those individuals described
in Section 3.01(c) in accordance with, and otherwise to
achieve the composition of the Board of Directors and effect the
intent of, the provisions of this Section 3.01.

(i) For so long as the Stockholders

subsidiaries or the initiation of any action relating to a
voluntary bankruptcy, reorganization or recapitalization with
respect to the Company or any of its material
subsidiaries;

(iii) the disposition, in one
or more related transactions, of assets with a value in excess of
$50,000,000 or the entering into of a joint venture requiring a
capital contribution in excess of $50,000,000 by either the Company

(iv) any fundamental change in

their respective assets in connection with, indebtedness or
derivatives liability, or any related series of indebtedness or
derivative liabilities, in excess of $150,000,000 or amending in
any material respect the terms of existing or future indebtedness
or derivatives liability such that the aggregate liability is in
excess of $150,000,000;

require approval by a majority of the independent members of the
Board of Directors, but only to the extent permitted by applicable
laws, regulations and stock exchange listing rules and regulations,
in which case any such determinations and approvals shall be made
by the Compensation Committee.

(k) For so long as Silver Lake
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate more
than 15% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, Silver Lake
shall have the right to have (i) one of its Silver Lake
Directors appointed (at Silver Lake’s election) as its
representative to serve on the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors, but only to the extent permitted by applicable laws,
regulations and stock exchange listing rules and regulations, and

Directors, and Silver Lake has not taken action within five
(5) Business Days of receipt of such notice to appoint Silver

listing rules, the Board of Directors may increase the size of the
Board of Directors, by vote of a majority of the members of the

exchange listing rules.
