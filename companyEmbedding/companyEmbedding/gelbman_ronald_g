LLCPresentationOperatorCompare to:Previous Statements by HAE» Haemonetics (HAE) Ron Gelbman on Q3 2016 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2016 Haemonetics Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call will be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Gerry Gould, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Gerry Gould - Vice President-Investor RelationsThank you, Katherine. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Haemonetics' fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call and webcast. I'm joined today by Ron Gelbman, Interim CEO; Kent Davies, Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Lindop, CFO.Please note that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results. Additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially is available in the Form 8-K we filed today as well as in our recent 10-K and 10-Q filings.This morning, we posted our earnings release to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, we posted comments on fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2016 results. These comments cover much of what we'll discuss on this morning's call. In future quarters, we plan to post the commentary to our website enabling us to abbreviate our prepared remarks on the quarterly call and to proceed more directly to your questions.On today's call, Ron will discuss highlights of our business performance and Kent will provide more detail on the important trends in our commercial operations in the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Chris will cover key elements of the financial performance of the business. After some brief closing comments, we'll take your questions.Before I turn the call over to Ron, I would like to mention the treatment in our adjusted results of certain items which, by their nature and size, affect the comparability of our financial results. Consistent with our past practice, we have excluded certain costs and charges from the adjusted financial results which we'll talk about today.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we excluded certain non-cash charges and reserves related to the recent strategic review of our business franchises. In fiscal 2016, we excluded certain intangible and other asset write-downs, the reversal of related contingent consideration and other non-cash charges and reserves, but in the fourth quarter and fiscal years 2015 and 2016, we excluded pre-tax transformation and restructuring costs and related tax effects.The earnings information discussed for all periods also excludes deal-related amortization expense. Further details of fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 excluded amounts, including comparisons with applicable periods of fiscal 2015 are provided in our Form 8-K and have been posted to our Investor Relations website. Our press release and website also include a complete P&L, balance sheet, and a summary statement of cash flows as well as reconciliation of our GAAP and adjusted results.Finally, as we pointed out in our earning release, please note that the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2016 have an extra week compared with fiscal 2015.With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron.Ronald G. Gelbman - Interim Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Gerry, and good morning to all of you. As we noted last quarter, we have two attractive growth franchises, Plasma and Hemostasis Management, or TEG family of products. These two growth franchises have delivered strong constant currency growth consistently over the past several years and this trend continued in fiscal 2016.We finished fiscal 2016 with revenue of $910 million, flat with the prior fiscal year, and up 3% in constant currency. This was in line with the guidance range we had provided, albeit at the lower end.In the fourth quarter, total company revenue grew 10% on a constant currency basis with about two-thirds of that growth attributable to an extra week in the fiscal year which landed in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis with about half of that growth attributable to that extra week. Strong performances in the Plasma and Hemostasis Management franchises continued, but unfortunately, so did declines in the Donor business.Our North America franchise, Plasma franchise, delivered 25% growth in the fourth quarter completing a fiscal year with 17% growth, including 6% from liquid solutions and 2% from the 53rd week. We are focused on working with our customers on optimizing collection productivity and yield, while benefiting from continued growth in the end market for plasma-derived pharmaceutical.Our NextGen plasma collection software is commercially available in the U.S. market and continues to gain customer interest. We now have four contracts signed including one with our largest customer. Our new collection device is targeted for commercial introduction in fiscal 2018. This combination will deliver differentiated value to each plasma collection event.Our Hemostasis Management, or TEG franchise, is well-positioned and on a healthy growth trajectory. TEG disposables grew 22% in constant currency this quarter, closing out the year in which 21% growth was achieved. Our legacy TEG 5000 device is driving this growth and we are drawing closer to the full global launch of our new TEG 6s device. We expect our TEG family of products, TEG 5000, TEG 6s and TEG Manager, to continue to deliver growth with existing and new customers as we penetrate the global market. Much more will follow on our Plasma and Hemostasis Management franchises as well as other aspects of our portfolio at our Investor Day in Boston next week.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
