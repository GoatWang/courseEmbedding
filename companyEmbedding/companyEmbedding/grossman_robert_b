About this Textbook




Intended for students of intermediate organic chemistry, this text shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. The discussion is organized by types of mechanisms and the conditions under which the reaction is executed, rather than by the overall reaction as is the case in most textbooks. The treatment emphasizes unifying principles, showing how common mechanisms link seemingly disparate reactions. 
Each chapter discusses common mechanistic pathways and suggests practical tips for drawing them. Worked problems are included in the discussion of each mechanism, and “common error alerts” are scattered throughout the text to warn readers about pitfalls and misconceptions that bedevil students. Each chapter is capped by a large problem set. 
The author has drawn on his own research and the current literature to ensure that appropriate attention is given to topics across the range of modern organic chemistry. The text is unique in its inclusion of a chapter on reactions mediated or catalyzed by transition metals, an area in which mechanistic understanding is now essential. Relatively new topics such as olefin metathesis and cycloaromatization are covered without giving short shrift to more traditional areas such as carbonyl chemistry. The text assumes a basic knowledge of organic chemistry. It can be used either in a formal course or by students working on their own, and will be particularly useful for graduate students studying for qualifying examinations. It will also be useful to students and researchers in biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry.

Reviews




From the reviews of the second edition:
"… Grossman’s book differs from others in the scale of the worked examples. The number of problems incorporated into the text is extraordinary. The author provides the student a Web site that includes the detailed mechanisms for every problem in the book, each of which includes explanation and commentary, and the answer set, when printed, exceeds 250 pages! . . . In style, The Art of… is unique in that it does not read like a typical textbook. Instead, the feel is like that of having a personal tutor next to you walking you through the chemistry in a step-by-step fashion. The writing is clear, concise, engaging, and, at times, outright entertaining. The lively style includes "Common Error Alerts" that teach students what not to do and includes tips and advice on how to solve problems . . . The highest compliment a reviewer can give is to adopt the text that he reviews. The next advanced course I teach will use The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms with the goal that students will be able to posit a plausible mechanism for any new reaction that they encounter. To those of you who have taught traditional physical organic chemistry out of the classic texts, I ask you to consider trying something, well… completely different. The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms might just change the way you do things."
-Journal of Chemical Education
"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms has an entirely different scope, dedicated to teaching the application of first principles to the construction of organic mechanisms. … The number of problems incorporated into the text is extraordinary. The author provides the student a Web site that includes the detailed mechanisms for every problem in the book … . The writing is clear, concise, engaging and, at times, outright entertaining. … All sections are expertly written, well organized and up-to-date." (R. W. Holman, Journal of Chemical Education, Vol. 80 (11), 2003)
"In principle, most mechanisms are derived from a basis set of fundamental steps. … Grossman has succeeded in explaining these fundamentals in detail in an easily accessible monograph. … Readers can reinforce their incipient skills with practical illustrations, and are challenged throughout with complicated examples. … the present text offers additional lucid explanations and ideal opportunities for practice. This work will thus be indispensable for students who are interested in mechanisms, or who wish to gain an additional perspective." (www.organische-chemie.ch, July, 2004)
"This text shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. … It can be used either in a formal course or by students working on their own, and will be particularly useful for graduate students studying for qualifying examinations. It will also be useful to students and researchers in biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry." (Chimie Nouvelle, Vol. 84 (21), 2003)
"Robert Grossman in his book attempts to familiarize the student with the awesome power of reaction mechanisms … . What makes this book special and praise-worthy is the clarity of its presentation of the subject matter. The text is lucid and sharp-edged throughout. The production quality of the book is first-class, too. Paper, printing and binding are excellent, the reproduction of the numerous formulae and reaction schemes is outstanding. … Full marks for this ‘survival guide’ to the ‘organic jungle’." (T. Lazar, Synthesis, Issue 17, 2003)
"The book entitled ‘The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms’ … shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. The discussion is organized by types of mechanisms and the conditions under which the reaction is executed, rather than by the overall reaction as is the case in most textbooks. … Each chapter is capped by a large problem set. … The book will be useful to students and researchers in intermediate organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry." (Process - Magazin für Chemietechnik, Vol. 6 (3), 2003)
"Robert Grossman discusses ideas on organic chemical reactivity, selectivity and structure in a logical way that gives the student confidence in attempting the many practice problems provided. … This book provides a snapshot of examples of how to consider and approach the writing of simple and sophisticated examples of pushing electrons in and out of orbitals. Students will enormously benefit from using the principles and concepts in this book in writing their own mechanisms." (Helmut Hügel, Chemistry in Australia, 2003)

Shore Orthopaedic Group LLCManual Therapy20-30 minutes after the procedure, you will move your back to try to provoke your usual pain. You will report your remaining pain, (if any) and also record the relief you experience during the next week, on a pain diary we will provide. You may or may not obtain improvement in the first few hours after the injection, depending on if the sacroiliac joint is your main pain source. *Mail or fax the completed pain diary back as directed so that your treating physician can be informed of your results and plan future tests and/or treatment if needed.* On occasion, you may feel numb, slightly weak or have an odd feeling in your leg for a few hours after the injection. You may notice a slight increase in your pain lasting for several days as the numbing medication wears off before the cortisone is effective. Ice will typically be more helpful than heat in the first 2-3 days after the injection. You may begin to notice an improvement in your pain 2-5 days after the injection. If you do not notice improvement within 10 days after the injection, it is unlikely to occur. You may take your regular medications after procedure, but try to limit them for the first 4-6 hours after the procedure, so that the diagnostic information obtained from the procedure is accurate. You may be referred for physical or manual therapy after the injection while the numbing medicine is effective and/or over the next several weeks while the cortisone is working. On the day of the injection, you should not drive and should avoid any strenuous activities. On the day after the procedure, you may return to your regular activities. When your pain is improved, start your regular exercise/activities in moderation. Even if you are significantly improved, gradually increase your activities over 1-2 weeks to avoid recurrence of your pain.Physical TherapyYou should be able to resume normal activities by the next day. If you are going for physical therapy, you should continue.Tennis ElbowWhether a patient seeks treatment for tennis elbow, lumbar pain, a dislocated shoulder or stress fractures in the foot, Shore Orthopaedic Group will not rest until our patients receive the best care available.Send to PhoneGrossman Robert B MD1322 Route 72 W, Manahawkin, NJ 08050(609) 597-1377Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailGrossman Robert B MD1322 Route 72 W, Manahawkin, NJ 08050(609) 597-1377Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

This resulted in the wrong procedure with unsuccessful results.  I now see a new doctor to repair my knee.  Grossman is too arrogant to listen, too unorganized to be effective and too set in his ways to treat you as an individual instead of a knee. He is the worst kind of doctor - the kind who thinks that they know your body better than you and therefore your contributions are disregarded.  Lastly, keep an eye on your bill for 'mistakes'. Better yet, don't go!.55-Jon Salnick in Eatontown, NJ | Mar 11, 2016I have nothing but positive things to say about Dr. Grossman.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Grossman has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for New Jersey.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Grossman's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Grossman's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Grossman is Board Certified in:Orthopedic SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Medical Specialties ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

Research Interests: Synthetic Organic ChemistryBiosynthesis 



EducationA.B., Princeton University, 1987
	Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1992 



ResearchOur group develops new synthetic methods and applies them to the synthesis of natural products and biologically relevant compounds. Students learn skills that prepare them for employment in the pharmaceutical and contract synthesis industries.
In a collaborative project with Prof. Chris Schardl in the College of Agriculture, we are elucidating the biosynthetic route to loline alkaloids, naturally occurring insecticides that are produced by fungi that live between the cell walls of certain grasses. We use various synthetic and molecular biology techniques to identify intermediates along the biosynthetic pathway and to identify the enzymes that catalyze the formation of those intermediates. We are also exploring new total synthetic routes to loline.
 



New PedagogyI am the author of The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms, an intermediate-level textbook for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. 
I am also a creator of ACE Organic, a Web-based program for organic chemistry homework that guides students to the correct answer without giving away the answer.
