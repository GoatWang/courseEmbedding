WHERE TO FIND
















Hibiki® Japanese Harmony encapsulates the harmony that exists between Japanese nature and people.Inspired by the riches and subtleties of Japan’s 24 seasons and mastered by Suntory’s Art of Blending, Hibiki® Japanese Harmony is a meticulous blend of the finest select whiskies from the House of Suntory Whisky.It is a symphony of at least 10 malt and grain whiskies, aged in five different types of casks, from Suntory’s Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita distilleries.This delicate blend creates a oneness unfolding a full orchestra of flavours and aromas.The Suntory Whisky blending team is led by third-generation Master Blender and grandson of the founder, Shingo Torii, and fourth Chief Blender Shinji Fukuyo.



“In philosophy and making, Hibiki® Japanese Harmony is the new dawn of Hibiki®, optimizing the same key malt and grain whiskies from the original Hibiki® blend. I envisioned a luminous harmony of flavours and aromas. A pure and simultaneously complex harmony that was at the core of every Hibiki® blend.”
Chief BlenderShinji Fukuyo


Hibiki® Japanese Harmony is heralded as the foundation of the Hibiki® range, leveraging the same key malt and grain whiskies from the original Hibiki® blend, Hibiki® 17 Years and Hibiki® 21 Years.American White Oak malt whiskies create a solid base. The rare Mizunara (Japanese oak) and sherry cask malt whiskies are the dressing.The smoky malt whiskies enact as subtle accents to create depth and further complexity.Grain whiskies from Suntory’s Chita distillery act as the “dashi,”or broth, to complete the personality of the malt whiskies and enhance their overall harmony. Hibiki® Japanese Harmony is extremely versatile.Whether enjoyed neat, on the rocks, blended with water or mixed as a cocktail, the harmony of this blend remains complete.
It is a delicately balanced, smooth and subtly sweet blended whisky that enhances any dining experience.We recommend it be enjoyed with a hand-carved iceball for the ultimate Japanese whisky experience. Hibiki® is embraced as the paragon of the Art of Japanese Whisky.It is not only Japan’s most highly awarded blended whisky, but also among the most prestigious and honoured whiskies in the world.Hibiki® Japanese Harmony is the perfect introduction to the award winning Hibiki® portfolio from the House of Suntory Whisky.
