DDR Corp (DDR) Q2 FFO Beats Estimates, Revenues Miss


July 27, 2017, 10:43:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  DDR Corp. DDR  reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the number declined 3 cents from the prior-year quarter.    Dilutive effect of deleveraging generated through sale of assets was primarily responsible for the decline in FFO.    This real estate investment trust (REIT) posted revenues of $227.4 million for the second quarter, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228 million. The figure also came in lower than $245.8 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.   DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise        DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise    |      DDR Corp. Quote   Note: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent   funds from operations (FFO) per share.    Quarter in Detai  l    DDR signed 258 new and renewal leases for 1.9 million square feet of space during the quarter. On a pro rata basis and including Puerto Rico, the company generated new leasing spreads of 10% and renewal leasing spreads of 5.7% for the quarter. Also, same-store net operating income (NOI), including Puerto Rico, edged down 0.1% year over year on a pro rata basis.    As of Jun 30, 2017, the company's portfolio was 93.7% leased, down 240 basis points from the prior-year quarter end. Annualized base rent per occupied square foot increased 7.8% on a pro rata basis to $16.09 as of Jun 30, 2017, from $14.92 at the end of the year-ago quarter.    During the reported quarter, DDR completed its strategic planning and portfolio review process timely. Consequently, the company realized $28.1 million of impairment charges on two undeveloped land parcels and a shopping centre. It also sold two Puerto Rico based shopping centers for $57.3 million. Nine shopping centers in the U.S. were sold for an aggregate price of $149.2 million, of which DDR's share totaled $137.5 million.    DDR exited the second quarter with $414.1 million in cash compared with $30.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.   2017 Outlook Remains Unchanged    The company's expectation regarding its same-store NOI growth rate remained constant in the range of -1.5-0.0%.   Bottom Line  DDR deleveraged its balance sheet and stretched the average debt maturity period by selling off assets and gaining access to capital markets. This resulted in asset sale and loan repayment proceeds of $237.5 million, aggregating to $225.7 million. Recovering from large scale tenant bankruptcy, the company displayed strong financial results and efficient operational execution.    However, declining same-store net operating income growth, fall in occupancy and the dilutive effects of divestitures cannot be ignored. Also, rate hike and competition from other retailers, such as e-commerce and catalogs, add to its woes.    Currently, DDR carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).    You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  .    The stock has lost 32.5% year to date versus the 3.8% decline of the industry  it belongs to.       We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust RPT  , Boston Properties, Inc. BXP  and Macerich Company (The) MAC  . While Ramco-Gershenson Properties and Boston Properties are scheduled to announce results on Aug 1, Macerich Company is slated to report Q2 numbers on Aug 2.   Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.

DDR Corp. headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio


DDR Corp. is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that owns and manages value-oriented, open-air retail shopping centers, or "power centers" in the United States mainland and Puerto Rico. The company was founded in 1965 and is based in Beachwood, Ohio, an eastern suburb of Greater Cleveland. It operates in approximately 40 continental U.S. states and in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

History[edit]
The company's roots go back to a group of companies established by lawyer and single family home builder Bert Wolstein, an alumnus of Cleveland–Marshall College of Law. In 1965 he switched to commercial real estate and began a partnership with Kmart, with the first one built in 1965.
DDR filed its initial public offering of Common Shares on February 2, 1993. The price at that time was $22.00 per share, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DDR on February 2, 1993.[3]
On September 12, 2011 the company announced plans to change its name from Developers Diversified Realty Corporation to DDR Corp., adopting the NYSE ticker symbol as its name.[4] The new name was chosen to represent a simplified strategy, portfolio and capital structure, as the words “developers” and “diversified” no longer accurately describe the company’s focus. Ground-up development of shopping centers is still a part of the company’s business, but does not warrant top billing in the company’s name. Further, the company’s focus on power centers renders the word “diversified” inaccurate. In September 2011, the company also launched a new tagline: “Think Retail. Create Value.” The new tagline was meant to emphasize the company’s objective to see the world through the eyes of its customers – retailers - and that the company’s primary reason for being is to create shareholder value.[5]
In August 2013, DDR and Blackstone Group’s joint venture acquired a portfolio of seven open-air shopping centers from Regency Centers Corporation for $332 million.[6]
In March 2014, DDR agreed to exit its Brazilian joint venture by selling its stake to the firm’s largest shareholder for $343.6 million.[7]
In October 2014, DDR closed on its third joint venture with Blackstone Group, the acquisition of 70 shopping centers totaling 15.7 million square feet for $1.93 billion. The portfolio primarily consists of prime power centers located in Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Phoenix and is occupied by retailers such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, The Fresh Market, Costco, Target, Walmart, Kohl's, PetSmart, , Bed Bath & Beyond, and the TJX Companies.[8]
In February 2014, David Oakes was appointed as DDR’s president and chief executive officer. Previously, Oakes had served as the company’s president and chief financial officer.[9]
In Q1 2016, DDR reported that due to strong demand in the retail sector, the company would sell between $600 to $800 million of its retail portfolio.[10] The move to sell is an attempt to upgrade the overall quality of its portfolio. The company will be selling its lower class malls.[10]
Operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2014, the leased rate of the company’s portfolio stood at 95.7%, up from 90.7% in July 2009.[11]
The company invests in regional power centers located in large and supply-constrained markets occupied by national retailers. Core tenants include Wal-Mart, Kohl's, T.J. Maxx, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Michaels and Lowe's.[12] As of December 31, 2014, the company owned and managed approximately 400 retail properties in the continental United States and Puerto Rico.[13]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

DDR Corp. headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio


DDR Corp. is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that owns and manages value-oriented, open-air retail shopping centers, or "power centers" in the United States mainland and Puerto Rico. The company was founded in 1965 and is based in Beachwood, Ohio, an eastern suburb of Greater Cleveland. It operates in approximately 40 continental U.S. states and in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

History[edit]
The company's roots go back to a group of companies established by lawyer and single family home builder Bert Wolstein, an alumnus of Cleveland–Marshall College of Law. In 1965 he switched to commercial real estate and began a partnership with Kmart, with the first one built in 1965.
DDR filed its initial public offering of Common Shares on February 2, 1993. The price at that time was $22.00 per share, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DDR on February 2, 1993.[3]
On September 12, 2011 the company announced plans to change its name from Developers Diversified Realty Corporation to DDR Corp., adopting the NYSE ticker symbol as its name.[4] The new name was chosen to represent a simplified strategy, portfolio and capital structure, as the words “developers” and “diversified” no longer accurately describe the company’s focus. Ground-up development of shopping centers is still a part of the company’s business, but does not warrant top billing in the company’s name. Further, the company’s focus on power centers renders the word “diversified” inaccurate. In September 2011, the company also launched a new tagline: “Think Retail. Create Value.” The new tagline was meant to emphasize the company’s objective to see the world through the eyes of its customers – retailers - and that the company’s primary reason for being is to create shareholder value.[5]
In August 2013, DDR and Blackstone Group’s joint venture acquired a portfolio of seven open-air shopping centers from Regency Centers Corporation for $332 million.[6]
In March 2014, DDR agreed to exit its Brazilian joint venture by selling its stake to the firm’s largest shareholder for $343.6 million.[7]
In October 2014, DDR closed on its third joint venture with Blackstone Group, the acquisition of 70 shopping centers totaling 15.7 million square feet for $1.93 billion. The portfolio primarily consists of prime power centers located in Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Phoenix and is occupied by retailers such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, The Fresh Market, Costco, Target, Walmart, Kohl's, PetSmart, , Bed Bath & Beyond, and the TJX Companies.[8]
In February 2014, David Oakes was appointed as DDR’s president and chief executive officer. Previously, Oakes had served as the company’s president and chief financial officer.[9]
In Q1 2016, DDR reported that due to strong demand in the retail sector, the company would sell between $600 to $800 million of its retail portfolio.[10] The move to sell is an attempt to upgrade the overall quality of its portfolio. The company will be selling its lower class malls.[10]
Operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2014, the leased rate of the company’s portfolio stood at 95.7%, up from 90.7% in July 2009.[11]
The company invests in regional power centers located in large and supply-constrained markets occupied by national retailers. Core tenants include Wal-Mart, Kohl's, T.J. Maxx, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Michaels and Lowe's.[12] As of December 31, 2014, the company owned and managed approximately 400 retail properties in the continental United States and Puerto Rico.[13]

DDR Corp. headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio


DDR Corp. is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that owns and manages value-oriented, open-air retail shopping centers, or "power centers" in the United States mainland and Puerto Rico. The company was founded in 1965 and is based in Beachwood, Ohio, an eastern suburb of Greater Cleveland. It operates in approximately 40 continental U.S. states and in the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

History[edit]
The company's roots go back to a group of companies established by lawyer and single family home builder Bert Wolstein, an alumnus of Cleveland–Marshall College of Law. In 1965 he switched to commercial real estate and began a partnership with Kmart, with the first one built in 1965.
DDR filed its initial public offering of Common Shares on February 2, 1993. The price at that time was $22.00 per share, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DDR on February 2, 1993.[3]
On September 12, 2011 the company announced plans to change its name from Developers Diversified Realty Corporation to DDR Corp., adopting the NYSE ticker symbol as its name.[4] The new name was chosen to represent a simplified strategy, portfolio and capital structure, as the words “developers” and “diversified” no longer accurately describe the company’s focus. Ground-up development of shopping centers is still a part of the company’s business, but does not warrant top billing in the company’s name. Further, the company’s focus on power centers renders the word “diversified” inaccurate. In September 2011, the company also launched a new tagline: “Think Retail. Create Value.” The new tagline was meant to emphasize the company’s objective to see the world through the eyes of its customers – retailers - and that the company’s primary reason for being is to create shareholder value.[5]
In August 2013, DDR and Blackstone Group’s joint venture acquired a portfolio of seven open-air shopping centers from Regency Centers Corporation for $332 million.[6]
In March 2014, DDR agreed to exit its Brazilian joint venture by selling its stake to the firm’s largest shareholder for $343.6 million.[7]
In October 2014, DDR closed on its third joint venture with Blackstone Group, the acquisition of 70 shopping centers totaling 15.7 million square feet for $1.93 billion. The portfolio primarily consists of prime power centers located in Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Phoenix and is occupied by retailers such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, The Fresh Market, Costco, Target, Walmart, Kohl's, PetSmart, , Bed Bath & Beyond, and the TJX Companies.[8]
In February 2014, David Oakes was appointed as DDR’s president and chief executive officer. Previously, Oakes had served as the company’s president and chief financial officer.[9]
In Q1 2016, DDR reported that due to strong demand in the retail sector, the company would sell between $600 to $800 million of its retail portfolio.[10] The move to sell is an attempt to upgrade the overall quality of its portfolio. The company will be selling its lower class malls.[10]
Operations[edit]
As of December 31, 2014, the leased rate of the company’s portfolio stood at 95.7%, up from 90.7% in July 2009.[11]
The company invests in regional power centers located in large and supply-constrained markets occupied by national retailers. Core tenants include Wal-Mart, Kohl's, T.J. Maxx, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Michaels and Lowe's.[12] As of December 31, 2014, the company owned and managed approximately 400 retail properties in the continental United States and Puerto Rico.[13]

"Our second quarter results were characterized by strong financial and operational execution. We made progress reducing leverage and lengthening our average debt maturity by selling assets and accessing the capital markets. Our operations were ahead of plan and we completed our portfolio review and strategic planning process over a compressed time-period. I am excited about continuing to execute on these plans, which should position the company for strong future growth," commented David R. Lukes, president and chief executive officer. 
Financial Highlights

Second quarter net income attributable to common shareholders was $23.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $35.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago-period. The year-over-year decline in net income attributable to common shareholders is primarily attributable to impairment charges aggregating $28.1 million recorded on one shopping center and two parcels of undeveloped land. 
Second quarter operating funds from operations attributable to common shareholders ("Operating FFO" or "OFFO") was $108.8 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $122.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share in the year ago-period. The year-over-year decrease in OFFO is primarily attributable to the dilutive impact of deleveraging asset sales.

Significant Second Quarter Activity
Asset Sales

Generated total asset sales and loan repayment proceeds of $237.5 million, totaling $225.7 million at DDR's share 
Sold two shopping centers in Puerto Rico for an aggregate sales price of $57.3 million

Recapitalized the DDR Domestic Retail Fund I joint venture which included a new $707 million mortgage loan on 52 assets to repay all of the joint venture's outstanding mortgage debt

Key Operating Results

Reported a decrease in same store net operating income, including Puerto Rico, of -0.1% on a pro rata basis; and excluding Puerto Rico, same store net operating income was flat on a pro rata basis; presentation has been adjusted to include bad debt expense on a comparable basis 
Executed 258 new leases and renewals for 1.9 million square feet 
Generated new leasing spreads of 10.0% and renewal leasing spreads of 5.7%, both on a pro rata basis and including Puerto Rico for the quarter, and new leasing spreads of 10.4% and renewal leasing spreads of 6.5%, both on a pro rata basis and including Puerto Rico for the trailing twelve-month period 
Reported a portfolio leased rate of 93.7% at June 30, 2017, compared to 96.1% at June 30, 2016, on a pro rata basis 
Annualized base rent per occupied square foot on a pro rata basis was $16.09 at June 30, 2017, compared to $14.92 at June 30, 2016

Other Significant Activity

Completed the previously announced portfolio review and strategic planning process. 
As a result of a full portfolio review and subsequent decision on asset sales, the Company recorded impairment charges on one shopping center and two parcels of undeveloped land aggregating $28.1 million in the second quarter.

 DDR Share 


 U.S. Portfolio 
 (1.0%) – 0.5% 


 Total  Portfolio 
 (1.5%) – 0.0% 





Expected leased rate at year end of 93.0% to 93.5% 
Expected General and Administrative expenses of $72 million to $75 million 
Expected Fee income of $30 million to $33 million 
Expected Interest income of $26 million to $29 million

Conference Call and Supplemental InformationThe Company will hold its quarterly conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. To participate with access to the slide presentation, please visit the Investors portion of DDR's website, www.ddr.com/events, or for audio only, dial 877-249-1119 (U.S.), 855-669-9657 (Canada) or 412-542-4143 (international) at least ten minutes prior to the scheduled start of the call. A replay of the conference call will also be available at www.ddr.com/events for one year after the call. A copy of the Company's Supplemental package is available on the Company's website at www.ddr.com.
Non-GAAP MeasuresFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used as a standard in the real estate industry and is a widely accepted measure of real estate investment trust ("REIT") performance. Management believes that both FFO and Operating FFO provide additional indicators of the financial performance of a REIT. The Company also believes that FFO and Operating FFO more appropriately measure the core operations of the Company and provide benchmarks to its peer group. 
FFO is generally defined and calculated by the Company as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude:  (i) preferred share dividends, (ii) gains and losses from disposition of depreciable real estate property and related investments, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) impairment charges on depreciable real estate property and related investments and (iv) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation and amortization of intangibles, equity income (loss) from joint ventures and equity income (loss) from non-controlling interests and adding the Company's proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests, determined on a consistent basis. The Company's calculation of FFO is consistent with the NAREIT definition. The Company calculates Operating FFO by excluding certain non-operating charges and gains. Operating FFO is useful to investors as the Company removes non-comparable charges and gains to analyze the results of its operations and assess performance of the core operating real estate portfolio. Other real estate companies may calculate FFO and Operating FFO in a different manner. 
The Company also uses net operating income ("NOI"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental performance measure. NOI is calculated as property revenues less property-related expenses. The Company believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and, when compared across periods, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis. 
The Company presents NOI information herein on a same store basis or "SSNOI." The Company defines SSNOI as property revenues less property-related expenses, which exclude straight-line rental income and expenses, lease termination income, management fee expense, fair market value of leases and expense recovery adjustments. The Company presents SSNOI both with and without provisions for uncollectible amounts and/or recoveries thereof. In addition, the Company presents SSNOI both with and without the results of its Puerto Rico portfolio. SSNOI also excludes activity associated with development and major redevelopment and single tenant assets and includes assets owned in comparable periods (15 months for quarter comparisons). SSNOI excludes all non-property and corporate level revenue and expenses. Other real estate companies may calculate NOI and SSNOI in a different manner. The Company believes SSNOI provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performances of comparable assets because it excludes certain non-cash and non-comparable items as noted above.
FFO, Operating FFO, NOI and SSNOI do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company's operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release and the accompanying financial supplement. 
Safe HarborDDR Corp. considers portions of the information in this press release to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, with respect to the Company's expectation for future periods.

Its portfolio includes some 500 community shopping centers, malls, and other retail properties in the US, Brazil, and Puerto Rico. All together DDR owns more than 120 million sq. ft of space and more than 1,800 acres of undeveloped land. Almost half of its shopping centers are owned through joint ventures. DDR's largest tenants include Wal-Mart, PetSmart, TJX, and Kohl's. No longer primarily a development firm, the REIT changed its name to DDR in 2011.
