										GK Investment Holdings Ltd is owned by KANKU MBWANYA SHAMBUYI (this is the name as per his passport) who will also go by the name of Dr. Jean Jacques Kanku. 
Kanku claims to be a collateral provider of financial instruments. As part of the transaction, Kanku will take an upfront fee, which he will tell you is fully refundable if the transaction does not take place. Once the fee has been paid nothing will happen on the transaction and KANKU WILL NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK.
This guy is a fraud.

An investment in the Bonds is subject to certain risks and should be made only persons or entities able to bear the risk of and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Currently, there is no market for the Bonds being offered. There can be no assurance that a public market will develop, therefore, it may be difficult to sell your Bonds.
