Bill O’Neil is an accomplished trial lawyer who concentrates his practice on a variety of business disputes.
M&A LitigationA significant portion of Bill's practice involves representing private equity funds and their portfolio companies. Bill frequently represents buyers and sellers in post-closing disputes, including working capital, representation and warranty, and fraud claims. Bill also represents buyers in claims against representation and warranty insurance carriers. More than a dozen private equity funds have retained Bill to handle these disputes; often where another law firm handled the underlying transaction. He brings a practical, business-minded approach to contentious disputes; he is frequently praised by his clients for the depth of his understanding of M&A transactions.    
Complex Commercial Litigation Mr. O’Neil also represents numerous public company clients in corporate governance litigation, shareholder strike suits, internal investigations, and other complex business litigation. He has represented dozens of Fortune 500 companies in disputes ranging from routine to high-stakes, “bet the company” litigation. Mr. O’Neil is also frequently called upon to provide risk management and litigation avoidance advice to his clients.
Antitrust Litigation Mr. O’Neil has significant antitrust experience. He was defense counsel in In re Automotive Parts Litigation, In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, and In re Sulfuric Acid Litigation, and successfully prosecuted price-fixing claims on behalf of Solyndra LLC against three of China’s largest solar panel manufacturers.
Pro BonoMr. O’Neil’s pro bono cases have included representing a prison inmate in a successful appeal before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals that resulted in new law in the circuit, the court’s reversal of its own prior precedent, and the reversal of the defendant’s conviction. 



Honors & Awards
In 2016, Bill was named to Benchmark Litigation’s “Under 40 Hot List.” This national award recognizes the nation’s most accomplished trial lawyers under the age of 40 based upon a peer review and case examination process.
In 2015, Bill was one of only 16 lawyers invited to participate in Microsoft’s Advocacy Academy, a week-long intensive trial skills course dedicated to the development of Microsoft’s next-generation of trial lawyers. 
Also in 2015, Winston & Strawn was named the “Chicago Litigation Department of the Year” for general litigation by The National Law Journal.




Activities
Bill serves as the co-chair of Winston’s Hiring Committee. In this role, he oversees Winston’s associate hiring on a firmwide basis. In addition, Bill serves as the liaison between the Firm’s Associates Committee and its Executive Committee. During his tenure, Winston has ascended more than 100 spots in the American Lawyer’s Mid-Level Associate Satisfaction Survey and now owns a spot as a Top 20 firm.  
A member of the Board of Directors of The First Tee of Greater Chicago (TFTGC), an organization dedicated to teaching life skills through the game of golf to at-risk youth in the Chicagoland area, Bill is committed to his community. He serves as the Chair of TFTGC’s Governance & Nominating Committee. During his tenure on the Board, TFTGC has more than doubled in size—both financially and in terms of the number of youth impacted.

Highlights, News & Knowledge

 

William C. O'Neill is a partner and co-chair of the firm's Insurance/Reinsurance  Group. His practice focuses primarily on arbitrations and litigations on  behalf of insurers, reinsurers, and health  care companies. He has been recognized as a top insurance and reinsurance attorney in Chambers USA (2014-2016), as well as Euromoney's Guide to the World's Leading Insurance & Reinsurance Attorneys (2008 thru present) and the International Who's Who of Insurance and Reinsurance Lawyers.
Bill has been involved in hundreds of disputes involving issues  in life, health, and property/casualty insurance and reinsurance issues. He has  represented clients in disputes involving yearly renewable term reinsurance  premiums, environmental and asbestos reinsurance allocations, maximum any one  life warranties, extra-contractual obligations, sexual abuse claims, fronting arrangements, sunset  and commutation clauses, actuarial and agency issues, vanishing premium life  insurance policies, cedent insolvencies, long-term care premiums, follow the  fortunes and follow the settlements, late notice, retention warranties, underwriting  and claims handling practices, 9/11 issues, fraud, offset, misrepresentations, recovery  of declaratory judgment expenses, and allegations of misconduct by brokers,  managing general underwriters, and third-party administrators. These disputes  center on many types of underlying exposures and business, including, variable annuities,  individual life, health care, workers' compensation, long-term care, disability  income, accident and health, asbestos, environmental, and construction defect exposures.
In addition to his dispute  work, Bill counsels clients regarding business, strategy, and regulatory matters.  He works closely with the firm's Health Care and Litigation practices and has  worked on insurance-related issues with our International Trade, Intellectual  Property, Corporate, and Antitrust practices.  
A few examples of Bill's  recent experience include:

Defending a national  managed-care organization against claims that it overcharged its reinsured by  over $5 million in premiums. Following an extensive hearing, the arbitration  panel denied the cedent's $5 million claim and awarded our client over $18  million on affirmative non-solicitation claims. 
Obtaining a multi-million  arbitration award for a cedent after its reinsurer challenged the  reasonableness of the cedent's allocation of an underlying asbestos settlement. 
Representing a global  reinsurer in a dispute involving the acquisition of a large block of North  American life insurance business through a coinsurance agreement that contained  unsatisfied conditions to closing. The  dispute centered on the interpretation of those conditions to closing and the  impact of temporary impossibility of performance on the parties' rights and  obligations under the coinsurance agreement.
Representing a reinsurer in  a dispute with its retrocessionaire involving the reinsurer's obligations and  ability to increase premiums on a large book of yearly renewable term life reinsurance. 
Representing cedents and reinsurers in insurance and reinsurance disputes involving educational institutions, including issues relating to reinsurance of self-insured school pools, sexual abuse allegations, policyholder cut through claims, and allegations of bad-faith claim handling.
Representing a cedent in a  dispute with its reinsurer over the reinsurer's challenge to a good faith  settlement relating to the cedent's billings for losses incurred for the  hospitalization of insured critically ill infants. 
Representing a reinsurer in  arbitrations over whether it could raise premiums on a book of yearly renewable  term life reinsurance.
Representing a cedent in a  dispute over the proper application of a retention warranty clause is a treaty  reinsuring a block of disability income business.  
Working with a property/casualty  reinsurer to create a new template for its self-insured pools reinsurance treaty.    
Representing a large  domestic insurer in coverage litigation arising out of underlying "Clean  Room" litigation.
Representing a reinsurer in  a dispute with its cedent over a facultatively reinsured life insurance policy  containing material misrepresentations that the insurer's agent was aware of at  the time of underwriting but that were never disclosed to the  reinsurer. Our client achieved a complete victory and the cedent was  ordered to repay one hundred percent of the amount in dispute, plus interest. 

Bill is a graduate of  Cornell Law School and Towson University where he was named outstanding  graduate of the Economics Department for 1992. He is a frequent speaker on reinsurance issues and has served on the faculty at numerous training seminars for reinsurance arbitrators. He is a member of the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society (ARIAS-US) education committee, a former chair of the Excess, Surplus Lines and Reinsurance Committee of the Torts and Insurance Practice Section of the American Bar Association, and a member of the American Health Lawyers Association.
In The News
                            In August 2009, Bill was featured in InsuranceLaw360 with a Q&A on his practice, the complexity of his cases, and his most notable accomplishments as a lawyer.
