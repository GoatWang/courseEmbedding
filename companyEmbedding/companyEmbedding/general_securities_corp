Key Questions
1. If I pass the Series 7, will I be able to trade municipal securities?
If an individual took and passed the Series 7 prior to November 7, 2011, he or she will be able to trade municipal securities, structure municipal securities underwritings and perform certain other activities involving municipal securities. 
If an individual took and passed the Series 7 on or after November 7, 2011, he or she will be qualified to engage only in municipal securities sales to, and purchases from customers.  If an individual wants to be qualified to structure municipal securities underwritings or perform activities involving municipal securities that are beyond the scope of selling municipal securities to and purchasing municipal securities from customers, that individual would have to take and pass the Series 52 (Municipal Securities Representative Exam).
2. Does Series 7 serve as a pre-requisite to the Series 53 (Municipal Securities Principal Exam)?
If an individual took and passed the Series 7 prior to November 7, 2011, he or she is qualified to sit for the Series 53 examination. 
If an individual took and passed the Series 7 on or after November 7, 2011, he or she would have to take and pass the Series 52 (Municipal Securities Representative Exam) as a prerequisite to taking the Series 53 examination.
3. What is the difference between Series 7 and Series 62?
The General Securities Representative Examination (Series 7) is an entry-level examination that qualifies the individual for registration with all self-regulatory organizations to trade:

corporate stocks and bonds


rights


warrants


real estate investment trusts (REITs)


collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)


municipal securities 


options-equity, index, and foreign currency


investment company products/variable contracts


direct participation programs


exchange traded funds (ETFs)

The Corporate Securities Limited Representative Examination (Series 62) satisfies a FINRA qualification requirement for individuals who will trade corporate securities only. These include:

corporate stocks and bonds


rights


warrants


REITs


collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)


exchange traded funds (ETFs)


Using Reference Materials




The test administrator will provide whiteboard/dry erase marker and basic electronic calculators to the candidates, which must be returned to the test center administrator at the end of the testing session. Some test questions involve calculations. Only the provided calculators may be used during the examination.
The examination may contain questions that require the use of exhibits (e.g., charts, graphs, tables). If so, the questions will indicate when to refer to an exhibit.
Candidates are not permitted to bring any reference materials to testing sessions. Severe penalties are imposed on candidates who cheat or attempt to cheat on FINRA administered examinations.
