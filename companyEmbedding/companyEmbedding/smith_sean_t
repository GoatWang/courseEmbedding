Sean T. Smith













                    
                    It's been a joyous, magic, tragic, and ultimately rewarding journey. He's hiked much of the Appalachian Trail, slid down glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, gotten very lost in the Everglades back-country, and fished for Marlin in the Gulf Stream. He dove wrecks in the Caribbean, speared fish with sharks and blood in the water, and drank beer in foreign ports with fellow vagabonds, troubadours, and misfits. He lost his faith and love, yet thankfully they found him again.Sean majored in Political Science at the University of Florida, then moved to Nashville to pursue a career in songwriting. He started writing fiction after moving back to Florida, and now relishes the broader canvas a novel affords, though he''s still known to pick up his guitar from time to time. He considers being a dad the best thing about him, for his children make him a better man.Sean is almost finished with his fifth novel, and already working on number six. At the same time, he is writing for an international video game developer for THE SEED, to be released in 2016   He enjoys interacting with readers, and is easy to find on Facebook, Twitter, Goodreads, LinkedIn, Instagram, and his blog at seantsmithauthor.com.

 Expectations


They shape us, sometimes sculpting with care, but often chipping away at who we could be. For expectations are born both from within and from without. Left unfettered, expectations will crush a soul, reduce an artist to rubble, and smash the joy we should feel every day. 
Our parents start the process… “You go to a good school, get a good job, marry well, have children, and work hard. Go to church on Sundays. We absorb these ideas until they seem to be our own.

 The Art of Hypocrisy


FOLIO VOICES story by SEAN T. SMITH 
The Carl Vinson carrier strike group is poised to unleash hell. President Trump has promised that if China cannot reign in North Korea, the United States will handle the “problem.” In past weeks, the U.S. sent 59 cruise missiles into a Syrian airbase, closing it down for about six hours. Our forces also dropped the MOAB, aka the “mother of all bombs,” on a mountainside in Afghanistan. Cable news media fawned over the “beauty” of our firepower.

She means to mean well; you can almost admire her tenacity. She never quite makes it over the hump to where she actually means well, but you can see that she’d like to. You wish you didn’t hate her, because hating people doesn’t do anybody any good and everybody knows that, but she sure makes it easy, when you figure it out.

 Short Story: The Hill


The Hill 
I’m not sure what’s real and what isn’t anymore; the dreams started again. I wake most nights coated in sweat with a strangled scream on my lips, and the feeling that I can’t breathe. Maybe the nightmare is reality, and I’m only now sliding back to it after all these years. Perhaps I’m dead, after all. There are times, especially in the dark of the night, when the rain beats down on the roof with the sound of a cascade of pebbles and the branches beyond my window sway and lee

 America That Was 


 After the bombs rained down, the world entire was an open wound; it was in those bleeding years that I became a man. I was twelve on November 8, 2016, the day America lost its collective mind, a day which now lives in infamy for those of us who remain, the few that survived The Fall. 
I recall that my father never believed the country would elect The Donald; we used to laugh at the news shows as a family, shaking our heads in disbelief at the words spewing out of the man’s mouth, and

 The Writer… Free short story


The Writer He flowed onto the bar, elbows perched upon the hard edge with his shoulders slumped, a cigarette in one hand while the other aimlessly caressed a shot of whiskey, neat. The smell of stale beer and smoke mingled with decades of accumulated broken dreams and lingering hope. He regarded his reflection in the bar room mirror, and his face, gray-bearded and worn, stared back at him, half obscured behind rows of liquor in the dimly lit dive.

4.0 out of 5 stars"Tears" for Formatting, Cheers for Story ...ByDaniel Charles Rosson April 19, 2016The problem with the recurring concept of one or more states' secession–most recently again with the Texans, whom we should let go–is not editorial: We can craft a story that holds up well enough, as Sean T. Smith has done in spades.  No, the problems in a real-world scenario are political and military.First, there is no practical expectation on God's Green Earth that a state political organization could get motivated enough to move forward on a secession.  Have you *seen* how glacially politicians move?  They can't agree on a lunch menu.  Second, and in conjunction with my first point, Washington would weigh in early and with increasing force, economically, politically and militarily, if it came to that, to prevent a secession.  Ever heard 'a sedition, cowboy?  Sure y'have.As a retired Navy chief petty officer and former active Army criminal investigator, my military objection to these stories is that they often overlook this essential point: All the players in a state are not going to be secessionists, and IRL, they would fight back ferociously.  State National Guard troops could be easily overcome by even the state's own Army/Air Force Reservists, in most cases, just in firepower, let alone the full-on active military bases in a place like Texas that would not fall into the secession line.  Most of all, there is just no conceivable way a civil war will result in a "blue on blue" nuclear exchange, wiping out Washington DC and San Francisco; it isn't entirely clear in the story that this wasn't done by another nation taking advantage of the domestic chaos, but even then, NORAD would still be operational and in full defensive posture.All that said, we read these stories to suspend disbelief, and my disbelief was suspended all to Hell and back reading this engaging novel.Why?  In the classic way of good stories, it rings true.  Here's a small but telling detail: As tough as it is to write dialect in a story, Smith uses the perfect detail to emphasize authenticity when a troop refers to his Sergeant Major, the highest ranking enlisted person in the unit, as "Sarn't Major."  That is spot-on how we fast-talked it when I was an active duty Army military police investigator (since color TV, but before the Internet).The story also correctly respects the bond among the bands of brothers (and sisters), those men and women who have our sixes and stand with us in firing positions regardless of the odds.  He correctly identifies that civil wars–then and now–are fought less by institutional warring factions than people following orders and protecting the soldiers next to them on the line.Beside the military action, of which there is a copious and finely wrought amount, Smith deals with issues facing non-combatants.  How do civilians deal with the uprising, with helicopter gunships firing into their stores and churches *against other Americans*?  Smith forces us to confront the terror and chaos of war waged in the streets and even in traffic jams, not just on random anonymous battefields, and waged by sudden soldiers protecting the weak and defenseless.I took no stars for the sometimes astounding formatting errors, though as a long-time writer and editor myself, they irked me something awful. There are a distressing number of sentences ending in or including partial words: "The media on both sides elevated the rhetoric, pandering to paranoia, infl passions..." Location 294/3701 on my screen; "The soldier was dead before he hit the fl ..." - 2763/3701; "He heard muffl voices." – 2824/3701.  Without looking at every one, it seems that the issue might be with the typeface and the "fl" combination.  There are other miscues a finer weave of editorial cheesecloth might have sifted out.So, four stars for "Tears of Abraham."  (I'm sorry, Sean, but the nuke thing was a bridge too far for me, so that ate a star.)  But now that I've found Mr. Smith, I intend to find and read his other works.  I like his style and his storytelling.I think you will, too.  Strongly recommended.

3.0 out of 5 starsFlawed but To ReadByleeon July 17, 2016I'm a big fan of Sean T Smith.  His ability to create narrative that reads like poetry is a real gift that I appreciate, enormously.  I've never read an author who writes so beautifully.In this book, I felt that his sentence, paragraph  and dialogue practices really interfered with his story.  There were too many incomplete sentences.  He did not use paragraph demarcation such as indentation or line skip.  Curious, I went back and checked his other books.  In his other books he used both.  In his newsletter he uses both.  I like the use of dialogue which he does quite often, but when you have to back and reread to try to figure out who's speaking, that's very distracting.  There are ways that have been around forever for handling dialogue in fiction.  These things interfered with the flow of the story quite significantly as did scene changes.However, I can still give a 3 star; because I'm so grateful he's written another book.  It doesn't reach the depth of his other works, but it is a good read.

    See all 19 reviews4.0 out of 5 stars"Tears" for Formatting, Cheers for Story ...ByDaniel Charles Rosson April 19, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThe problem with the recurring concept of one or more states' secession–most recently again with the Texans, whom we should let go–is not editorial: We can craft a story that holds up well enough, as Sean T. Smith has done in spades.  No, the problems in a real-world scenario are political and military.First, there is no practical expectation on God's Green Earth that a state political organization could get motivated enough to move forward on a secession.  Have you *seen* how glacially politicians move?  They can't agree on a lunch menu.  Second, and in conjunction with my first point, Washington would weigh in early and with increasing force, economically, politically and militarily, if it came to that, to prevent a secession.  Ever heard 'a sedition, cowboy?  Sure y'have.As a retired Navy chief petty officer and former active Army criminal investigator, my military objection to these stories is that they often overlook this essential point: All the players in a state are not going to be secessionists, and IRL, they would fight back ferociously.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsRed vs. Blue for the ultimate prize: America itselfByCTon April 8, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseBefore we begin this, I'd like to mention my disappointment with another book series on a similar topic with the Empire series by Orson Scott Card. I picked that up in order to read about a "Second Civil War" scenario and enjoy the military combat of Red States vs. Blue States. It turned out to be wholesale propaganda for one side and very little actual military fighting. This, by contrast, is everything I wanted from that conflict and I'm rather sad the conflict wasn't spread out over three or four books as there's plenty of room for expansion with the story.Henry and Suzanne are great characters, a troubled married couple who find themselves separated by the entire United States when war breaks out between the two sides. I enjoyed their backstory as it really made them rounded three-dimensional characters who are suffering for very true-to-life problems which happen for military families. The fact Henry isn't a perfect understanding hero separates him from a lot of military science fiction (or speculative fiction in this case) protagonists as he has a lot of petty qualities like being jealous of the fact his wife makes moremoney than him as well as a desire to believe she's cheating on him so he can divorce her.The conflict is less about Red vs. Blue states than discovering who, exactly, pushed both sides to war and stopping them so both can get back to peace. It's a pretty good set up, though I admit I wanted to see both sides blow the hell out of one another regardless of my personal poltiics. It's just such an exciting premise.I have almost no complaints about this book save it perhaps jumps around a bit too much and the paragraphs aren't indented, just separated by spaces. Otherwise, a very enjoyable story.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThis book really makes you think...ByLGT Lilburnon May 7, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI'll start with my complaint....the book is too short! Just as we get to know these people...it's over!  I can only hope there will be more stories to come in this saga.  Once again, Sean T. Smith has crafted a real page turner.  It's hard to imagine Another Civil War in the U.S. and yet Sean shows us the possibility is real.  This isn't War and Peace but rather a quick, concise cautionary tale about "us" letting politics and big business hold sway over our lives; allowing ourselves to be fooled into throwing away our liberty.  I would definitely recommend this book.  You'll be drawn in from the first page and won't be able to put it down till its done!0Comment|

Overview



After the bombs rain down, the entire world is an open wound; it is in those bleeding years that William Fox becomes a man. William flees with his family to Magnolia, a farm in Tennessee, while America descends into madness, anarchy, and death. With the aid of elite Special Forces units, Magnolia emerges as beacon of hope and stability. But evil is hungry and relentless. A new threat stalks the Earth. To save his people, and perhaps all of humanity, William must be more than a lethal soldier; he must become a hero.Objects of Wrath is the first book in a saga spanning four generations. In a depleted and peeled land savaged by The Fall, William struggles to keep the faith and light burning within him.Sometimes, the only way to defeat darkness is to become it."For the few who do what it takes, the end of the world will be a new beginning ... With OBJECTS OF WRATH, Sean Smith offers a fresh take in survivalist fiction." Acclaimed author Craig DiLouie"OBJECTS OF WRATH is disturbing. The end of the world shouldn't be so plausible. Sean Smith's new book squats in the heart twisting intersection of "Full Metal Jacket" and Cormac McCarthy's "The Road"." Author James Crawford

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
