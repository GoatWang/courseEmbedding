You won’t be able to fix Apple AirPods yourself and you probably shouldn’t try












Twitter CTO Adam Messinger, who has been the company’s CTO for almost four years and with the company for five years, said today he was leaving the company. Twitter VP of product Josh McFarland is also leaving to join Greylock Partners.
Messinger made the announcement in — no surprise — a tweet:


After 5 years I’ve decided to leave Twitter and take some time off. Grateful to @jack for the opportunity and to my team for shipping.
— Adam Messinger (@adam_messinger) December 20, 2016



So, in short, the round robin at Twitter’s top echelon continues. Last month, COO Adam Bain left the company as Anthony Noto took over. And now Twitter has lost another pair of top executives. Beyond that, earlier this month Twitter’s director of media partnerships and head of news, government and elections Adam Sharp said he was leaving the company.
Amid all this chaos, sudden changes at the top — which, for Twitter, seems like a regular event at this point — can lead to equal confusion down the ranks, especially as Twitter tries to remake itself into something a little less confusing to attract new users. While Twitter over the years has shored up its reliability (when’s the last time you saw the fail whale?) it still needs to figure out how to keep the upper ranks constant if it’s going to portray an image of stability for current and potential employees.

While departures like Messinger’s aren’t all that uncommon — especially for executives who have been in those positions for a long time, it’s still happening at a rough time in Twitter’s history. Twitter is no stranger to executive departures, but at this moment it’s when the company is reeling from talks of an acquisition falling apart and the company having to figure out how to continue running as an independent company.
It also comes at a time when, while the company was able to deliver some much-needed solid results, it laid off a significant portion of its workforce in October. Twitter had a several-month saga of trying to sell itself to a variety of suitors, including Salesforce, which ultimately walked away from the talks in October shortly before the company reported its Q3 results.
McFarland, meanwhile, was VP of product for nine months and was at the company for around two years after Twitter acquired TellApart. That role has been an even more notorious round-robin, especially as Twitter has tried to figure out how to make the service more attractive and continue to grow — and convince Wall Street that it can last as an independent company.
And the continued decline of Twitter’s stock, which the company very actively uses to attract and compensate talent, isn’t helping either. The company’s stock, since Dorsey took over a little more than a year ago, has in particular not done well:

Here’s how the rest of the changes will shake down, according to The New York Times: Twitter’s heads of product, design and engineering will be reporting directly to CEO Jack Dorsey, while VP of engineering Edward Ho will take over Messinger’s duties and also report to Dorsey. The Times is also reporting that he will not be heading to a competing social networking company.

SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter’s streak of executive turnover is continuing.Adam Messinger, Twitter’s chief technology officer, said in a Twitter message on Tuesday that he was leaving the company. His departure follows that of Adam Bain, Twitter’s chief operating officer, who exited last month. Other top product, engineering and media team leaders have also departed the company this year.“After 5 years I’ve decided to leave Twitter and take some time off,” Mr. Messinger said in the post.

His exit once again raises questions about the stability of Twitter’s executive bench. The social media company has been struggling to attract more users to its 140-character message service while trying to figure out how to improve revenue growth. In recent months, Twitter flirted with selling itself to suitors like Salesforce.com, but discussions ended with no resolution. The company has since been in cost-cutting mode, reducing its staff and shedding some of its businesses.One of the biggest blows to Twitter was the loss of Mr. Bain, who was an unofficial internal mascot beloved by many employees for his cheerful demeanor and his cheerleading of the company. Anthony Noto, who was Twitter’s chief financial officer, took over the chief operating officer position, and the company is now searching for a new C.F.O.

Mr. Messinger was not the only executive to leave Twitter on Tuesday. Josh McFarland, a vice president of product, said he was departing to join the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. Mr. McFarland, who oversaw much of advertising product development, had joined Twitter in April 2015 when Twitter acquired his company, the digital advertising platform TellApart, for about $500 million. Mr. McFarland was a rising star at Twitter; he was respected for being decisive and willing to have hard conversations, former Twitter employees said.

Mr. Messinger joined Twitter in 2011 from the software company Oracle. He began as a vice president working on engineering infrastructure and later moved to a position overseeing application development. He became chief technology officer in 2013. Continue reading the main story

Over the past year, Mr. Messinger had been awarded more responsibilities by Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive. After some executive reshuffling, Mr. Messinger gained oversight of the engineering organization, as well as product development and design. He helped decide on Twitter’s new product leader, Keith Coleman, a former Google employee who had worked on that company’s Gmail and chat apps.Mr. Messinger was awarded 1.25 million restricted stock units for his additional duties. After his departure, Twitter’s heads of product, design and engineering will report directly to Mr. Dorsey. Edward Ho, a vice president of engineering, will take over Mr. Messinger’s engineering duties as general manager reporting to Mr. Dorsey.

“I’ll be working even closer with our engineering and design teams to ensure we continue to be the fastest and best service to show what’s happening in the world,” Mr. Dorsey said in a statement.Mr. Messinger’s supporters at Twitter lauded what they described as his cerebral approach, but he also had detractors who said he was indecisive and sometimes did not take enough concrete steps to make changes happen, according to three former Twitter employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the interactions were private.Mr. Messinger did not say what he would do after leaving Twitter. A person with knowledge of Mr. Messinger’s plans, who asked to remain anonymous because the person was not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Messinger did not plan to head to a competing social network like Facebook or Snapchat.

Twitter lost two more of its senior executives

Former Twitter CTO Adam Messinger.Twitter




Twitter has lost two more of its senior executives as it faces mounting pressure to increase its revenue and grow its user base.
The company's chief technology officer, Adam Messinger, and VP of product, Josh McFarland, both announced that they are leaving the company on Tuesday.
Messinger has been Twitter's CTO since 2013, and joined the company in 2011 from Oracle. McFarland joined Twitter in 2015 through its $532 million acquisition of his ad tech startup TellApart.
Both departures come shortly after longtime Twitter COO Adam Bain abruptly stepped down in early November. Twitter also lost its vice president of ad sales, Richard Alfonsi, to Stripe in early December.
A Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider on Tuesday that the company is "taking steps to streamline and flatten the organization" by having its engineering, product and design departments now report directly to CEO Jack Dorsey.
"We believe these updates to our organizational structure will enable increased discipline in our product strategy and faster execution," the spokesperson said.
Twitter promoted Anthony Noto from CFO to COO when Bain left in November. The company is still looking for a permanent CFO while Noto fills both roles.

Adam Messinger is leaving Twitter after three years as its chief technology officer.
                                                    Messinger Twitter profile
                                                Twitter Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger said Tuesday he would leave the company, becoming the latest key executive to depart the social media company this year.Messinger announced his departure in a tweet, saying he was going to take some time off. Messinger, who joined Twitter in 2011 as vice president of app development in the engineering department, was appointed chief technical officer in 2013.Messinger's announcement comes the same day as Twitter's vice president of product, Josh McFarland tweeted that he was leaving the social network to become a partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners.  Ed Ho, who has been in charge of product at Twitter, will take over all product and engineering and report directly to CEO Jack Dorsey, Recode reported, citing people familiar with the restructuring."We're taking steps to streamline and flatten the organization by elevating our engineering, product and design functions, with each area now reporting directly to Jack," a company spokesperson said in an email.



 The departures are the latest in a string of executives who have left the company this year. Adam Bain, the company's former chief operating officer, announced his resignation last month, following product head Kevin Weil, who departed Twitter for Instagram in March.The social network has struggled in recent years as user growth has flatlined, infuriating Wall Street and efforts to transform the platform into a live-streaming hub, including airing Thursday night NFL games, are yielding mixed results.

Twitter’s chief technology officer, the man overseeing a system that processes a half-billion Tweets a day, grew up in tiny Summerville (current population: 135), the son of a forester and teacher in an eastern Oregon farming community 15 miles north of La Grande. In seventh grade, Adam Messinger’s parents bought him a Commodore 64 – the rudimentary but beloved computer from the dawn of the PC era, which became the inspiration for many a technology career. Messinger taught himself programming from books, learning on his own or by trading tips with a friend. Later, as a physics major at Willamette University, Messinger found himself rewriting the software in physics labs over the summer and gravitated to a career in computing at tiny startups and big companies. He joined Twitter two years ago, just as the company captured the public consciousness with its constant stream of user-generated news, emotion and entertainment.Today, at Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco, Messinger oversees the technology that underlies the service and pursues a ridiculously ambitious goal: Reaching every person on earth.Still a regular visitor to Oregon (Messinger’s parents remain in eastern Oregon, and he was in Hillsboro this week for a talk at Intel) Messinger spoke with The Oregonian about his roots in the Northwest, Twitter’s connective power and Portland’s tech ecosystem. (The conversation has been edited for clarity.)Adam Messinger
Age: 42
Title: Chief technology officer, Twitter.
Hometown: Summerville, Ore.
Education: Imbler High School, one of 36 students in the Class of 1990; Willamette University Class of 1994, majored in physics and computer science.
Family: Wife, Mary Powell, a San Francisco tax attorney whom he met at Willamette; they have to daughters, Sophia and Penelope.The Oregonian: How does somebody come from small-town, rural eastern Oregon, and a liberal arts school in Salem, get to California and a top job at one of the tech industry’s hottest companies?Adam Messinger: My parents were a non-negligible part of that. My dad has a master’s degree in forestry, my mom, before she had kids, was a teacher. They were foundational. We traveled a lot, even though we lived out there. That made it possible for me to imagine it.I loved growing up there, but I always knew that I was going to end up getting a job in technology. I went to Willamette because it seemed like the best school for me in Oregon. I started there as a physics major, I worked at a couple physics labs over the summer and I found myself rewriting their software all the time. And I decided I would do that. I’m very happy I have a physics degree. It’s great training to think.You were at several different companies in the Silicon Valley early in your career, and at Oracle until you joined Twitter about two years ago. How did you find Twitter, and how did Twitter find you?I knew a board member at Twitter, his name is Peter Fenton. He’s a partner at Benchmark, which is a big venture capital fund. I live in San Francisco proper and I was driving back (from Santa Clara) on a terrible commute on 101, and Peter happened to call me during the commute, which was a total weak moment, and said you should come talk to us about Twitter.And I said, I don’t know. This Oracle gig is a pretty good deal. And he said, come meet Jack (Twitter co-creator Jack Dorsey), and tell me what you think. I met Jack over at Square (a mobile-payments company Dorsey runs), actually, and had a couple meetings. And he convinced me to come, basically.What was the selling point? Twitter in its early days had success beyond its means. The site was not super reliable and we weren’t able to serve the customers’ demand. That’s a unique spot for an engineer: People want the product and all you have to do is actually deliver it. If you think you know how to help with that you can show up, contribute to that and it’s very likely going to be a successful outcome. That’s a spot that has the engineers’ names written on it: Come and do this and the company will be successful. If you do your job well then the whole product will be successful, that’s basically the recruiting pitch that we use.Twitter has this fascination in the general public. What is life like there?Right now we have a lot of mystique. Which is great. It’s great for recruiting. It’s great for brand awareness. But the reality of a company is largely the same no matter what company it is. We have our ups and downs as a company just like anyone. There’s a lot of work and a lot of stuff that doesn’t work. All of that stuff exists here just like it exists anywhere. The visibility we do have… the downside, honestly… is it induces a fair amount of anxiety when things go wrong here. You know a lot of people will hear about it.But it also has an upside. People feel pretty proud being part of the news cycle, and being part of the information flow. When you see things like Twitter being used in the Turkish protests last summer, or something like that, it’s cool. It’s cool to be part of the news. It certainly is motivating. It’s a responsibility.We’re not on the level of a real public utility, but we’ve kind of come to think of ourselves as something (like) that. We have a responsibility to our users to be fairly reliable, because a lot of people use it for things that are really important to them, large and small.You may have seen it, across the river from us in Vancouver, a woman live-Tweeted a fatal car wreck that turned out to involve her husband.That was a tragic story. Oh my God! On one level, it’s interesting that she has this outlet. I hope it was useful to her. But on the other hand it’s just a really tragic story. I can’t imagine being in her shoes.You and I first connected on Twitter. How do you use it?For most folks you want to have some mix of professional things and other things to make it an interesting Twitter account. It’s basically what I follow as well, is people that I think have interesting taste and tweet interesting things that I want to read about.I try to keep the number that I follow at 140, which is a little mirror of Twitter’s 140-character limit. I prune it often so that I’m at 140. It reflects what I’m interested in, what I think is interesting, old friends of course.The reason I keep a ceiling on it is, just by my nature what I want in my stream is a modest amount of high-quality content. The companies that have endured from the last tech boom, the Googles or the Amazons, have grown to become much more than they were in the dot-com era. Do you think the same thing might apply to the current tech boom? What kind of company might Twitter be five or 10 years from now?I’m sure you’re aware that we recently purchased a company called Vine (Vine enables short online videos, often embedded in Tweets, that repeat continuously). I think we’re really pleased with the adoption of that. It serves much of a similar use case to Twitter, for people who need to be connected, want to be able to express yourself, want to be able to find out some information. I think Vine skews a little bit more toward entertainment and not toward news. One of the things about consumer Internet, unlike enterprise, is that rather than having a long planning cycle companies tend to have a fast iteration cycle. So projecting the future out five years is not the way we think about it here, internally. We think about it in terms of trying things and trying to put more fuel on the fire of things that are working. We do have a few core values that we use to filter opportunities that come along. One is: Reach every person on the planet. Technology can really be a force of good on Earth, which sounds kind of corny, I know, but we actually do believe it. So one of the things that drives us is expanding our reach across the world. Another core value is to grow our business in a way that makes us proud, by which we mean: Don’t do anything that you don’t want to tell your friends about, or you don’t want to tell your mom about. So we’ve tried to be really diligent in the way we’ve added advertising to the product. I think we’ve done a good job in blending that in a way that doesn’t impact the customer experience negatively. Indeed, some of our ads have higher engagement than our organic material.We have those as our constitution, so to speak, and then are iterative from there.You met your wife at Willamette University. What else do you take away from there?Willamette was an important stepping-stone for me in the following way. When you grow up in a small town you’re not really sure if it’s possible for you to go beyond that. You’re not sure if you’re going to go out in the real world and not going to have what it takes.When I got there I said: I know I’m from one of the smaller (high) schools here and I’m doing just fine. This is working just fine. Beyond what you learn, there’s this confidence-building part of that experience. That’s probably equally important. You start to think about: You can actually make things happen in the world rather than just be part of things that are already happening.We have this young, aspirational tech community in Portland. What advice do you have for them?For good or ill, the whole Portland gestalt encourages lifestyle businesses. It seems to me, sometimes, that people here are starting technology hardware stores, the digital equivalent of the neighborhood hardware store. They’re not all trying to start a metaphorical Home Depot.That’s a perfect analogy. You start a hardware store, you might make a great living. But it’s not going to be a giant company. On the one hand, that guy’s probably really happy and has a great life and goes skiing every weekend and it’s awesome, right? Should he do something else? I don’t know.You’ve got to make your own call on where you want to be on that axis and there are sacrifices either way. If you want to have a giant company then there’s a lot of sacrifices.People work really hard in the Bay Area. And it’s not like people don’t work hard in Portland. I don’t mean to say that at all.  But the life-work balance is skewed differently here than it is in Portland. Here’s the funniest thing about it: There’s this cognitive dissonance in the Bay Area, where everyone talks about work-life balance and everyone thinks that other people have life-work balance but they find that no one does. We not only don’t have life-work balance, but we’re all in a state of perpetual cognitive dissonance and angst because of that. Whereas in Portland, it is a real thing for a lot of people, and that’s great. I’m not going to tell them to do anything else.Where are you on that axis?I struggle. It’s a struggle every day. Engineers are in general not great at balancing things. We like things to be either this way or that way. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699

It can be a challenge for brands to determine whether particular products will resonate with their audience. This is especially true for retail brands and those seeking to create awareness for individual products. To demonstrate techniques for measuring product discussion, we took a look at Twitter data for the top wireless carriers following Apples announcement of the new iPhone 5s. Measure Product Mentions With Respect to Your Brand In the example below, we compared the percentage of iPhone mentions contained within Verizon Wireless brand mentions.

As part ofthe first class of certified products, Simply Measured would like to congratulate the new additions. Were excited to see some great companies added to this list. The companies, who will be joining Simply Measured in the exclusive program, provide innovative, industry-leading services for businesses on Twitter, and go through a long vetting process before being added to the elite group of Twitter developers. New Products The list of Certified Products now has 30 companies, with a strong focus on International developers for the Class of 2013. 7/11 new additions are from outside the US. As Twitter continues growing outside the US (which only accounts for 27% of Twitters audience), these companies will help create the integration business users need to leverage the massive potential on Twitter.
