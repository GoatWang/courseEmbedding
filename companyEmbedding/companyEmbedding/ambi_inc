But the heatwave of the southern summer of 2015/2016 was something exceptional, damaging fisheries and bringing new species to the island.

Skin Care 
							Roundup
								Which 
								products are the biggest bang for 
							your buck?

								By
							Michelle Klein, 
								SkinCareCop.comFor the past year, we've been 
								asking our readers to submit their favorite 
								products via email, Facebook and Twitter so we 
								could review the top favorites for our annual 
								Skin Care Roundup. We received hundreds of 
								submissions in nearly every category from 
								anti-aging creams to eyeliners. Thanks to our 
								voting process, we were able to narrow down the 
								top three contenders in each category. Our 
								editors then went out and actually purchased 
								these products so we could find the ones that 
								were deserving of our Editor's Choice Award. We 
								tested each product for at least one month and 
								considered every factor such as product 
								effectiveness, customer service and refund 
								policies. What we found was quite shocking - 
								some products were truly miracles in a bottle 
								where as others failed to live up to their 
								manufacturers' claims. This year, we've broken 
								down our Skin Care Roundup into 12 parts.

								 






Part 8:
Fade Creams

Fade creams have been around for decades, but these days more and more people are finding uses for these products to help with common skin conditions like age spots, acne scars and melasma. In the past, it was difficult to find high quality products and most manufacturers were using low grade hydroquinone in their formulas. Hydroquinone is known to reduce hyperpigmentation, but there are also many concerns regarding its safety. Fortunately, in the past few years, more natural alternatives have started to come up and its now very easy to find high quality products from reputable brands. While we appreciate the industry's push towards natural ingredients, it's becoming more and more difficult to deceiver which ingredients actually work and which products live up to their claims. Some of the skin lightening ingredients we preferred were natural extracts such as arbutin, kojic acid, niacinamide (Vitamin B3) and bearberry. 
								Most of these ingredients are tolerable by 
								majority of skin types and don't have the same 
								side effects of hydroquinone. Skin Care Cop 
								tested over a dozen products and found one 
								worthy of our Editor's Choice award. We also 
								included a few runner-up products that were 
								voted highly by our readers.

Meladerm
by Civant Skin Care
										(civantskincare.com)


  Currently 4.46/512345  Rating:  4.5/5 (20170 votes cast)  Click Stars to Vote! 


We tried numerous products, ranging from high end department store brands down to affordable over the counter creams. 
										While we did find some products that stood out in one or two areas, only Meladerm by Civant Skin Care checked all of the boxes on our list. We considered many factors such as the quality of the finished product and also the customer service track 
										record of the manufacturer. Meladerm by Civant Skin Care excelled in every category and was also voted highly by our readers.

										Meladerm has been on the market for over 10 years, and in that time has established quite a reputation. Despite the long list of glowing reviews on the company's website, what really compelled us to order was the unconditional money back guarantee. A product is only as good as the company behind it - so with this in mind, we sent Civant 
										Skin Care a few email inquiries and 
										fortunately they responded quickly and 
										answered all of our questions with 
										thorough responses. Additionally, we 
										also liked the company's commitment to 
										using safe and natural ingredients as 
										there are many dangerous products out 
										there in the skin lightening market. 


The Bottom Line
Meladerm is one of the most popular 
											skin lighteners on the market today. 
											The formula was effective in our 
											tests and contains a long laundry 
											list of active ingredients. Overall, 
											it appeared that most of Civant Skin 
											Care's customers tend to be 
											satisfied with the product. And for 
											those unfortunate few that don't see 
											noticeable results, the company will 
											offer a refund within 30 days.

Pros

Highly moisturizing
Hydroquinone-free

											types


Cons


Heavy consistency
Sunblock has to be purchased

More expensive than competitors


White 
										Lucent Brightening
										Moisturizing Cream
by Shiseido
										(shiseido.com)


  Currently 4.05/512345  Rating:  4.1/5 (15002 votes cast)  Click Stars to Vote! 


Shiseido is a Japanese company 
										and probably one of the oldest skin care 
										companies out there. White Lucent 
										consists of several products and 
										replaced the popular UV White skincare 
										line. We did not test every product in 
										the White Lucent line but rather focused 
										on the Brightening Moisturizing Cream 
										since this is the one that really 
										targets hyperpigmentation and was 
										popular with our readers. 

										The White Lucent Brightening 
										Moisturizing Cream consists of mostly 
										natural extracts and was very well 
										suited for individuals with sensitive 
										skin types. While the cream has a rich 
										feel, it goes on smoothly and almost 
										provides a calming sensation to the 
										skin. The Shiseido company is known for 
										extremely high quality products so this 
										one is no exception. It is easy to order 
										online or through many big retailers 
										like Sephora and Macy's. The Bottom Line
While Lucent is one of the best 
											selling product lines in Japan where 
											skin lightening products are always 
											in high demand. Shiseido is well 
											known and reputable company known 
											for luxurious products and luxurious 
											prices. The White Lucent Brightening 
											cream was easily one of the most 
											expensive products in our tests, 
											however it still proved to be very 
											popular with our readers.

Pros
Contains many acids and active 
											skin lightening ingredients
Hydroquinone-free
Penetrates deep into the skin
Small bottle lasts a long time


Cons


Does not come in very large sizes

										separately
Some acids can be aggravating to 
											the skin
Contains alcohol which can be 
											drying


Potent 
										Botanical Skin Brightening
										Gel Complex
by Peter Thomas Roth
										(peterthomasroth.com)


  Currently 3.89/512345  Rating:  3.9/5 (18757 votes cast)  Click Stars to Vote! 


The Peter Thomas Roth brand 
										consists of over 100 products that 
										target everything from acne to wrinkles. 
										The company was launched in the early 
										90s and has gained a lot of popularity 
										in the past few years. The brand is now 
										sold through many online and retail 
										distributors. We really like 
										gels when it comes to skin lightening 
										products. The benefits of a gel is that 
										it goes on much lighter than a cream and 
										can often penetrate further into the 
										skin. The Potent Botanical Skin 
										Brightening Gel Complex not only has a 
										very long name, but also a long list of 
										active ingredients. Many of these 
										actives are acids such as salicylic and 
										azelaic which not only help with 
										hyperpigmentation, but also with 
										exfoliation of dead skin. The downside 
										to acids is that sometimes they can be a 
										bit irritating, especially on those with 
										very sensitive skin types. The Bottom Line
The Potent Botanical Skin 
											Brightening Gel Complex is a strong 
											formula that consists of various 
											acids and natural skin lightening 
											ingredients. The formula penetrates 
											well and helps with exfoliation, 
											however it can also be drying and 
											irritating to the skin for some 
											individuals. The bottle comes in a 
											2.0 oz size which lasts a very long 
											time since only a small amount is 
											needed per application.

Pros
One of the strongest formulas 
											available for stubborn 
											hyperpigmentation
Penetrates deep into the skin


Cons


Uses hydroquionone which can 
											cause side effects
Can be too strong for sensitive 
											skin types
Fairly expensive for a small 
											bottle
Has to be purchased and used 
											under a doctor's supervision



										Nu Derm Clear Fx Skin Brightening Cream
by Obagi
										(obagi.com)


  Currently 3.69/512345  Rating:  3.7/5 (11071 votes cast)  Click Stars to Vote! 


Obagi is a company that needs no 
										introduction. The brand has been 
										extremely popular with doctors and 
										estheticians and is typically only sold 
										through professionals. The reason for 
										this is that the Obagi products contain 
										higher concentrations of active 
										ingredients than most over-the-counter 
										brands. Some of the products in the 
										Obagi line also use prescription 
										ingredients which require the guidance 
										of a professional. Nu Derm Clear 
										uses hydroquinone as its active 
										ingredient. Typically we like to see 
										natural alternatives, but in some cases 
										hydroquinone can be effective for really 
										stubborn pigmentation. Because 
										hydroquinone has some associated side 
										effects, it is highly advised to use it 
										only under the care of a doctor. We 
										found that the Nu Derm Clear was 
										effective in treating really deep 
										pigmentation, but many users also found 
										the formula to be a bit harsh on their 
										skin. The Bottom Line
Nu Derm Clear is part of the Obagi 
											Nu Derm System which comes with 
											additional products to help with 
											hyperpigmentation. Because Nu Derm 
											Clear uses hydroquinone, it is 
											recommended for pigmentation that 
											doesn't respond to natural 
											ingredients like arbutin and kojic 
											acid. We would suggest trying Nu 
											Derm if you have had zero luck with 
											other products and if you are under 
											the supervision of a doctor.

Pros

											daily use


Cons

											show results



										Discoloration Reversal Moisturizer
by DDF
										(ddfskincare.com)


  Currently 3.50/512345  Rating:  3.5/5 (17479 votes cast)  Click Stars to Vote! 


DDF makes some really high 
										quality products for nearly every skin 
										problem you can imagine. The brand was 
										developed under the guidance of 
										dermatologists and has established 
										itself as a leader in the skin care 
										industry. One of the things we liked the 
										most about DDF was the dedication to 
										great customer service. We found their 
										online chat representatives to be 
										extremely helpful and the customer 
										policies to be very fair. The 
										Discoloration Reversal Moisturizer is 
										one of four products in the DDF 
										Hyperpigmentation line. The moisturizer 
										uses natural ingredients such as 
										niacinamide (another name for Vitamin 
										B3) and various plant extracts to help 
										target pigmentation in the skin. We 
										found the formula to be extremely gentle 
										and suitable for every day use. It comes 
										in a nice metallic dispenser which 
										protects the product from light and air 
										contamination. Though we did like the 
										way the product felt on the skin, we 
										didn't see any significant changes in 
										the first 3 weeks of use. This product 
										may be suitable for individuals that 
										have very sensitive skin and can not 
										tolerate stronger products. The Bottom Line
The Discoloration Reversal 
											Moisturizer is a very gentle cream 
											that can be applied daily without 
											any adverse effects. However, due to 
											it's gentle nature, it may also take 
											longer to see significant results. 
											It may also be necessary to use the 
											other products in the 
											Hyperpigmentation line to improve 
											overall performance. We would 
											recommend this product to 
											individuals with very sensitive 
											skin.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
