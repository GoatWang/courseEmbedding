We are a leading manufacturer of both specialty, performance-based products that serve a variety of end markets, and high-quality papers used to convey and enhance image through unique colors and textures.










CEO's Message
Our job is to build on our historical success by following a well-defined, winning strategic course of action. Our strategies are informed by a clear vision: to create value by improving the image and performance of everything we touch. That vision is the basis for our internal employee culture and our external market leadership. Looking towards the future, we expect to continue to improve the organic growth rate of the company by investing in Technical Products categories, while reinventing our profitable Fine Paper business with growth in Premium Packaging. Success means that we will execute strategic initiatives that profitably grow the top line, reinforce competitive capabilities, and relentlessly optimize our cost structure, all with the goal of increasing shareholder value.
John P. O’Donnell President and Chief Executive Officer














Leading in profitable, specialty niche markets


We will increase our participation in niche markets that can provide us with leading positions and value our core competencies in performance-based fiber and non-woven media production, coating and saturating. Key markets include transportation filtration media, specialty backings, and premium fine paper and packaging.
            





Increasing our size, growth rate and portfolio diversification 


We will invest and focus resources in higher growth technical/specialty markets to grow with customers in new geographies, and to enter into adjacent markets that are growing and profitable. We will do this both through organic initiatives that build on our technologies and capabilities, and through acquisitions that fit with our competencies and provide attractive financial returns.
            





Delivering consistent, attractive returns to our shareholders


We will continue to use Return on Invested Capital as a key metric to evaluate investment decisions and measure our performance, while maintaining a prudent capital structure and deploying cash flows in ways that provide value, including returning a portion of cash directly to shareholders through a meaningful dividend.

                        NEENAH® Performance Materials has over 60 years of experience in the manufacturing of latex-saturated and coated papers used in abrasive backings products worldwide. With an established track record for quality and performance, we are the preferred choice for backing systems used in waterproof and dry sanding applications.

Dry Finishing
Balanced Features for Outstanding Results
NEENAH® Abrasive Backings for Dry Finishing Applications provide the right balance of strength, flexibility, and tear resistance needed for tough jobs, including wood, automotive, marine, furniture and metal sanding.
Unlike many conventional kraft papers found at retail stores, NEENAH® Dry Finishing Abrasive Backings are latex saturated and coated for excellent flexibility, durability, surface receptivity, and end-product performance. NEENAH® Dry Finishing Papers also contain barrier coatings designed for use with common water-based make coatings, such as animal-hide glue. These tough barrier coatings help improve grain adhesion and maintain full flexibility of the base by preventing make coat penetration which can cause brittleness. Barrier coatings can also help improve the adhesion and resistance to penetration of non-glue make coat systems, such as the UF, PF and epoxy-based systems used in dry finishing applications.

		Wet Sanding
	



Wet Sanding
Waterproof Papers: Long Life Adds More Value 
NEENAH® Performance Materials Waterproof Backing Systems are designed for traditional wet sanding applications such as automotive repair, general metal sanding and oil sanding of wood. All are engineered to provide flexibility, durability, toughness, and smoothness. This unique balance of properties helps assure that the backing life exceeds that of the customer-applied grit, even after prolonged periods of immersion in water. NEENAH® Performance Materials offers backings with extreme smoothness allowing for application of fine grits for paint and polishing applications. NEENAH® Wet Sanding Abrasive Backings have specially designed barrier coatings for superior holdout and adhesion to make and size coatings. Barrier coatings can be formulated to be compatible with water or solvent-based make coatings. And because many make and size coatings involve highly complex chemistries, custom barrier coating formulations can be designed to enhance the barrier coating interaction with your systems.
NEENAH® Performance Materials Backsize Coatings enhance the functional performance of the finished coated abrasive. These specialty coatings provide added curl resistance, increased water resistance and improved grip during hand sanding applications.

CLASSIC CREST® Papers are also part of the Genuine Private Watermark and CUSTOMARK® Programs. Just like creating a genuine watermark, CUSTOMARK® allows for smaller “custom” quantities. 
Completely Sustainable

Printing Tips
Following these suggestions will help you achieve maximum performance on CLASSIC CREST® Papers by Neenah. It is recommended to pretest all production procedures prior to press time to ensure the desired results are achieved. Sample sheets can be ordered on our website or are available through authorized Neenah distributors.

Neenah Paper: Well Positioned In A Niche Premium Market - Neenah Paper, Inc. (NYSE:NP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Neenah Paper: Well Positioned In A Niche Premium MarketJul.19.17 | About: Neenah Paper, (NP) Dustin Barnett Value, long onlySummaryNeenah Paper, Inc.'s recent $0.08 share decrease in EPS explained.The new Accounting Standards Update's impact on the rest of the year's earnings.Neenah's competitive position in the market.Forward projections through the second half of 2018.Neenah Paper, Inc.'s (NYSE:NP) focus is on a premium market. The company's two operating segments are technical products and fine paper and packaging. Technical products include advanced filtration media, specialized performance substrates and label and tag products. The fine paper and packaging segment provides specialty paper through many refreshed trademarked brands. The company operates in eighty countries with manufacturing headquarters in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Neenah Paper has proven its ability to combat digital headwinds in the paper industry in recent years. The company has grown from a $3.02 share price in March 2009 to around a $79.00 share price to date. The company's entire focus is on a premium paper market, which is the driving factor in Neenah's success. Despite Neenah Paper's increasing input cost and recent tax adjustment, I predict a slight increase in share price throughout the year with a spike in the later half of 2018. Recent Earnings Neenah Paper continues to impress despite the many challenges in the first half of 2017. The $0.08 a share decrease in EPS compared to a year ago was a direct result of a reduction in operating income. The $6.7 million decrease in operating income was driven by four factors: Appleton's filtration startup cost ($3 million), downtime cost from the German facility ($2 million), currency fluctuation and increased material cost ($2 million). Neenah's recent Appleton Mill expansion project added an onsite saturating facility. The new expansion is expected to free up capacity in Germany and better supply the market demand for Neenah products. The project has a break-even utilization rate of around 30% and expected to become profitable in the later half of 2018.
 Another impact to Neenah's first quarter earnings was the week downtime in the German facility. Although this negatively impacted operating income by $2 million, this proactive step will increase safety and decrease the potential combustion risk. The $2 million cost for currency fluctuation and increased material cost are two negative factors that could occur periodically in Neenah Paper's financials. For example, this quarter experienced a double-digit price increase in latex, the most prevalent raw material used in the technical products segment. Although the company adjusts for fluctuating input costs, the final adjustment normally lags by two quarters. Overall, input costs are expected to rise throughout the year. A sudden increase in cost is no new challenge for Neenah. Neenah will find improvement measures and change prices to overcome this challenge. Tax Rate Adjustment A big concern I have for Neenah Paper is the fluctuating tax rate. In 2016, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update, which amends stock-based compensation. The new standard will have significant changes to net income and earnings per share and is difficult to predict. Neenah experienced a book tax rate of 26% in the first quarter this year compared to 33% a year ago. This tax rate is desired but cannot be sustained. The company expects an estimated rate of 32% for 2017. In order for this to be achieved, the remaining 3 quarters will see around a 35% tax rate. To give reference, the company had a yearly tax rate of 29% in 2016. Competitive Positioning Neenah Paper is competitively positioned by attracting a premium niche market opposed to mass production of everyday consumer based products. Large pulp based manufacturing companies such as International Paper (NYSE:IP) and WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) perform in a more volatile paper market. Brand equity along with a technological barrier create a low threat of new entry in Neenah's Fine Paper segment. Neenah's advanced assets have the ability to produce high technical quality on a small run basis.
 On the Technical segment side, pricing is the determining factor for a company to get knocked out of the market. The company has experienced an overall increase of sales around 2% in this segment compared to a year ago. The demand for technical products continues to increase, mostly in the transportation filtration market. Neenah's transportation filtration segment sells to automotive companies primarily in Europe. The growing automotive market in Europe will increase demand for Neenah's transportation filtration products. Europe's automotive sales rose 8% in May 2017. According to the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA), "In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry." The main reason Neenah has not been able to capitalize in this market is the high capacity of the Germany facility. The Appleton expansion will allow the German facility to direct its focus to this market. Neenah is expanding in order to supply customer demand. This gives great promise in the company's continued linear growth and long-term survival of the company. Forward Projections Neenah Paper's relatively low market capitalization of $1.3 billion suggests the company may have great growth opportunity. Neenah's management team continues to position the company for future growth through both acquisitions and double-digit return projects. Neenah has a high return of equity and return of asset ratio of 21.0 and 9.1 compared to an industry average of 9.7 and 4.9 respectively. Neenah's forward P/E ratio is 16.89 compared to an industry's expected forward P/E ratio of 14.49. Neenah Paper is worth this higher P/E ratio based on the attributes that differentiate the company from others in the paper industry. The growing dividend of around a 2% yield coupled with an aggressive share repurchase program will help offset the higher material cost and increased tax rate. Neenah announced the renewal of the $25 million outstanding common stock repurchase program that is expected to continue until May 2018. This program demonstrates Neenah's strong financial positioning in the market and the company's confidence in its future prospects.
 The $25 million common stock repurchase program is 1.92% of the company's overall market capitalization, which is currently $1.3 billion. The exact number of repurchased shares is difficult to predict based on the periodic buyback at a fluctuating share rate. Although an exact calculation cannot be determined, the large buyback will certainly grow earnings substantially faster than the company's operating improvements alone. Shareholders are being rewarded by constant dividend growth (representing a current payoff) while in a share repurchase phase (representing a long term capital gain). Annual dividend payments are now around $25 million resulting in a dividend yield slightly over 2%. In first quarter gains, $13 million was split evenly between both dividend payments and the share repurchase program. Overall, Neenah Paper's unique positioning in a niche premium market differentiates them from a mass-producing paper manufacturer. The company has proven its ability to greatly reward shareholders both through an increasing dividend and an aggressive share repurchase program. The company's Appleton project will increase the Technical segment's earnings in the later half of 2018. This project will better balance the company's successful Fine Paper and Package segment. Expect a slight increase in share price for the remainder of the year, mainly caused by the lag time from higher input costs and an increased tax rate. I predict a share spike in the later half of 2018 from the concluding share repurchase program and a net income generation from the Appleton project.

Neenah Paper: Well Positioned In A Niche Premium Market - Neenah Paper, Inc. (NYSE:NP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Neenah Paper: Well Positioned In A Niche Premium MarketJul.19.17 | About: Neenah Paper, (NP) Dustin Barnett Value, long onlySummaryNeenah Paper, Inc.'s recent $0.08 share decrease in EPS explained.The new Accounting Standards Update's impact on the rest of the year's earnings.Neenah's competitive position in the market.Forward projections through the second half of 2018.Neenah Paper, Inc.'s (NYSE:NP) focus is on a premium market. The company's two operating segments are technical products and fine paper and packaging. Technical products include advanced filtration media, specialized performance substrates and label and tag products. The fine paper and packaging segment provides specialty paper through many refreshed trademarked brands. The company operates in eighty countries with manufacturing headquarters in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Neenah Paper has proven its ability to combat digital headwinds in the paper industry in recent years. The company has grown from a $3.02 share price in March 2009 to around a $79.00 share price to date. The company's entire focus is on a premium paper market, which is the driving factor in Neenah's success. Despite Neenah Paper's increasing input cost and recent tax adjustment, I predict a slight increase in share price throughout the year with a spike in the later half of 2018. Recent Earnings Neenah Paper continues to impress despite the many challenges in the first half of 2017. The $0.08 a share decrease in EPS compared to a year ago was a direct result of a reduction in operating income. The $6.7 million decrease in operating income was driven by four factors: Appleton's filtration startup cost ($3 million), downtime cost from the German facility ($2 million), currency fluctuation and increased material cost ($2 million). Neenah's recent Appleton Mill expansion project added an onsite saturating facility. The new expansion is expected to free up capacity in Germany and better supply the market demand for Neenah products. The project has a break-even utilization rate of around 30% and expected to become profitable in the later half of 2018.
 Another impact to Neenah's first quarter earnings was the week downtime in the German facility. Although this negatively impacted operating income by $2 million, this proactive step will increase safety and decrease the potential combustion risk. The $2 million cost for currency fluctuation and increased material cost are two negative factors that could occur periodically in Neenah Paper's financials. For example, this quarter experienced a double-digit price increase in latex, the most prevalent raw material used in the technical products segment. Although the company adjusts for fluctuating input costs, the final adjustment normally lags by two quarters. Overall, input costs are expected to rise throughout the year. A sudden increase in cost is no new challenge for Neenah. Neenah will find improvement measures and change prices to overcome this challenge. Tax Rate Adjustment A big concern I have for Neenah Paper is the fluctuating tax rate. In 2016, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update, which amends stock-based compensation. The new standard will have significant changes to net income and earnings per share and is difficult to predict. Neenah experienced a book tax rate of 26% in the first quarter this year compared to 33% a year ago. This tax rate is desired but cannot be sustained. The company expects an estimated rate of 32% for 2017. In order for this to be achieved, the remaining 3 quarters will see around a 35% tax rate. To give reference, the company had a yearly tax rate of 29% in 2016. Competitive Positioning Neenah Paper is competitively positioned by attracting a premium niche market opposed to mass production of everyday consumer based products. Large pulp based manufacturing companies such as International Paper (NYSE:IP) and WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) perform in a more volatile paper market. Brand equity along with a technological barrier create a low threat of new entry in Neenah's Fine Paper segment. Neenah's advanced assets have the ability to produce high technical quality on a small run basis.
 On the Technical segment side, pricing is the determining factor for a company to get knocked out of the market. The company has experienced an overall increase of sales around 2% in this segment compared to a year ago. The demand for technical products continues to increase, mostly in the transportation filtration market. Neenah's transportation filtration segment sells to automotive companies primarily in Europe. The growing automotive market in Europe will increase demand for Neenah's transportation filtration products. Europe's automotive sales rose 8% in May 2017.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
