                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch's ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool, available 
      credit enhancement, Chase Bank USA's underwriting and servicing 
      capabilities, and the transaction's legal and cash flow structures, 
      which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      The transaction structure is the same as class A(2015-7), with credit 
      enhancement totalling 14% for class A.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults, 2) a 
      reduction in monthly payment rate (MPR), and 3) a combination stress of 
      higher defaults and lower MPR.
    

      Increasing defaults alone has no impact on rating migration even in the 
      most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating 
      sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate is more pronounced with a 
      moderate stress, of a 75% reduction, leading to possible downgrades 
      across all classes. The harshest scenario assumes that an increase in 
      defaults and reduction in MPR occur simultaneously. Similarly, the 
      ratings would only be downgraded under the severe stress of 75% increase 
      in defaults and 35% reduction in MPR.
    

      To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all 
      performance metrics within Fitch's initial expectations. For further 
      discussion of our sensitivity analysis, please see the related presale 
      report. For a discussion of the representations, warranties, and 
      enforcement mechanisms available to investors in this transaction please 
      see the related presale appendix.
