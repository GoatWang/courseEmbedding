               Company: Centria Company
Job Details
               Now more than ever, CENTRIA's dedicated, motivated and imaginative employees are exploring entirely new wall and roof systems for the next 100 years and beyond. They combine their expertise to meet the aesthetic and functional challenges facing building owners, architects, engineers and contractors today. "We are very excited to celebrate our 100-year anniversary, to look back on our previous successes, and also begin to focus on new products and ideas for the future," says Rick Brow, director of marketing for CENTRIA Architectural Systems. "In our next 100 years, we want to develop more environmentally friendly products, build more efficient buildings, and continue to provide designs and materials developed to meet the ever-changing needs of the industry." Recognizing the importance of environmentally responsible building, CENTRIA product design focuses on energy-efficiency, sustainable design and the use of recyclable materials. In late 2005, CENTRIA began the application process for Cradle to Cradle certification for its Formawall Dimension Series® insulated metal composite panel. Cradle to Cradle status is awarded to products made from materials, and manufactured by processes, that meet a set of standards founded on the principle of materials being perpetually circulated in closed loops. Formawall Dimension Series panels met the criteria, making CENTRIA the first building products company awarded a Silver Cradle to Cradle product certification. CENTRIA will continue to develop environmentally friendly solutions and obtain independent sustainable product audits to continue their leadership in this area. CENTRIA has also responded to the need for better thermal and moisture control with their Advanced Thermal Moisture Protection solutions. ATMP focuses on the use of single component wall systems and Insulated Composite Back-up Panel (ICBP) solutions that reduce the number of materials used and trades involved and result in higher thermal efficiency. Formawall Dimension Series insulated metal composite panels is one solution that offers a complete, thermally efficient, high performance exterior wall that can be installed quickly and economically. The panel's horizontal joint is pressure-equalized and provides uninterrupted air, water and vapor barriers.  H.H. Robertson, formed in 1906, the E.G. Smith company, 1935, and Steelite, 1958, all merged their engineering, fabrication and construction capabilities in 1996 to form CENTRIA - the singular, new leader in exterior metal architectural systems.  As the future requires advancements in wall and roof system design and technology to meet the increasing demands of architects, owners, and contractors for better materials, value, performance and longer life cycles, CENTRIA stands ready to provide solutions. Upcoming projects include fresh, new aesthetics in metal architecture, sustainable design attributes, improved thermal efficiency for reduced energy costs, superior moisture protection to stop moisture intrusion and entrapment and new services to simplify design, expedite delivery and improve in-place quality. Based in Moon Township, near Pittsburgh, CENTRIA is an international company and the nation's premier supplier of architectural metal wall and roof systems used in industrial and commercial projects. Since 1906, CENTRIA professionals have provided quality products and service for architectural and construction firms worldwide.
