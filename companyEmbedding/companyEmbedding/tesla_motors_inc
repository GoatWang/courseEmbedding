Tesla Motors, Inc. to Unveil Product Next Week
What will Tesla announce?

Electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans to host a "product unveiling" on Oct. 17, CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter over the weekend. Exactly what the new product will be is unknown, but previous comments from management offer some suggestions.
Here's what there is to know ahead of Tesla's event on Monday.
What it won't be
"Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most)," Musk tweeted on Sunday. The cryptic language was enough to prompt speculation while simultaneously leaving investors pretty much clueless. (Thanks a lot, Elon.)
Fortunately, Musk did rule out one announcement when he tweeted that the event would be "followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th." This statement referenced a previous tweet in September noting the company was "aiming" to reveal its new solar roof, with an integrated second-generation energy storage product and a "Tesla charger," on Oct. 28. It's not clear whether this Oct. 28 product announcement is contingent on the closing of its acquisition attempt of solar panel company SolarCity -- a deal Tesla hopes to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. But it looks like Tesla is continuing to plan on the event even as the two companies remain separate.





So Tesla's Oct. 17 announcement likely won't be related to energy storage or SolarCity's upcoming solar-roof product.
What it might be
Besides Tesla's promised next-generation energy storage products, there are two pending events management has previously said it would hold in the near future: a "part 2" demonstration of its Model 3, and a more advanced version of Autopilot. Could the unveiling have to do with either of these upcoming announcements?
Just before Tesla first unveiled its Model 3 design on March 31, Musk said the event was just "Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be close to production."

Since Model 3 deliveries aren't expected to begin until late 2017, a "Part 2" Model 3 unveiling next week is unlikely.
A more likely announcement for October is a next-generation Autopilot system. When Musk was asked at Recode's Code Conference 2016 about whether Model 3 would have autonomous driving capabilities, the CEO said Tesla would host an event later in 2016 to "talk more about that."
Here's an excerpt from Musk's conversation with Recode's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher:

Mossberg: [The Model 3] will have autonomous for $35,000?
Musk: I have a -- I'm going to do another Tesla event, maybe by the end of the year, to talk more about that.
Mossberg: Well, so, you can start here.
Musk: It will be real big news if I start here.
Mossberg: We don't mind that.
Musk: Let me just say that we're going to do the obvious thing.
Mossberg and Swisher: Ok...
Musk: It's really obvious.

Currently, Tesla's Autopilot system puts all the responsibility on the driver, serving as a driver-assist technology. Autopilot automatically steers, brakes, and changes lanes on the highway, but it requires that drivers remain alert, keeping their hands on the wheel and ready to take control if the Autopilot fails to drive correctly.





A more advanced Autopilot system might bring Tesla vehicles closer to full autonomy. As Musk as warned repeatedly, though, regulation will likely lag advancements toward autonomy, so it's unlikely even a more advanced system would readily relieve drivers of their driving responsibilities.
Of course, Tesla could very well announce something totally different from these two products Musk has hinted at.
While next week's announcement, in and of itself, could be enough to impact an investing thesis in the stock, investors should file this as a big "unknown" until it's clear exactly what Tesla is unveiling.

Tesla Powerpack to Enable Large Scale Sustainable Energy to South Australia

        The Tesla Team                    July 6, 2017

Last September, a 50-year storm damaged critical infrastructure in the state of South Australia, causing a state-wide blackout and leaving 1.7 million residents without electricity. Further blackouts occurred in the heat of the Australian summer in early 2017. In response, the South Australian Government as a leader in renewable energy, looked for a sustainable solution to ensure energy security for all residents, now and into the future, calling for expressions of interest to deploy grid-scale energy storage options with at least 100 megawatts (MW) of capacity.

Tesla Model X the First SUV Ever to Achieve 5-Star Crash Rating in Every Category

        The Tesla Team                    June 13, 2017

We engineered Model X to be the safest SUV ever, and today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that after conducting independent testing, it has awarded Model X a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, making it the first SUV ever to earn the 5-star rating across the board. More than just resulting in a 5-star rating, the data from NHTSA’s testing shows that Model X has the lowest probability of injury of any SUV it has ever tested. In fact, of all the cars NHTSA has ever tested, Model X’s overall probability of injury was second only to Model S.

The Next Step in Energy Storage: Aggregation

        The Tesla Team                    May 12, 2017

Today, modern utilities and grid operators are utilizing battery technology like never before. The next step in tapping the potential of energy storage is putting together thousands of batteries to form an energy network that utilities can use to deliver immediate value for the electric system. Tesla can now bundle Powerwall and Powerpack batteries into a single portfolio, also called aggregation, to make the grid cleaner and more efficient. Meanwhile, Powerwall customers who allow Tesla and the utilities to use their battery when energy demand is highest will not only have home backup power, but will also receive compensation for its use on the grid.

Tesla Motors, Inc. Will Announce a "Major New Product Line" in April
Will this be Tesla's "major new product line" that it is unveiling next month?











                Daniel Sparks
            

                (TMFDanielSparks)



            
            Mar 30, 2015 at 3:15PM
            
            





Just about a week after the company's press conference announcing a software update for its Model S fleet, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is announcing another event. On April 30, at 8 p.m. PST, Tesla will introduce a "major new Tesla product line" that is "not a car," Musk said on Twitter Monday morning.

Major new Tesla product line -- not a car -- will be unveiled at our Hawthorne Design Studio on Thurs 8pm, April 30
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 30, 2015
While we can't be certain, the new product line Musk is referring to is probably the company's "home battery" the CEO teased during its fourth-quarter earnings call in February.
"We're going to unveil sort of the Tesla home battery -- consumer battery -- that will be for use in people's houses or businesses, fairly soon," Musk explained. "We have the design done. And it should start going into production probably in about six months or so." 
Musk went on to say that Tesla was trying to figure out a date to have the product unveiling and noted that it will probably be "in the next month or two." The timing of an April 30 announcement coincides with Musk's timeline for a battery unveil.
What would a home battery be for? To get a better understanding of the product's purpose, look to solar company SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), where Musk is Chairman. SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive, Musk's cousin, said last year that the company would eventually sell every home solar system with a battery-storage system. Musk has said that Tesla will supply at least some of the batteries SolarCity will need to offer this service.






SolarCity's DemandLogic energy system pairs solar panels with Tesla batteries. Image source: SolarCity.
Tesla's next frontier Tesla is taking its foray into energy storage seriously. Musk's right-hand man, Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel, who leads Tesla's energy storage and battery efforts, has said that Tesla is as much "an energy innovation company" as it is a car company.

Just how serious of a business does Tesla imagine energy storage to be for the company? The best measurement we have of Tesla's expectations is a comment from Musk that as much as one-third of the Gigafactory's output will be intended for stationary storage. With the company planning to produce 50 gigawatt hours of pack output per year by 2020, therefore, Tesla may be aiming for 16.5 gigawatt hours of this pack output to be used for energy storage -- or four times the watt hour storage used to support Tesla's 2014 vehicle production.
For Tesla's energy storage business to take off, Tesla is betting costs for solar panels and lithium-ion batteries will continue to fall. The lower the costs for solar panels and batteries, the larger Tesla's addressable market for a home battery system.





Of course, it's still not clear that a home battery will actually be the major new Tesla product line unveiled on April 30. But we do know a home battery is coming.

TSLA Stock: Could This Be Tesla Motors Inc’s New Product? 

    By Mukta Samtani Published : October 17, 2016


This Cannot Solve Problems at Tesla Motors
Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock lost about two percent on Friday and closed the session at $196.51, continuing its downward trend.
Then CEO Elon Musk sent a tweet over the weekend that the company’s surprise product now won’t be unveiled until Wednesday, as it needed more refinements. Earlier, he had announced that the unveiling of a new Tesla product would be today (Monday). This does not bode well for TSLA stock or the company’s reputation.
Such developments only reinforce the opinion that Musk is in a hurry to move on to new challenges instead of taking care of the old ones.
The media is full of stories guessing what the new “unexpected” product might be. As per a survey conducted last week, around 40% of people expected it to be “Autopilot 2.0/Tesla Vision” and 20% expected it to be “Tesla Glass”. (Source: “Tesla is about to unveil an ‘unexpected’ product: what do you think it will be? [Poll],” Electrek, October 11, 2016.)
If indeed Autopilot 2.0 is the new product to be unveiled on Wednesday, this is not what the company or TSLA stock needs right now. At a time when many doubt Tesla’s promise to meet its delivery targets, what the company needs to do is fix the production problems at Tesla. As more competitors challenge Tesla with their own electric vehicles, the new product should be one that strengthens Tesla’s lead in this segment.

More Challenges For Tesla’s Autopilot
It was reported on Sunday that German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt asked Tesla to stop advertising its cars as having an “Autopilot” function. The word Autopilot suggests that the car can run on its own without the drivers’ attention, which is misleading to potential buyers. The right term to use would be “driver assistance system.” (Source: “Germany says Tesla should not use ‘Autopilot’ in advertising,” Reuters, October 16, 2016.)
Autopilot has always been under intense scrutiny following Tesla car crashes in different parts of the world. This has had negative impact on TSLA stock. Autopilot function was also the reason that Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) had a falling out with the company. Mobileye was clear that Autopilot was a driver assistance system only, and could not be a driverless system as Tesla was promoting it to be. Meanwhile, Musk wants to convince everyone that Tesla’s Autopilot system is twice as safe as human drivers.
Although the company’s collaboration with Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) for solar energy parts may bear fruit in the future, Tesla’s merger with SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ:SCTY) is yet to go through. This is another example of how Musk is a man in great hurry.
Elon Musk needs to convince investors that the company can meet its production targets and take care of its financial troubles. If this message is not clear, there is not much upside for TSLA stock.

Tesla Stock
Model 3 to Make or Break Tesla Inc in 2017
The year 2016 was when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) started taking steps to transform itself into an energy company. After the acquisition of SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ:SCTY), the company—known then as Tesla Motors Inc—formally changed its name to Tesla Inc, signifying and communicating this change. And so far, it has been good for Tesla stock.
Tesla Inc enters 2017 as the world’s only vertically integrated sustainable energy company that provides end-to-end clean energy products, including generation, storage, and consumption. The company not only sells fully electric vehicles but also installs, operates, and maintains solar and energy storage products. The potential for these energy products has helped buoy TSLA stock in the new year.
The year 2017 may be a make or break year for Tesla Inc, for the simple reason that its highly anticipated electric sedan, the Tesla "Model 3," which is aimed at the mass market, shall hit the roads in the second half. The Tesla stock price has been gyrating to the tunes of Model 3 optimism or pessimism and the situation is likely to continue this year as well.
Moreover, all eyes are also on how strong solar roof demand turns out to be when production starts in the second half of the year, and what the cost advantages will be for customers.
Moreover, the "Gigafactory" has started producing batteries, which would be used for the Tesla "Powerwall" and "Powerpack," as well as the Tesla Model 3. Investors are looking forward to accelerated demand for the company’s energy storage products, which could be a great boost to TSLA stock in 2017.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
