History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

Bringing SSgA’s diversified investment solutions to the Irish market
Back


Paul Dunne, head of business development at State Street Global Advisors Ireland (SSgA), looks at ways that SSgA can deliver its diversified investment solutions to the Irish market by using a wide spectrum of asset classes that will ultimately address its clients long-term investment goals.

6.30 a.m. Is it me - or are we all setting our alarms a little earlier every year to try and beat the traffic? A quick breakfast with my wife sometimes joined by our two young daughters.

7.00 a.m. I depart for the State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) office on Hatch Street, where we relocated to in May 2011 following the acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management by SSgA. It’s a short walk from the car park to the office, giving me an opportunity to check the blackberry and grab a coffee en route. 

7.30 a.m. Having landed at the desk, I check my diary for the day - see what kind of flexibility there is to catch up on some outstanding matters. I respond to emails and then have a quick scan of the newspapers.  There is much coverage of the ECB’s surprising decision to cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent.  SSgA is one of the world’s leading cash and short duration fixed income managers. With official rates anchored at such low levels, our extensive range of strategies is proving popular with clients; we find that many investors are increasingly looking to outsource cash management, and the associated credit risk, to specialist managers such as SSgA.

8.30 a.m. I spend the next thirty minutes working on presentation material for an upcoming new business pitch. Since the Pensions Board set its end-June deadline for submission of funding proposals for defined benefit pension schemes, we have seen an increase in scheme activity levels. This has accelerated since the deadline passed as next steps are considered for the de-risking of their scheme assets.

9.00 a.m. I dial into an internal company conference call. We have just completed a complex investment restructure for a key client in conjunction with our colleagues in State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Limited who provide administration and custody services for a number of SSgA’s clients. The purpose of this morning’s call is to address any open action items and to discuss progress towards the impending year-end audit.

10.00 a.m. I make a number of follow-up calls to clients, investment consultants and colleagues, which often alters my agenda for the day.  One call is with SSgA’s new Head of European Consultant Relations, Helen Copinger-Symes. Based in London, Helen wants an update from SSgA’s European locations on their specific market dynamics in order to build a high-level perspective on each region. It is always useful to hear the views of colleagues throughout this global organisation, and while each office has unique requirements, there are more similarities than differences. Such calls ultimately help us to improve local service offerings.

11.00 a.m. The Marketing, Relationship Management and Distribution Teams meet to discuss upcoming client information events. The most imminent is a breakfast event for about 30 of our current and prospective clients, to be held in our offices later this month.  SSgA’s Chief Investment Officers for Real Estate, Fundamental Equity and Absolute Return strategies will present to investors seeking enhanced return and diversification opportunities. We target around ten of these events annually, regularly using external facilities for larger events in Dublin and Cork. 

12.00 p.m. Lunch is with an international asset manager client that uses the SSgA SPDR range of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). They use SSgA SPDR ETFs to complement some of their own investment strategies and to close out specific sectoral exposures.  The ETF market in Europe is growing significantly. SPDR has a reputation as an industry innovator, having introduced many ground-breaking products. SSgA manages the two largest ETFs globally, and our SPDR S&P US DIVIDEND ARISTOCRAT UCITS ETF is the largest dividend-paying ETF in Europe.

1.30 p.m. I cut through Iveagh Gardens on the way back to the desk. Our office overlooks this park, which is something of a hidden gem, a little oasis of calm in the centre of the city. Back at work, I catch up with my Marketing colleagues to discuss our annual Pensions & Investment Conference to be held in February 2014. This is our flagship event, providing us with an opportunity to draw on SSgA’s investment experts to share their insights on trends within our industry. We find many of them are very happy to travel to Dublin! Today, we try to put structure around the topics/themes that we believe will be most interesting and relevant to our attendees.

2:30 p.m. I have a lengthy meeting with our Client Relationship Management team. We are in planning mode for 2014 and spend the next two hours segmenting the market into the varying categories (Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution etc) and sharing thoughts and ideas on the challenges and opportunities that the coming year may present for each segment. These sessions are very worthwhile, and stimulate new ideas and thinking. Often, a key takeaway from these sessions is to initiate discussions with our European Product team to structure products that our clients need to meet their long-term investment goals.

4.30 p.m. I’m out of the office again to meet with one of the investment consulting firms. This is a follow-up on a recent meeting where we discussed SSgA’s alternative investment arm - SSARIS. It’s been a very successful year for the SSARIS Multi-Strategy Program that was launched in February this year in a Qualified Investor Fund (QIF) format. Performance has been strong and it meets the needs of investors who are looking for a strategy that aims to generate consistent absolute returns in any environment.

5.30 p.m. I catch up on e-mails from the day and try to finish off my ‘to do’ list compiled this morning. Does anyone actually achieve this anymore? Anything that needs to be addressed immediately is done and anything that can be completed the next morning is filed accordingly. I then catch up on my voicemails and return calls as required.

6.30 p.m. I tend to use the end of the work day to keep myself informed of general investment market trends and have a look at the performance of some of our active strategies. The SSgA website also has a great store of Thought Leadership articles, and I spend the next half hour reading significant pieces that have caught my eye.  Today, I read Chris Probyn’s (SSgA’s Chief Economist) ‘Forecasts’ document, which provides an economic and financial market outlook as we enter the final stretch of 2013 and consider what 2014 might hold.
I try to leave the office before 19:00 to get home before the kids go to bed.
