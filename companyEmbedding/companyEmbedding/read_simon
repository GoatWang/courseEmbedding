Article Reviews



If you have ever watched a magician on TV or been to a magic show, chances are that you have seen some amazing magic tricks. You might have seen the Statue of Liberty apparently made to Simon Miller X Rebecca Pinto Radius Stud Earrings disappear, a magician take to the air seemingly able to fly, or that old favorite, the magician's assistant apparently being sawn in half. We all know that Simon Miller X Rebecca Pinto Radius Stud Earrings these feats are just illusions, tricks, since New York landmarks don't really disappear, people don't really fly, and a person sawn into two halves can't be joined back together again - but that does not lessen our enjoyment one iota. If anything, knowing something is a trick actually adds to our enjoyment - because we find ourselves asking how was such a convincing illusion achieved.Other interesting aspect of magic, is that while spectacular tricks can grab newspaper headlines, even more mundane tricks with ordinary props (or no props at all), can still fascinate us. If you have ever seen a well executed card trick, or a magician make a small object disappear, you may find useful just as fascinated and intrigued as by the spectacular tricks that you see on TV.If you know a few magic tricks, you can also use them to fascinate your friends and family. A simple trick can liven Simon Miller X Rebecca Pinto Radius Stud Earrings up a family event or party, and if you are so inclined you could even use magic tricks to impress your friends in bars and perhaps even get a free drink or two. If you want to learn magic tricks, the Internet can be a lot of help, as there are some excellent web sites about the subject.

            Containing 18 Bible stories (reprints of separately published, slim early reader books), the text is in large type and features short sentences. Each story is told in 25 words or less. The illustrations are large and engaging. At the beginning of each story, a word list is offered, as is educational advice to parents from the author.The Bible stories included are: Creation, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, baby Moses, Jericho, David and Goliath, Jonah and the big fish, the birth of John the Baptist, the first Christmas, Jesus feeding the crowd, the Good Samaritan, Mary and Martha, Jesus blessing the children, Zacchaeus, Jesus entering Jerusalem, the first Easter, and Jesus filling the nets. What I Like: My 5 year old was really excited to have a Bible she can read herself. This is an attractive book, with plenty of interesting, cartoonish illustrations. The text is ideal for beginning readers. Most kids will find some words challenging, but plenty of easier words are included, too.What I Dislike: I really only have two small complaints about this book. One pops up during the story of David and Goliath. Instead of saying King Saul offered David his armor, the author writes that a "soldier"offered his armor. My only other complaint is the way the book ends. Although we never learn why Jesus died and was put on the cross, we do learn about his ressurrection. Then, the last story in the book is about Jesus telling the diciples where to fill their nets. This seems like such a weird way to end the book. Did Jesus come alive again just to tell his friends where to fish?That said, this book clearly isn't meant to replace a child's "read-to-me" Bible. Although this book covers a lot of famous Bible stories, the text is necessarily limited. Think of this as a supplemental Bible designed to give your kids their first experiences in reading the Word every day.Overall Rating: Very Good.Kristina SeleshankoChristian Children's Book Review

Product Description
Alan Vanneman extends the boundaries of the Sherlock Holmes canon in this crafty new novel featuring the world’s greatest literary detective. A late-night summons takes Holmes and Dr. Watson from the cozy Victorian comforts of Baker Street on to the Orient Express, where they travel the breadth of Europe to exotic Constantinople. But danger’s afoot, for death, too, is traveling first class. As Holmes strives to unmask his most cunning, ruthless, and elusive foe, he is transported into a world of high finance rife with intrigue and crime. With a cast of characters that includes historical greats like Winston Churchill as well as a beggar girl whom Watson adopts, Holmes follows a trail that leads ultimately and unpredictably to the fabled and fabulous lost Hapsburg Tiara.

            Containing 18 Bible stories (reprints of separately published, slim early reader books), the text is in large type and features short sentences. Each story is told in 25 words or less. The illustrations are large and engaging. At the beginning of each story, a word list is offered, as is educational advice to parents from the author.The Bible stories included are: Creation, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, baby Moses, Jericho, David and Goliath, Jonah and the big fish, the birth of John the Baptist, the first Christmas, Jesus feeding the crowd, the Good Samaritan, Mary and Martha, Jesus blessing the children, Zacchaeus, Jesus entering Jerusalem, the first Easter, and Jesus filling the nets. What I Like: My 5 year old was really excited to have a Bible she can read herself. This is an attractive book, with plenty of interesting, cartoonish illustrations. The text is ideal for beginning readers. Most kids will find some words challenging, but plenty of easier words are included, too.What I Dislike: I really only have two small complaints about this book. One pops up during the story of David and Goliath. Instead of saying King Saul offered David his armor, the author writes that a "soldier"offered his armor. My only other complaint is the way the book ends. Although we never learn why Jesus died and was put on the cross, we do learn about his ressurrection. Then, the last story in the book is about Jesus telling the diciples where to fill their nets. This seems like such a weird way to end the book. Did Jesus come alive again just to tell his friends where to fish?That said, this book clearly isn't meant to replace a child's "read-to-me" Bible. Although this book covers a lot of famous Bible stories, the text is necessarily limited. Think of this as a supplemental Bible designed to give your kids their first experiences in reading the Word every day.Overall Rating: Very Good.Kristina SeleshankoChristian Children's Book Review
