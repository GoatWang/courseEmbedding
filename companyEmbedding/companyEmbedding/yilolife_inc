YiLoLife, Inc. Crusades for Medical Marijuana (MMJ) 


On Wednesday July 13, 2016, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism held a hearing on the potential medical benefits and risks of marijuana use. While certainly a welcome sign of changing legislative attitudes toward marijuana, the tenor of the hearing was cautious and sometimes combative. It isn’t clear what steps, if any, the Subcommittee will now take. Those who are likely to benefit from marijuana’s therapeutic effects shouldn’t hold their collective breath. Nevertheless, the crusade to decriminalize marijuana use continues and campaigners like YiLoLife, Inc. are in its vanguard.
Testimony was submitted by three panels, the members of which included Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. and Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Dr. Susan Weiss, Ph.D., Director of the National Institute On Drug Abuse’s Division Of Extramural Research; Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, M.D., Deputy Center Director of the FDA’s Regulatory Programs; Dr. Daniele Piomelli, Ph.D., Pharm.D., Professor Of Anatomy and Neurobiology at the UC-Irvine; Dr. Stuart Gitlow, M.D., Executive Director of the American Society Of Addiction Medicine’s Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease; and Mr. D. Linden Barber, J.D., Partner at Quarles and Brady, LLP.
Dr. Weiss deferred to the FDA, saying that “rigorously conducted randomized trials are needed to confirm preliminary evidence suggesting the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for a variety of conditions and symptoms. Additional clinical and basic research is needed to support the development of new medications.”
Dr. Douglas Throckmorton of the FDA predictably said “the drug approval process represents the best way to help ensure that safe and effective new medicines, including any such medicines derived from marijuana, are available to patients in need of appropriate medical therapy,” and he then went on to lay out that process. The FDA approval process consists of five stages.
Firstly, there are non-clinical tests on animals to determine drug toxicity. Secondly, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the animal data is submitted. Thirdly, Phase I clinical trials to assess how to safely administer and dose the drug when used in small numbers of healthy volunteers commence. Fourthly, Phase II studies explore the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication over a range of doses and determine short-term side effects. And finally, in Phase III trials, the longer-term effects of the drug involving several thousand subjects are observed.
Dr. Daniele Piomelli warned that THC “and other exogenous cannabinoids hijack the endocannabinoid signaling system, leading to serious side effects,” but, nevertheless, concluded that “promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention” remained.
Dr. Stuart Gitlow denied that medical marijuana exists. He expressed concern that “de-scheduling marijuana (i.e., removing it from the Controlled Substances Act) would simply encourage a ‘free-for-all’ of marijuana products available to the public.”
All this is not very encouraging, particularly as the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) missed its self-imposed June 30 deadline to decide whether to reschedule the drug and recognize its potential therapeutic value. Some believe that the present administration’s ‘just look the other way’ policy will put pressure on the agency to ease its restrictions, although President Obama himself has said that any decision to reschedule marijuana should be left to Congress. But it is to be borne in mind that the DEA’s acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg is on record as saying, “We can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don’t call it medicine.”
Regardless, Mr. D. Linden Barber expressed confidence in the DEA, saying “while some have interpreted DEA’s enforcement role and it historical enforcement actions involving marijuana as an indication that DEA has an institutional bias against marijuana that has not been my experience.”
Time will tell. In the meantime, YiLoLife, Inc. continues its campaign at the state level. The company recently announced its support, with an initial donation of $100,000, for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol (“CRMLA”), the committee backing an initiative to end marijuana prohibition in Arizona.
YiLoLife, Inc. was founded to fill a significant quality gap in the rapidly expanding medical marijuana (MMJ) industry. Recognizing a market full of poorly developed medicated edibles, weak standards, limited selection, and sub-par taste, YiLo set out to produce and distribute a wide selection of high quality, great tasting MMJ products. Today, the YiLo™ brand is associated with premium quality, precision processes, innovative products and customer satisfaction, and the company has established itself as the fastest growing seed-to-shelf marijuana-related brand in Arizona.
Sourcing 100% high-grade medical marijuana from its own cultivation in Arizona, YiLo uses German quality standards to produce tested foods with consistent THC/CBD component levels. A unique traffic light system is used to ensure that consumers understand the dosages: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC, and Red 180mg THC, along with recently developed color codes of Purple 240mg THC, Light Blue 60mg CBD, and Dark Blue 180mg CBD.
YiLo’s award-winning line of nearly 600 products includes various flavors and dosages of cannabis-infused juices and teas, snacks, brownies and cookies, candies and chocolates. In addition to MMJ edibles, the company offers vape kits, caps and shirts, topicals and creams, concentrates and wax, and buds and flowers. YiLo markets its products to dispensaries throughout Arizona, as well as in its new MMJ YiLo Superstore located in Phoenix.

YiLoLife, Inc. – Where It Started 


“The greatest wealth is health.”
The Roman poet Virgil expressed these words thousands of years ago, words that have since been immortalized, adapted, and passed down in variations, including “health is wealth.” Virgil may have declared these words long before he passed in 19 B.C., but the sentiment behind them is as relevant today as it was then.
Today, health is as much about treating the body as it is about treating the mind and spirit. Recognizing this holistic approach to health, YiLoLife has waded into this space with cannabis products that have a way of treating not just pain, but anxiety, depression, and more.
YiLo offers the people of Arizona a broad lineup that its team has called “the best looking and tasting marijuana products.” Along with edibles, such as drinks, cookies, and chocolate bars, YiLo also sells creams and topicals, concentrates and wax, flower and bud items and gear, and it continues to add new items to its portfolio of some 600 products.
YiLoLife was developed to fill a vital need in the fast-growing medical marijuana (MMJ) industry. After noting a major quality gap in the market and the prevalence of poorly-developed medicated edibles, weak standards, limited selection, and sub-par taste, the company set out to become a thriving wholesaler, and now retail supplier, of high quality and great tasting MMJ products. These days, the YiLo brand is associated with the finest quality, novel products, and high customer satisfaction. The company has established itself as the fastest growing seed-to-shelf marijuana-related brand in Arizona.
YiLo products can be found in nearly all of the MMJ dispensaries in Arizona. Every brownie, candy, lolly and infusion from the YiLo kitchen is available in an extensive assortment of flavors and dosages. The key is for each customer to find the product that works; determine the correct dosage; and stick with it. YiLo leverages German quality standards to provide lab-tested products with consistent active-ingredient levels. These dosages are based on an easy-to-use traffic light system to assure the dose is right for each customer: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC, and Red 180mg THC. Based on additional requests, YiLo is now also offering a Purple 240mg THC, and a new product line with a Light Blue 60mg CBD and Dark Blue 180mg CBD.

Press Release

YiLoLife, Inc. Sets Launch Date and Size of Reg A+ Offering





PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwired - Jan 9, 2017) -  YiLoLife, Inc., a company providing management services and other support to the legal medical marijuana (MMJ) market, today announces its plans to raise $16.4 million through a Regulation A+ public offering. 
YiLo has planned three investment rounds:
1. First round is now approved by Security Exchange Commission with limited 5 million YiLo Shares for first public offering with a share value of $3.28 
        2. Second round with an approximate share value of about $8 - $10 
        3. Third round with an approximate share value of about $15 
YiLoLife™ describes a family of companies designed to meet substantially all the specialized operational, business and infrastructure needs of both for-profit and non-profit organizations licensed by the state to consult, manage, possess, grow, sell and otherwise distribute marijuana. To date, Natural Relief Clinic, Inc. ("NRC"), an Arizona non-profit controlled by YiLoLife's controlling shareholders, is the company's sole client, licensee, lessee and customer. NRC offers YiLo™-branded products to qualified medical marijuana patients in Arizona in conformity with non-profit medical marijuana dispensary licenses issued by the Arizona Department of Health Services. 
Fundraising on YiLoLife's crowdfunding platform will commence January 09, 2017, enabling unaccredited investors to buy shares and invest in the company's growing position in the MMJ market, which is expected by industry analysts to surpass $40 billion over the next five to 10 years.

In addition to its focus on Arizona, YiLoLife is working to establish a substantially vertically integrated presence in additional markets with varying degrees of permissible medical and/or adult use marijuana. Beginning with the State of California, the company plans to natively replicate its model by contracting with newly organized non-profit MMJ organization(s) on an exclusive basis. 
The company intends to use the proceeds of today's announced offering to acquire and develop cultivation, food processing and distribution facilities suitable to produce YiLo™-branded products on appropriate scale to serve the existing medicinal market, as well as the expected adult-use market expected to manifest in the near term. In addition, the company expects to use a portion of the offering proceeds for working capital. 
"We are excited to take advantage of the capital-raising and ancillary benefits offered through the Regulation A+ platform," says Carsten Loelke, founder of YiLoLife. "At the same time, this method of fundraising gives the general public a chance to invest in our growth cycle and be a part of the broader MMJ market. There is a rampant increase in demand for YiLo-branded products and we look forward to meeting and even exceeding expectations."
Under updated and expanded rules of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, Regulation A+ allows smaller companies to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities within 12 months while bypassing registration requirements, per the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The new rules are designed to encourage and help facilitate smaller companies access to capital while providing unaccredited investors more investment opportunities.

Largest U.S. Banks Host Accounts 
for Marijuana Businesses, Says American Banker 






Palm Beach, FL --January 31, 2017 -- A recent study1 commissioned by 
industry journal American Banker reveals that the nation’s four largest banks 
have opened accounts for pot shops and marijuana-related businesses. This is 
good news for companies like Cannabis Science Inc. (CBIS), Eco Science 
Solutions, Inc. (ESSI), Medical Marijuana, Inc. (MJNA), Marijuana Company of 
America Inc. (MCOA), mCig, Inc. (MCIG) and 
YiLoLife, Inc. – all of which 
provide a variety of services or interest to the marijuana community and would 
benefit from commercial banking services. 

Conducted by MRB Monitor, a firm that helps financial institutions identify the 
risks associated with the marijuana industry, the study examined public records 
in the state of Massachusetts and found that 34 percent of businesses that filed 
to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts between June 2015 and 
September 2016 had one or more accounts at Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells 
Fargo, or JPMorgan Chase. 

If a similar pattern of working with the marijuana industry takes hold in 
Washington D.C. and the U.S. states that have legalized marijuana, the prospect 
of financial services for cannabis outfits may not be as dire as it at first 
appears.

Bank of America seems to have been the most accommodating. Over half of the 
marijuana businesses included in the survey had accounts at the bank, though it 
previously told the Statesman Journal2 that “as a federally regulated financial 
institution, we abide by federal law and do not bank marijuana-related 
businesses.” 

Guidelines issued by federal authorities in 2014 appeared to have offered 
financial institutions a legal avenue to provide their services to 
marijuana-related businesses (MRBs). Back then, the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network (FinCEN), part of the U.S. Treasury Department, provided guidance3 it 
said was meant to “enhance the availability of financial services for, and the 
financial transparency of, marijuana-related businesses.” 

Yet, under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), it is illegal to manufacture, 
distribute, or dispense marijuana, and marijuana - like heroin, LSD and ecstasy 
– remains a Schedule 1 substance under the statute. 

In December 2016, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, a member of the Senate 
Banking Committee, along with nine other senators sent a letter to FinCEN 
requesting guidance on how banking services might be offered to “indirect 
businesses” that “provide services to the state-sanctioned marijuana industry.”


Hopefully, after nomination season comes to a close, a response to that letter 
will be forthcoming; there’s a lot at stake. As ArcView Market Research wrote, 
“Cannabis is arguably the fastest growing industry in the world. Regulated 
marijuana sales in North America totaled $6.9 billion in 2016, a 30 percent 
increase from 2015. Sales are projected to increase to $21.6 billion by the year 
2021 representing a 26 percent compound annual growth rate.” 

YiLoLife is gearing up to reap this 
burgeoning marijuana harvest. The company recently offered up to 5 million 
shares of its Class A common stock, at a price of $3.28 per share, under a 
Regulation A+ filing. YiLoLife 
plans to use some $12 million from this share offering in adding capital assets, 
as well as toward the acquisition and development of cultivation, food 
processing and distribution facilities. A further $1.5 million will be expended 
on equipment, furniture and fixtures and $1.0 million will go to improve 
security. The remaining $1.9 million will be allocated toward bolstering working 
capital. 

Other industry players are also positioning themselves. Cannabis Science (CBIS) 
is a biotech company that discovers and develops novel cannabinoid-based 
therapies to those critically in need of new treatments for life threatening and 
debilitating conditions. Eco Science Solutions, Inc. (ESSI) is a Hawaii-based 
technology company targeting the multi-billion dollar health and wellness 
industry. 

Marijuana Company of America (MCOA) is a marketing and distribution company that 
plans to deliver all the benefits of cannabis by providing a wide range of 
services for cannabis businesses and entrepreneurs. The company focuses on 
leisure, wellness, health, and beauty-specific cannabis products. 

And last but not least is mCig (MCIG). Driven by a management team with over 75 
years of combined experience, this is a company that provides turnkey, durable, 
modular, ISO clean, high-yielding cultivation rooms to marijuana growers.

YiLoLife, Inc. Public Offering 
Gives General Public Ground Floor Opportunity to Invest In Legal Marijuana 
Market, Expected To Jump From $7 Billion to $40 Billion Over Next 5-10 Years 






January 9, 2017 - YiLoLife, 
Inc., an expanding company providing management and support services to 
the legal medical marijuana (MMJ) industry, is now open for investment to the 
general public through an SEC approved Regulation A+ public offering. This 
represents a ground floor opportunity for investors as the first in three 
planned investment rounds:

1.First round is now approved by Security Exchange Commission with limited 5 
million YiLo Shares for first public offering with a share value of $3.28

2.Second round with an approximate share value of about $8 – $10

3.Third round with an approximate share value of about $15

Arizona based YiLoLife was founded to address a significant unmet need in the 
medical marijuana industry. Products were being produced and sold with little 
concern for taste, proper standards, and selection. The fast growth of the MMJ 
market allowed lax quality, with businesses making money in spite of weak 
products. The YiLo™ brand was created to upgrade all aspects of the industry and 
its offerings. Today, the YiLo™ brand represents the top-of-the-line in product 
and operational quality, offering over 600 MMJ products and attracting a loyal 
customer base. With German quality standards ensuring consistent medical levels, 
and unsurpassed taste quality, it is now the fastest growing seed-to-shelf 
marijuana-related brand in Arizona. Natural Relief Clinic, Inc. (NRC), 
YiLoLife’s exclusive client, markets YiLo™ products through specialized 
dispensaries across Arizona and its MMJ YiLo Superstore located at 2841 W. 
Thunderbird Rd in Phoenix. In addition, YiLoLife intends to natively replicate 
its model by contracting with newly organized non-profit MMJ organization(s) on 
an exclusive basis, beginning with California. 

This first round mini IPO-style public offering, under Regulation A+ of the Jobs 
Act, targets a $16.4 million fundraise, with net proceeds to be used for 
acquisition and development of cultivation, food processing, and distribution 
facilities, as well as for working capital. The offering gives the general 
public the opportunity to invest in YiLoLife’s rapid growth in providing 
services to the legal marijuana market, which is on pace to become one of the 
fastest growing industries in the United States.

YiLoLife, Inc. Supporting 
Arizona Bill to Legalize Recreational Use Despite Failed Vote






December 29, 2016 - Last month, Arizona narrowly rejected an initiative 
to legalize recreational marijuana use, but supporters of legalization are not 
discouraged by the failed vote and are already mobilizing to find alternative 
ways for the substance to become fully legal statewide. While a new proposition 
is being drafted for the next election, an Arizona lawmaker is considering a 
different approach that would get recreational marijuana use legalized through 
the state legislature, if successful, according to the Tenth Amendment Center 
blog. 

The bill was prefiled for introduction during the 2017 legislative session by 
Rep. Mark Cardenas (D-Louisville), and if it is passed, it would mark a big step 
toward virtually annulling federal cannabis prohibition as well. Cardenas’s 
House Bill 2003 (HB2003) shares many similarities with Proposition 205, which 
was rejected in the November election by a narrow margin: 51.32 percent voted 
against recreational legalization and 48.68 percent voted in favor. Prop 205 was 
sponsored by the Coalition for the Regulation of Marijuana like Alcohol and 
supported by several dispensaries, medical marijuana manufacturers and other 
organizations, including YiLoLife, 
Inc., a holding company. The YiLo™ branded product line represents 
popular, top-quality MMJ products. 

If successful, HB2003 would allow any individual age 21 or above to possess, 
use, display, purchase, consume or transport up to one ounce of marijuana, or up 
to five marijuana plants and the cannabis produced by those plants at their 
location. Additionally, any individual over the age of 21 would be permitted to 
transfer up to one ounce of marijuana and five immature marijuana plants to 
another person of legal age, without remuneration. The bill would also allow any 
individual of legal age to assist another person who is at least 21 in any of 
the acts listed above. 

Furthermore, the bill would enforce an excise tax of $50 per marijuana ounce, 
with half the revenue so collected going to the general fund and the other half 
going toward health and educational programs. The Department of Health Services 
would be tasked with regulating the recreational cannabis industry in the state, 
while marijuana retailers and vendors would be required to register and get 
local and state officials’ approval for their business locations. Under HB2003, 
if any individual under 21 is caught possessing up to one ounce of marijuana, 
they would be required to either pay a fee of up to $300 or take part in a 
diversion program. 

If the bill is successful during next year’s legislative session, Arizona will 
be the first state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana through its 
legislature instead of a ballot initiative process. In addition, passage of the 
bill would basically nullify the current federal prohibition on marijuana, with 
the Drug Enforcement Agency still listing cannabis among Schedule I controlled 
substances. Several states are already ignoring the prohibition, as more than 
two dozen allow medical marijuana use and eight others allow recreational use, 
as well. 

In Arizona, YiLoLife remains a staunch supporter of legalization, constantly 
committed to educating the general public about the benefits of marijuana. The 
YiLo™ brand now offers an impressive, award-winning line of more than 600 
medical marijuana products, available for patients suffering from various 
ailments, from glaucoma and Hepatitis C to cancer, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer’s, 
Chron’s disease, PTSD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and more.

YiLoLife, Inc.

 

YiLoLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded to fill a significant quality gap in the rapidly expanding medical marijuana (MMJ) industry. Recognizing a market full of poorly developed medicated edibles, weak standards, limited selection, and subpar taste, YiLo set forth to produce and distribute a wide selection of high-quality, great tasting MMJ products. Today, the YiLo™ brand is associated with premium quality, precision processes, innovative products and customer satisfaction, and the company has established itself as the fastest growing seed-to-shelf marijuana-related brand in Arizona.
Sourcing 100% high-grade medical marijuana from its own cultivation in Arizona, YiLo uses German quality standards to produce tested foods with consistent THC/CBD component levels. A unique traffic light system is used to ensure that consumers understand the dosages: Green 60mg THC, Yellow 120mg THC, and Red 180mg THC, along with recently developed color codes of Purple 240mg THC, Light Blue 60mg CBD, and Dark Blue 180mg CBD. 
YiLo’s award-winning line of nearly 600 products includes various flavors and dosages of cannabis-infused juices and teas, snacks, brownies and cookies, candies and chocolates. In addition to MMJ edibles, the company offers vape kits, caps and shirts, topicals and creams, concentrates and wax, and buds and flowers. YiLo markets its products to dispensaries throughout Arizona, as well as in its YiLo Superstore located in Phoenix. 
The YiLo Superstore has been called a medical marijuana patient’s paradise, includes over 40 MMJ strains, along with the state’s biggest array of organic edibles that are made fresh and without harmful preservatives or additives. The store also includes a wide range of MMJ accessory products.  The YiLo brand continues to grow in popularity, and there is no shortage of testimonials, with one simply saying “Hands down the best product out there.”

YiLoLife, Inc. Sets Launch Date and Size of Reg A+ Offering 



PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwired - Jan 9, 2017) -  YiLoLife, Inc., a company providing management services and other support to the legal medical marijuana (MMJ) market, today announces its plans to raise $16.4 million through a Regulation A+ public offering. 
YiLo has planned three investment rounds:
1. First round is now approved by Security Exchange Commission with limited 5 million YiLo Shares for first public offering with a share value of $3.28 
        2. Second round with an approximate share value of about $8 - $10 
        3. Third round with an approximate share value of about $15 
YiLoLife™ describes a family of companies designed to meet substantially all the specialized operational, business and infrastructure needs of both for-profit and non-profit organizations licensed by the state to consult, manage, possess, grow, sell and otherwise distribute marijuana. To date, Natural Relief Clinic, Inc. ("NRC"), an Arizona non-profit controlled by YiLoLife's controlling shareholders, is the company's sole client, licensee, lessee and customer. NRC offers YiLo™-branded products to qualified medical marijuana patients in Arizona in conformity with non-profit medical marijuana dispensary licenses issued by the Arizona Department of Health Services. 
Fundraising on YiLoLife's crowdfunding platform will commence January 09, 2017, enabling unaccredited investors to buy shares and invest in the company's growing position in the MMJ market, which is expected by industry analysts to surpass $40 billion over the next five to 10 years.

In addition to its focus on Arizona, YiLoLife is working to establish a substantially vertically integrated presence in additional markets with varying degrees of permissible medical and/or adult use marijuana. Beginning with the State of California, the company plans to natively replicate its model by contracting with newly organized non-profit MMJ organization(s) on an exclusive basis. 
The company intends to use the proceeds of today's announced offering to acquire and develop cultivation, food processing and distribution facilities suitable to produce YiLo™-branded products on appropriate scale to serve the existing medicinal market, as well as the expected adult-use market expected to manifest in the near term. In addition, the company expects to use a portion of the offering proceeds for working capital. 
"We are excited to take advantage of the capital-raising and ancillary benefits offered through the Regulation A+ platform," says Carsten Loelke, founder of YiLoLife. "At the same time, this method of fundraising gives the general public a chance to invest in our growth cycle and be a part of the broader MMJ market. There is a rampant increase in demand for YiLo-branded products and we look forward to meeting and even exceeding expectations."
Under updated and expanded rules of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, Regulation A+ allows smaller companies to offer and sell up to $50 million of securities within 12 months while bypassing registration requirements, per the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The new rules are designed to encourage and help facilitate smaller companies access to capital while providing unaccredited investors more investment opportunities.
