Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II Announces Estimated Value Per Share of $9.37
























EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








Griffin Capital Company, LLC ("Griffin Capital") announced today that the board of directors (the "Board") of Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. (the "REIT") has established an estimated value per share of $9.37 as of December 31, 2016.        









Commenting on the REIT's estimated value per share, Kevin A. Shields, Griffin Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are happy to announce the initial valuation of the REIT and feel this estimated value per share represents our dedication to continue to provide value to our stockholders through the investment in business essential, single-tenant, net-leased properties. We are particularly pleased with the composition of the REIT's portfolio, particularly related to the REIT's build-to-suit transactions, which were priced well in advance of their respective acquisitions and 'renovation-to-suit' transactions, which were acquired with favorable acquisition prices. We believe the ongoing success of the REIT's portfolio reflects not only our real estate investment expertise, but also our discipline and experience as owner-operators of commercial real estate properties who are skilled at generating value for our stockholder through the creation of ongoing income and long-term capital appreciation."


                                        








The REIT engaged Duff & Phelps, LLC ("Duff & Phelps"), an independent third-party valuation firm, to appraise the REIT's portfolio and to provide the Board with a range of estimated values per share, calculated as of December 31, 2016. The Board, at the recommendation of the REIT's nominating and corporate governance committee, comprised solely of independent directors, approved an estimated value per share of $9.37 based on the estimated value of the REIT's assets less the estimated value of the REIT's liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the approximate number of outstanding shares, calculated as of December 31, 2016. This methodology complies with the Investment Program Association's practice guideline regarding valuations of publicly registered non-listed REITs ("IPA guidelines").


                                        








Consistent with the IPA guidelines, Duff & Phelps' valuation does not include a portfolio premium that may reasonably be expected to accrue in a typical real estate valuation process conducted for transaction purposes, nor does it reflect an enterprise value. For more information regarding the valuation and the assumptions and methodologies used, please see the REIT's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2017.

Overview & Strategy

Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II is focused on providing INCOME(2) to investors by acquiring office and industrial real estate properties we believe are ESSENTIAL to the creditworthy corporate tenants that occupy them, while building a diversified portfolio managed by our team of EXPERIENCED real estate professionals.

Objectives
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II's primary investment objectives* are to:

invest in income-producing real property in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes;
provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders;
preserve and protect your invested capital; and
achieve appreciation in the value of our properties over the long term.

Acquisition Strategy
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. seeks to acquire a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant business essential properties throughout the United States, diversified by corporate credit, physical geography, product type and lease duration. Although Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II has no current intention to do so, Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II may also invest a portion of the net proceeds in single tenant business essential properties outside the United States. Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II intends to acquire assets consistent with our single tenant acquisition philosophy by focusing primarily on properties:

essential to the business operations of the tenant;
located in primary, secondary and certain select tertiary markets;
leased to tenants with stable and/or improving credit quality; and
subject to long-term leases with defined rental rate increases or with short-term leases with high-probability renewal and potential for increasing rent.

Business Essential Assets
Business essential assets are those that the tenant must continue to operate and occupy to maintain business continuity-regardless of prevailing economic conditions. Representative examples of business essential properties:

World, national or regional headquarters buildings
Primary distribution centers
Principal manufacturing facilities

We believe real estate with business essential attributes provides for longer term leases, increases the probability of lease renewal and enables rental rate growth and thereby enhances valuation and portfolio appreciation potential at exit.
*There is no guarantee that Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc., will be able to achieve these investment objectives.

Logos shown are those of tenants, lease guarantors or non-guarantor parent companies at our properties.
(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings or Bloomberg equivalent ratings.
(2) Distributions may come from sources other than cash flow from operations.

This website is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Only the prospectus can make such an offer. Therefore, a copy of the prospectus must be made available to you in connection with the offering. This marketing material must be read in conjunction with the prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates. Because it is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. offering fully, you should read the entire prospectus and Risk Factors carefully, including "Questions and Answers" and "Risk Factors" sections and the financial statements, before making a decision to invest in our shares. Some of the risks associated with this offering include the following: limited operating history; "blind pool" offering; this is a "best efforts" offering and some or all of our shares may not be sold; no minimum offering amount, and our ability to diversify our portfolio will depend on our ability to raise funds in this offering; no public market currently exists for our shares; it may be difficult to sell your shares, and if you do, it will likely be at a substantial discount; we must depend on our advisor to conduct our operations; we will pay substantial fees and expenses to our advisor which will reduce cash available for investment and distribution; there are substantial conflicts of interest among us and our sponsor, advisor, dealer manager and property manager; we may borrow funds, issue new securities or sell assets to make distributions, some of which may constitute a return of capital; we may use substantial debt to acquire our properties, especially in the early years, which could hinder our ability to pay distributions; we may fail to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any of our investment objectives. No offering is made to New York residents except by a prospectus filed with the Department of Law of the State of New York. The Attorney General of the State of New York has not passed or endorsed the merits of the offering. Use of this website is subject to its Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a REIT, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) promulgated a measure known as funds from operations (“FFO”). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property, adding back asset impairment write-downs, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do, making comparisons less meaningful. The Investment Program Association (“IPA”) issued Practice Guideline 2010-01 (the “IPA MFFO Guideline”) on November 2, 2010, which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations (“MFFO”). In computing MFFO, FFO is adjusted for certain non-operating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain non-cash items such as straight-line rent, amortization of in-place lease valuations, amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss), and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Management is responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments, if any, we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure, if any, we may enter into foreign currency hedges. We view fair value adjustments of derivatives, impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations, assessments regarding general market conditions, and the specific performance of properties owned, which can change over time. No less frequently than annually, we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. We adopted the IPA MFFO Guideline as management believes that MFFO is a beneficial indicator of our on-going portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level. More specifically, MFFO isolates the financial results of the REIT’s operations. MFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, MFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends. By providing FFO and MFFO, we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management’s analysis of long-term operating activities. MFFO also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other REITs that are not currently engaging in acquisitions, as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other non-traded REITs, as MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. As explained below, management’s evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of MFFO based on the following economic considerations: Revenues in excess of cash received, net. Most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, these contractual periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straight-line basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting. As straight-line rent is a GAAP non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, FFO is adjusted for the effect of straight-line rent to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio. In addition, when applicable, in conjunction with certain acquisitions, we may enter into a master escrow or lease agreement with a seller, whereby the seller is obligated to pay us rent pertaining to certain spaces impacted by existing rental abatements. In accordance with GAAP, these proceeds are recorded as an adjustment to the allocation of real estate assets at the time of acquisition, and, accordingly, are not included in revenues, net income, or FFO. This application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from current contract terms. By adjusting for this item, we believe MFFO is reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases (including master agreements) that is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performance.Amortization of in-place lease valuation. Acquired in-place leases are valued as above-market or below-market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between (a) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (b) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for above-market leases. The above-market and below-market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. As amortization of in-place lease valuation is a non-cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings, FFO is adjusted for the effect of the amortization to arrive at MFFO as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio.Acquisition-related costs. We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income-producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders. In the process, we incur non-reimbursable affiliated and non-affiliated acquisition-related costs, which in accordance with GAAP are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), for property acquisitions accounted for as a business combination. These costs have been funded with cash proceeds from our Primary Offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate. If we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from our Primary Offering have been invested, there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, unless our Advisor determines to waive the payment of any then-outstanding acquisition-related costs otherwise payable to our Advisor, such costs will be paid from additional debt, operational earnings or cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. In evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time, management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments’ revenues and expenses. Acquisition-related costs may negatively affect our operating results, cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired, as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets. By excluding acquisition-related costs, MFFO may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made. However, it can provide an indication of our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis, which can be compared to the MFFO of other non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours. Management believes that excluding these costs from MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management.Gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt. We use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio. As a term of obtaining this debt, we will pay financing costs to the respective lender. Financing costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt. We consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties. From time to time, we may cancel certain debt obligations and replace these canceled debt obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us. In doing so, we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt, which we consider to be a cost, or loss, on extinguishing such debt. Management believes that this loss is considered an event not associated with our operations, and therefore, deems this write off to be an exclusion from MFFO.Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments. These adjustments include unrealized gains (losses) from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.  The change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements. For all of these reasons, we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and MFFO, in addition to income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities, as defined by GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and MFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and MFFO. The use of MFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our on-going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete. However, FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO and MFFO. Therefore, FFO and MFFO should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate MFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, the SEC or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure. Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):     Three Months Ended March 31,    2017 2016Net income (loss)   $3,124  $(1,141)Adjustments:      Depreciation of building and improvements   4,892  2,338 Amortization of leasing costs and intangibles   5,631  3,288 FFO   $13,647  $4,485 Distributions to noncontrolling interests   (3) (3)FFO, adjusted for noncontrolling interest distributions   $13,644  $4,482 Reconciliation of FFO to MFFO:      Adjusted FFO   $13,644  $4,482 Adjustments:      Acquisition fees and expenses to non-affiliates   -  94 Acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates   -  870 Revenues in excess of cash received, net   (2,219) (752)Amortization of below market rent, net   (1,033) (806)Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives   23  (96)MFFO   $10,415  $3,792   GRIFFIN CAPITAL ESSENTIAL ASSET REIT II, INC.Adjusted EBITDA(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)     Three Months Ended March 31,ADJUSTED EBITDA(1):   2017 2016                                          Net income/(loss)   $3,124  $(1,141)Depreciation and amortization    10,523   5,626 Interest expense    3,204   2,225 Unused commitment fee    81   174 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives    23   (96)Amortization – Deferred financing costs    271   190 Amortization – In-place lease    (1,033)  (806)Income taxes    82   21 Asset management fees    2,746   1,270 Property management fees (affiliated)    426   195 Property management fees (third party)    10   - Acquisition fees and expenses    -   964 Deferred rent    (4,173)  (752)     15,284   7,870 Less: Capital reserves    (321)  (164)Adjusted EBITDA (per credit facility)   $14,963  $7,706           Interest expense   $3,204  $2,225            Interest Coverage Ratio(2)    4.67   3.46 Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio(3)    4.67   3.46             1Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility agreement, is calculated as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), plus acquisition fees and expenses, asset and property management fees, straight-line rents and in-place lease amortization for the period less certain reserves for capital expenditures. 2Interest coverage is the ratio of interest expense as if the corresponding debt was in place at the beginning of the period to adjusted EBITDA. 3Fixed charge coverage is the ratio of principal amortization for the period plus interest expense as if the corresponding debt were in place at the beginning of the period plus preferred unit distributions as if in place at the beginning of the period over adjusted EBITDA.Media Contacts:

A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e9a9e39d-b034-467d-b66d-924fccc750c9 Located in Lone Tree, Colorado, the Property was developed in 2000 as a build-to-suit for Sprint/Nextel, which occupied the building for approximately 15 years, prior to being fully leased by Allstate (ALL), with extensive interior renovations undertaken in 2015.  Commenting on the acquisition, Michael Escalante, Griffin Capital's Chief Investment Officer and President of the REIT, said, "The Denver metropolitan area has been of increasing interest to leading real estate investors and operators across the country over the past several years in particular.  We're excited for the REIT to enter this rapidly growing market for the first time through the acquisition of an institutional-grade asset with the key features necessary to generate value for our investors.  The property's location and its status as a fully leased facility under a long-term agreement with a nationally-recognized, Fortune 500 tenant speak for themselves.  We're very pleased that this transaction enables the REIT to further diversify its holdings from both a geographic and credit concentration perspective.  Equally important, this acquisition has been accomplished at an attractive risk-adjusted return given the credit quality, annual rental rate escalations, and duration.” Louis Sohn, Griffin Capital’s Director of Acquisitions, added, “In an environment characterized by intense competition for the acquisition of high quality, income-generating commercial properties, we're delighted that our expertise as both a real estate investor and operator have enabled us to identify and acquire a top tier asset in a fast-growing community with potential for both income generation and long-term capital appreciation.  We look forward to deploying our managerial and operational expertise into this newest asset in our growing REIT." The REIT purchased the Property from Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, which was represented by CBRE.  Allstate Insurance Company is a wholly-owned and primary operating subsidiary of Allstate Corporation (ALL) , which primarily provides property-liability and life insurance, as well as other types of insurance products in both the United States and Canada. As of the third quarter of 2016, Allstate Corporation (ALL) served more than 16 million households in all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Canada, and was ranked #81 in the 2016 Fortune 500. The Property serves as a key operating facility for Allstate (ALL) in Denver.  Located 17 miles southeast of Downtown Denver, the Property has convenient access north-south via Interstate 25 and east-west via E-470.  Interstate 25, which is the area’s major north-south thoroughfare, bisects the state of Colorado and connects Denver with Albuquerque, New Mexico to the South and Cheyenne, Wyoming to the North.     About Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. is a publicly registered non-traded REIT focused on acquiring a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant business essential properties throughout the United States, diversified by corporate credit, physical geography, product type and lease duration.

This website is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Only the prospectus can make such an offer. Therefore, a copy of the prospectus must be made available to you in connection with the offering. This marketing material must be read in conjunction with the prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates. Because it is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. offering fully, you should read the entire prospectus and Risk Factors carefully, including "Questions and Answers" and "Risk Factors" sections and the financial statements, before making a decision to invest in our shares. Some of the risks associated with this offering include the following: limited operating history; "blind pool" offering; this is a "best efforts" offering and some or all of our shares may not be sold; no minimum offering amount, and our ability to diversify our portfolio will depend on our ability to raise funds in this offering; no public market currently exists for our shares; it may be difficult to sell your shares, and if you do, it will likely be at a substantial discount; we must depend on our advisor to conduct our operations; we will pay substantial fees and expenses to our advisor which will reduce cash available for investment and distribution; there are substantial conflicts of interest among us and our sponsor, advisor, dealer manager and property manager; we may borrow funds, issue new securities or sell assets to make distributions, some of which may constitute a return of capital; we may use substantial debt to acquire our properties, especially in the early years, which could hinder our ability to pay distributions; we may fail to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any of our investment objectives. No offering is made to New York residents except by a prospectus filed with the Department of Law of the State of New York.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

the parties to the Selected Dealer Agreement, Ameriprise’s
costs of technology associated with the offering, other costs and
expenses related to such technology costs, and the facilitation of
the marketing of the Shares and the ownership of such Shares by
Ameriprise’s customers, including fees to attend
Company-sponsored conferences (the “Distribution
Expenses”), and (iii) pursuant to Section 6(b) of the
Selected Dealer Agreement, the Company may reimburse Ameriprise to
the extent that Ameriprise’s compliance with an Ad Hoc
Request (as defined in Section 6(b) of the Selected Dealer
Agreement) would cause Ameriprise to incur additional material
expenses, in which case the Company and Ameriprise will mutually
agree as to the payment of such expenses between the parties (the
“Ad Hoc Request Expenses” and, collectively with the
Marketing Fee, the Due Diligence Expenses, and the Distribution
Expenses, the “Cost Reimbursement Compensation”);
and
 
WHEREAS,
AEIS, an SEC registered broker-dealer and Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member (CRD # 26506), is
an affiliate of Ameriprise and currently provides clearing and
related services solely and exclusively for Ameriprise;
and
 
WHEREAS,
the Dealer Manager and AEIS are parties to that certain Alternative
Investment Product Networking Services Agreement, dated June 5,
2013 as amended (the “AIP Networking Agreement”),
pursuant to which the broker-controlled accounts of
Ameriprise’s customers that invest in the Company will be
processed and serviced; and
 
WHEREAS,
Ameriprise intends to migrate its cost
reimbursement-related operations to AEIS as of the Effective
Date , and thereafter AEIS shall
provide such services to Ameriprise financial advisors affiliated
with Ameriprise.
 
NOW,
THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Issuer Entities
and AEIS agree as follows:
 

 



 






 



 


1.
    
Cost
Reimbursement Services

 

As
of the Effective Date and continuing thereafter, AEIS will perform,
for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company who are clients
of Ameriprise, certain broker-dealer services including, but not
limited to, distribution, marketing, administration and stockholder
servicing support (the “Cost Reimbursement Services”),
which were previously performed by Ameriprise under the Selected
Dealer Agreement. Cost Reimbursement Services performed by AEIS
will further include product due
diligence, training and education, and other support-related
functions. These Cost Reimbursement Services will be performed at
AEIS by associated persons of AEIS.

 

2.
    
Payment
Amounts

 

As
of the Effective Date and continuing thereafter, in consideration
of the Cost Reimbursement Services to be provided by AEIS, (i) the
Marketing Fee shall be re-allowed directly to AEIS by the Dealer
Manager, (ii) the amount of any Due Diligence Expenses shall be
paid by the Advisor directly to or on behalf of AEIS (as directed
by AEIS), (iii) the Dealer Manager shall pay or cause to be paid
directly to AEIS the amount of any Distribution Expenses incurred
by AEIS, subject to Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as
mutually agreed upon by the parties to this Agreement, and (iv) the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount
of any Ad Hoc Request Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Issuer Entities and AEIS
specifically acknowledge and agree that the payments described in
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 2 shall be remitted
directly to AEIS, and the payment of Due Diligence Expenses in
clause (ii) of this Section 2 shall be remitted directly to or on
behalf of AEIS (as directed by AEIS), in each case separate and
apart from the Selling Commissions (as defined in the Selected
Dealer Agreement) and distribution and stockholder servicing fee
(the “Distribution Fees”) payable to Ameriprise under
Section 3(d) of the Selected Dealer Agreement. AEIS acknowledges
and agrees that AEIS shall be entitled to receive only the
Marketing Fees and other amounts payable to AEIS pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and AEIS shall not be entitled to receive
the Selling Commissions and Distribution Fees payable to Ameriprise
pursuant to the Selected Dealer Agreement, which shall continue to
be remitted directly to Ameriprise pursuant to the terms of the
Selected Dealer Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer
Entities acknowledge and agree that such payment of Cost
Reimbursement Compensation to AEIS shall not be paid as a
‘pass-through’ to Ameriprise for payment to
AEIS.

 

3.
    
Payment
Process

 








(a)




The
Dealer Manager shall re-allow to AEIS out of its dealer manager fee
a Marketing Fee of up to 1.5% of the full price of each Class T
Share (except for Class T Shares sold pursuant to the DRIP) sold by
Ameriprise; provided however , the Dealer Manager will not
pay AEIS a Marketing Fee if the aggregate underwriting compensation
to be paid to all parties in connection with the Offering exceeds
the limitations prescribed by FINRA.




 

No
payment of the Marketing Fee will be made in respect of
subscriptions for Shares (or portions thereof) which are rejected
by the Company. The Marketing Fee will be paid via an electronic
wire transfer initiated by the Dealer Manager according to the wire
instructions set forth immediately below on the second business day
following the week in which the dealer manager fee on the
applicable Shares sold by Ameriprise is received by the Dealer
Manager from the Company. The Marketing Fee will be payable only
with respect to transactions lawful in the jurisdictions where they
occur. AEIS affirms that the Dealer Manager’s liability for
the Cost Reimbursement Compensation and any other amount payable
from the Dealer Manager to AEIS is limited solely to the amount of
the dealer manager fees received by the Dealer Manager from the
Company, and AEIS hereby waives any and all rights to receive
payment of the Marketing Fee and any other amount due to AEIS until
such time as the Dealer Manager has received from the Company the
dealer manager fees from the sale of Shares by Ameriprise. No
Marketing Fees shall be paid to AEIS for purchases made by an
investor pursuant to the Company’s distribution reinvestment
plan.

(b)




The
Advisor shall pay or cause to be paid to or on behalf of AEIS (as
directed by AEIS) the amount of any Due Diligence Expenses
consistent with the language in the Offering Documents, applicable
regulations and FINRA rules. The Advisor shall pay or cause to be
paid to or on behalf of AEIS (as directed by AEIS) the amount of
any invoice for such Due Diligence Expenses within two weeks of the
Advisor’s receipt of such invoice.



 








(c)




The
Dealer Manager shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the
amount of any Distribution Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Dealer Manager shall pay or
cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount of any invoice for
such Distribution Expenses within two weeks of the Dealer
Manager’s receipt of such invoice.



 








(d)




The
Company shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount
of any Ad Hoc Request Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Company shall pay or cause to be
paid directly to AEIS the amount of any invoice for such Ad Hoc
Request Expenses within two weeks of the Company’s receipt of
such invoice.



 








(e)




AEIS
will have sole responsibility and AEIS’s records will provide
the sole basis (in each instance with the assistance of Ameriprise)
for calculating the Marketing Fees payable to AEIS under this
Agreement and the amounts of the Due Diligence Expenses, the
Distribution Expenses and the Ad Hoc Request Expenses for which
AEIS shall provide invoices under this Agreement. However, the
Issuer Entities may provide records to assist AEIS in its
calculations.



 








(f)




The
parties acknowledge and agree that the total compensation paid to
Ameriprise and AEIS in connection with the Offering pursuant to the
Selected Dealer Agreement and this Agreement shall not exceed the
limitations prescribed by FINRA, including the 10% limitation
prescribed by FINRA Rule 2310 on compensation of participating
broker-dealers, which is calculated with respect to the gross
proceeds from sales of Shares by Ameriprise (except for Shares sold
pursuant to the DRIP). The Company, the Dealer Manager and AEIS
agree to monitor the payment of all fees and expense reimbursements
to assure that FINRA limitations are not exceeded. Accordingly, if
at any time the Company or the Dealer Manager determines in good
faith that any payment to AEIS pursuant to this Agreement and/or
any payment to Ameriprise pursuant to the Selected Dealer Agreement
could result in a violation of the applicable FINRA regulations,
the Company or the Dealer Manager shall promptly notify AEIS, and
the Company, the Dealer Manager and AEIS agree to cooperate with
each other to implement such measures as they determine are
necessary to ensure continued compliance with applicable FINRA
regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company or the
Dealer Manager determines in good faith that any payment to AEIS
pursuant to this Agreement and/or any payment to Ameriprise
pursuant to the Selected Dealer Agreement could result in a
violation of the applicable FINRA regulations and there is a
dispute as to whether Ameriprise or AEIS will return such payment
to the Company or the Dealer Manager in order to ensure continued
compliance with applicable FINRA regulations, then AEIS agrees that
AEIS shall return such payment or payments necessary to ensure
continued compliance with applicable FINRA regulations. However,
nothing in this Amendment shall relieve AEIS and the Dealer Manager
of their obligations to comply with FINRA Rule 2310.




4.
    
Term
and Termination

 

This
Agreement will automatically terminate upon termination of the
Selected Dealer Agreement.

 

 



 






 



 


5.
    
Disclosure

 

The
Issuer Entities agree to keep current all disclosures in the
Company’s Offering Documents regarding the payment of the
Cost Reimbursement Compensation, as may be required by applicable
federal and state laws, regulations and rules and the rules of any
applicable self-regulatory organization (“SRO”),
including but not limited to FINRA.

Warranties and Covenants

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
