About Real Estate Investment Trusts 




                                                    What is a REIT?

                                                    CNL Lifestyle Properties portfolio included ski & mountain lifestyle, attractions, and marinas properties.
                                                




                                                    Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, currently are one of the single largest and most dominant demographic influence in the United States. Baby Boomers represent approximately 77 million of 310 million Americans. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010 more than 76 million Americans will turn 55 or older.
                                                

                                                    Generation Xers and Echo Boomers also represent a significant portion of the population. Generation Xers or Gen Xers, born between 1965 and 1976, account for approximately 50 million Americans. Echo Boomers, the demographic group born between 1977 and 1994, represent approximately 77 million Americans.

                                                    CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. invests using sound investment principles to achieve its investment objectives and help ensure the long-term health of the company. This conservative management strategy* is anchored by three principles**:
                                                




Financial Strength
                                                    CNL Lifestyle Properties strives for the financial strength to achieve its investment objectives such as, continually pay distributions to investors and the flexibility to acquire properties that add value to its portfolio. This is evident in the historically low funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio and low leverage in the non-traded REIT space. FFO is a figure commonly used by REITs to measure the cash generated from operations, and is often used to determine the ability to pay distributions to shareholders.***
                                                

Leasing Structure
                                                    CNL Lifestyle Properties’ long-term triple-net leasing structures help to ensure a steady source of income to the REIT.** This strategy includes security deposits and cross-defaulted provisions, where appropriate. With cross-defaulted provisions, tenants who operate multiple properties may use funds from profitable properties to subsidize underperforming ones. Similarly, if a tenant defaults under one property lease, the company may place them in default under all of their leases, providing additional leverage in resolving an unfavorable situation.
                                                

Diversified Portfolio
                                                    CNL Lifestyle Properties strives to maintain a diversified portfolio of lifestyle real estate assets that reflect demographic trends and shifting utilization patterns. This approach positions the REIT to more easily endure seasonal or market fluctuations. In addition, the REIT establishes long-term relationships with operating partners who are generally considered to be significant industry leaders.
                                                

                                                    * CNL Lifestyle Properties’ board of directors has the authority to change these general strategies and make exceptions to them without notice. There is no assurance that these strategies will result in a steady or increased return on an investment in the shares or that its FFO payout ratio and distribution policy will remain the same. There are risks involved in investing in unlisted REITs. An investment in CNL Lifestyle Properties is subject to significant risks. A more detailed description of the risk factors is found in the section of the prospectus entitled “Risk Factors.” Investors should read the prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses prior to investing.
                                                

                                                    ** In light of the uncertainty arising from the current economic and real estate environments, there can be no assurance that CNL Lifestyle Properties’ strategy and ability to pay distributions will not be adversely affected by tenant defaults, bankruptcies or disagreements related to its leases.
                                                

                                                    *** FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and subsidiaries. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or as an indication of CNL Lifestyle Properties’ liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. There can be no assurance that distributions can be continued at current levels or that the FFO payout ratio will not increase in future periods.

CNL Lifestyle Properties REIT suffers another sharp drop in value
Ski and mountain resort owner declines 24% in 12-month period; now at $5.20 per share

      The estimated per share valuation of CNL Lifestyle Properties Inc., a large nontraded real estate investment trust, continues to sink despite the recent broad rally in commercial real estate. CNL Lifestyle Properties, with $2.5 billion in total assets, on Tuesday said its board of directors unanimously approved a valuation of $5.20 per share as of the end of December, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.That valuation represents a drop of 24% from the end of December 2013; at that time, the board revised its per share valuation to $6.85. In August 2012, the board pegged an estimated per share valuation of $7.31 for the REIT's shares.
				



The REIT was launched over a decade ago and started selling in May 2004 for $10 per share, the standard offering price for a nontraded REIT. Other large nontraded REITs that raised money from investors before the 2007 and 2008 credit and mortgage crisis have also seen severe drops in valuations. Meanwhile, the NCREIF Property Index, which tracks a broad basket of private illiquid real estate investments has posted consecutive positive quarterly returns starting in the first quarter of 2010, according to the website for the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries.  Last year, the returns for the four quarters ranged from 2.63% to 3.04%, according to the website. POTENTIAL SALE, LISTINGCNL Lifestyle Properties, which owns properties in ski and mountain resorts, senior housing and other lifestyle sectors, has hired Jefferies, an investment bank, to examine the potential for a sale of its properties or listing on an exchange, the company said in its filing with the SEC on Tuesday. It has also recently been selling assets and using the majority of the proceeds to pay down debt.One adviser was scratching his head about the drop in the NAV for CNL Lifestyle Properties. “We realize that real estate valuations can be very subjective and are assumptively driven, but this makes us question the usefulness and reliability of the appraised value of this asset for performance reporting and explaining results to clients,” said Larry Solomon, director of investments and financial planning with OptiFour Integrated Wealth Management. “Ultimately, I guess we will need to reserve judgment until the market gives its appraisal of CNL Lifestyle when it lists.”Pointing to the disclosure in the SEC filings, Monty Hagler, a spokesman for CNL Lifestyle Properties, noted that the board's assessment of a $5.20 per share valuation was due to the increase in information and data it received from Jefferies, along with real estate investment bank CBRE Capital Advisors Inc., as it shopped the REIT's portfolio in the market.“The drop in valuation is a reflection of the process,” he said. The investment banks have “looked at different liquidity options and talked to more than 150 potential bidders. They recognized the true value of different pieces in the portfolio and that was reflected in the new share price.”
