Sheryl Sandberg’s last words to her husband, like all last words, assumed a haunting poignancy. “I’m falling asleep,” she told him, oblivious to the imminence of tragedy, and curled up on a cushion for a nap.
It was Friday 1 May 2015. She and Dave Goldberg, 47, had left their two children at home with her parents in northern California and flown down to Mexico for a weekend break to celebrate a friend’s 50th birthday. They were Silicon Valley royalty’s power couple; he the CEO of a tech company worth more than $1bn, she the chief operating officer of Facebook and author of global bestseller Lean In, a feminist call to arms for working women to emulate the self-belief and ambition of men. Sandberg had featured on Forbes’ list of the most powerful women on the planet, served as chief of staff to the Treasury secretary in Bill Clinton’s government, been widely tipped as a future member of a Hillary Clinton cabinet and earned a personal fortune well in excess of $1bn. At 45 she was mother to a 10-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter; weekends away were rare and precious. No wonder she was tired. She fell asleep that afternoon a happily married wife, and woke up an hour later a widow.
When Sandberg didn’t see her husband, she at first thought nothing of it and joined her friends for a swim. She took a shower, spoke to their son on the phone and dressed for dinner. It was only when she rejoined the group on the beach and realised no one had seen Goldberg for hours that panic set in. Racing to the resort gym, she found him lying on his back, his face blue, a pool of blood around his head. She performed frantic CPR, an ambulance rushed him to hospital, but it was too late. He had suffered a fatal heart attack. Sandberg flew home that evening to tell her children their father had died.
The news of Sandberg’s loss made global headlines, but held a particular resonance for my family. I knew what it was to fly away a happy couple and come home with a coffin, for our own beach holiday had shattered into tragedy 12 months earlier when my partner had drowned. As a member of what Sandberg calls “this club of ours no one ever wants to join”, I wasn’t surprised that she went back to work 10 days later – when every room in your house is haunted by memories, the longing for refuge is overwhelming. Nor was I surprised by the problem she was floored to find waiting for her at the office.
“You know, we were Facebook. We were very open. We sit at open desks and we share openly,” she tells me as we talk at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, in northern California. Sandberg doesn’t even have her own office at work, but sits among her colleagues in a vast open-plan space. “It’s part of who we are. We share. But everyone looked at me like I was a ghost. No one would talk to me.” She confided in her boss, Mark Zuckerberg: “All my relationships are gone, and no one will talk to me.” He told her, “They want to. They just don’t know what to say.”
In Jewish tradition, the mourning period for a spouse lasts for 30 days. As it drew to a close, Sandberg took a risk so out of character that even now she seems faintly amazed by herself. She wrote an unfiltered account of her grief-stricken month, and posted it publicly on Facebook.
“The night before, I thought, this is a terrible idea. This is too personal, too raw, there’s no way I’m posting this.” But when she woke the next morning, “I was like, this is supposed to be the end of mourning? I could not feel less like the end of mourning, this is horrible. And I said, you know, it’s not going to get worse, and I just hit post. And it broke open the dam.”
Sandberg’s post has attracted more than 74,000 comments to date. Strangers all over the world flooded her Facebook page with tales of their own tragedies and heartbreaks. “And you know,” she says, “after that, I didn’t feel alone any more.”

If something as simple as sharing stories could have such a radical impact on her grief, Sandberg wondered what else might. Why is it that some people never recover from loss, while others emerge with greater resilience to lead more meaningful lives? Working with a psychologist, Adam Grant, Sandberg studied the research of behavioural scientists, neurologists and psychologists for techniques empirically proven to build resilience. To her amazement, she discovered that by applying them all, she wouldn’t just recover but could actually achieve “post-traumatic growth”.
Option B, Sandberg and Grant’s book, is part personal memoir and part practical manual for how to withstand catastrophe and grow from adversity. She even claims it can deliver “pre-traumatic growth” for readers yet to suffer loss themselves, who fortify themselves with the lessons she has learned. Had I not yet read the book, this might sound to me like the laughable nonsense of California self-help. But Option B (named after the idea that if your Option A is taken away, you have to “kick the shit out of Option B”) is the single wisest book about grief I have ever found, and so useful that I only wish it had been in print three years ago. When I was widowed I would have stuck pages to my fridge, and sent it to relatives who wanted to help but didn’t know how, so cleared off rather than get it wrong. All we’d needed was a book spelling out how to help, when I was too broken to explain. I have tried to think of anyone who would not find Option B invaluable at some point in their life, and I can’t.
***
Facebook HQ lies 25 miles south of San Francisco, on a forgettable stretch of industrial estate flanked by a freeway. Whoever designed it went to some lengths to perfect an aggressively glamour-free aesthetic. The grey metal building is a quarter of a mile long, stands on top of a nine-acre car park and is accessed by squat silver buildings which look uncannily like the entrance lobbies found in Ikea car parks. The resemblance to Ikea does not end there. Each lobby is furnished by a reception that appears to have been knocked together in a hurry out of makeshift plywood, but on closer inspection turns out to be permanent. Stairs lead up to the first floor, where open-plan office space stretches as far as the eye can see and accommodates 2,500 staff. The interior looks half-finished – concrete floors, no ceiling to conceal the industrial tangle of electrical cables and ventilation flues overhead – but Facebook moved in two years ago, so this must be how it’s meant to look. Rows of identical white desks are punctuated by columns identified by numbers, like an Ikea warehouse, presumably to help staff find their way back. Facebook calls its HQ a campus, and it’s easy to see why, as I don’t spot anyone over 30 and everybody is dressed like an undergraduate. Sandberg’s desk is somewhere near the middle and looks like everyone else’s; we will meet in a big glass box, one of two meeting rooms and the only enclosed spaces I see.




 

I was not shocked by the anger, not shocked by the sadness. But the self-confidence blow completely surprised me




 

But no amount of gratuitous architectural austerity can distract from the power and wealth of this organisation, for most of which its COO is almost single-handedly responsible. Sandberg joined from Google in 2008 and turned Facebook from a popular tech startup that didn’t make money into one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. She comes to meet me straight after the photoshoot, looking like an Italian screen siren, all tiny birdlike limbs and big luxurious hair, and is shockingly beautiful. To my surprise she throws her arms around me and showers me in flattery. “I’m so glad you’re doing this interview,” she tells me, fixing a luminescent gaze. “Because you get it.”
In the early months after Goldberg’s death, Sandberg says she made the three classic mistakes – “the three ps – personalisation, pervasiveness and permanence”. She blamed herself for his death: “Especially because the early reports, which were false, said he died by falling off an exercise machine. So I absolutely thought that if I had looked for him sooner, he would be alive. A friend would say to me, ‘You didn’t leave a three-year-old alone in a gym.’ But I felt hugely guilty.” When the autopsy revealed undiagnosed coronary artery disease, “I spent months thinking I should have known that. I felt hugely guilty; you blame yourself endlessly. Then one day Adam [Grant] said, ‘If you do not recover, your kids cannot recover. That is it. You must.’ So that really snapped me out of it. I was like, OK, this isn’t my fault. I stopped taking it personally. 
“Then the pervasiveness. You don’t want to feel that anything’s good, as in, ‘Can I feel OK about work? How can I feel OK?’ Right, and then the permanence, and that for me was the hardest. It felt in the depths of grief that I would always feel sad. It would always feel that bad. And the sadness is still here, I still miss him every day, but it does not feel like it did in the beginning, when you can’t breathe. That’s why I shared so openly about the pain and the grief, because I think the only way people are going to think it gets better is if they know you feel what they were feeling.”
Sandberg writes about the moment she had to break the news to her children of their father’s death; “The screaming and crying that followed haunt me to this day. Nothing has come close to the pain of this moment. Even now when my mind wanders back, I shake and my throat constricts.” She studied research on how to raise resilient children, asked friends to make videos of themselves talking about their memories of Goldberg, filmed the children sharing their own memories of their father and played one of those films back to her daughter when she worried she was “forgetting Daddy because she has not seen him for so long”. On what would have been his 48th birthday, they wrote letters to him and sent them up in balloons.
She learned actively to seek out and treasure small moments of joy, and made it a habit to write down a list of three moments at the end of every day. “Writing about joyful experiences for just three days can improve people’s moods and decrease their visits to health centres a full three months later,” she reports in Option B – and having taken her advice and tried it, I can confirm it works. I almost winced with self-consciousness making my first entry – “Dancing with my son in a children’s nightclub” – but it makes me smile every time I read it. Another device she learned works, too: to make a list each night of three things she’d done well that day. In the early days hers were as modest as: Made tea. Got through all of my emails. Went to work and focused for most of one meeting. “But it really does work,” she says, “and everyone I know who’s tried it since then has told me it works. It absolutely works.”

She could never have guessed that rebuilding self-confidence would play such a big part in recovering from grief. “Well, that part was so interesting for me, right, because I’d thought a lot about self-confidence. I wrote an entire book on self-confidence. The Lean In community helps people get together to build self-confidence. Now, I had read about grief and I was not shocked by the anger, not shocked by the sadness. But the self-confidence blow completely surprised me.”
Confidence was not a commodity Sandberg had ever been short of before. Now she felt like a failure, both at work and at home. “I felt I could barely get through a meeting without thinking about Dave. And parenting is hard in the first place, but I had a partner and I had two kids with very happy childhoods. Then all of a sudden I had two grieving children and no partner and no experience. So my self-confidence completely crumbled.” What Sandberg needed, for the first time in her life, was praise.
When she made mistakes in the early weeks back at work, her colleagues would brush them off with, “How could you keep things straight with all you’re going through?” It was exactly what she had said herself in the past to anyone struggling with personal problems. Now she saw that, far from making her feel better, it only damaged her self-confidence further. She found out what actually helped when she panicked to Zuckerberg about something she’d got wrong, and he responded, “Really? I thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision.” Empathy, she writes, “was nice but encouragement was better”.
Another mistake she’d made before Goldberg died was to ask people in trouble, “Is there anything I can do?” She says, “I really meant it. But it kind of shifts the burden to the person who needs the help to tell you.” The classic inquiry, “How are you?” also turned out to be unhelpful. “Well, my husband just died on the floor of a gym. Like, how am I?” The more meaningful question, she learned, is “How are you today?”




 

Mark is why I’m walking. When I felt so isolated and just needed to cry, I would drag him into his conference room




 

But the biggest – and remarkably common – mistake is to ask nothing at all. “I want to talk about Dave. Bringing up Dave to me is always a positive. It doesn’t make me sad. I know he’s gone.” I ask if anyone has said they didn’t like to mention him as they didn’t want to “remind” her of her loss, and she laughs. “Yes. It’s not possible to remind me.” She recommends something she calls the platinum rule of friendship, “not to treat people as you want to be treated, but treat people as they want to be treated. That’s a pretty big mind shift, and some people do that quite naturally and some people don’t.”
To anyone who saw The Social Network, the film about Facebook’s origins which portrayed Zuckerberg as a socially awkward computer geek, this may come as a surprise, but the emotionally astute stand-out star of Option B is Sandberg’s boss. “Mark is why I’m walking. Most of what [he and his wife Priscilla] did is not even in the book, because they did so much. When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would drag him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me and be like, ‘We’re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you.’ He did it over and over.”

Sandberg says she likes the person loss has taught her to become, and prefers this new self to her old one. “I would definitely choose to be before, so I could get Dave back. I’d give up all the growth. But the deeper sense of meaning, gratitude, purpose – those things are wonderful things. My kids have unbelievable perspective. My son, they lost the basketball play-offs two weeks ago and all the other kids are pretty upset and my son looks at me and goes, ‘Mum, we’ve been through horrible things. This is sixth grade basketball. I’m good.’ He just had a birthday party because he’s going to turn 12. And the joy I feel in that, I never felt before. Before I thought it was obvious he would turn 12. Who doesn’t turn 12? But now I do not take that for granted. And that does, with all the pain, give your life much deeper meaning.”
I get the impression, though, that she is angrier than she cares to say. She writes about having struggled with anger, and when I ask how she managed her feelings towards loved ones she felt let her down, I’m struck by how she sidesteps the question. “I don’t know anyone who’s been through this who hasn’t had friends who disappointed them. I think we all go through that.” Has she lost friends? She looks uneasy. “There are people who I was close to and am now not as close to. Very few, but there’s a few.”
Ten months after being widowed, Sandberg began dating Bobby Kotick, an old friend and tech billionaire. A Facebook user posted that she was a “garbage whore”; another that she was “one classy lady” for “already sharing fluids with a new guy”. I ask how she feels about being judged, and glimpse a rare flash of uncamouflaged anger.
“I’m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged much more harshly. Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. And, you know, obviously that’s super unfair. I think I’m helping people remember that dating, for those who want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it is option B. If I could I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I just had that taken away from me.” I ask if her children have accepted her new partner and she says, “Yes yes,” but something in her expression closes the subject down.

Sandberg was not born into the executive super-rich. She grew up in Miami, comfortably middle class, the eldest of three children to an ophthalmologist father and a mother who taught French. A straight A student, she studied economics at Harvard before being hired by her thesis tutor, Larry Summers, to be his assistant at the World Bank. She returned to Harvard a year later, studied an MBA, graduated with distinction and was hired by the management consultants McKinsey before going to work for Summers in the White House. Her sole biographical failure, as she saw it, was a marriage at 24 to a Washington businessman which ended in divorce a year later.
She is without a doubt one of the most impressive women I’ve ever met. And yet there is something disconcerting about our conversation; a sense that we are impersonating intimacy. Beneath the surface something feels tightly controlled, strategically calculated. As our hour together comes to a close, I sense her attention starting to wander. The early intensity has gone; the luminescence is fading. She glances at the clock. I try to ask about Facebook but she stops me; we are to talk about the book, nothing else, and the shutters slam down. A few minutes later we hug goodbye, but before I leave, I’m taken aback when she asks, “So, what did I get wrong?”
What does she mean? “The book. Tell me what I got wrong.” I remember that Sandberg is famous for inviting feedback, so I tell her I wish she’d put more of herself into the book. She looks appalled. “No! Really?” Her editors, she groans, already extracted more from her than she meant to divulge; there is nothing left, she says, to tell.
But listening back to the interview tape afterwards, I’m struck by the deftness with which she evades inquiries that trespass from the path of the story she wants to tell. For example, she takes conspicuous care throughout Option B to acknowledge the wealth that protects her from difficulties most widows face. I ask if she did this because critics of Lean In accused her of appearing oblivious to the privileges that make her life unrecognisable to most women, but before I can finish the question she replies with statistics about single mothers’ poverty levels. When I ask if she’s concerned that the resentful register of contemporary identity politics will make it hard for some readers to find sympathy for a billionaire widow, she closes the question down with, “I think everyone deserves sympathy” and starts talking about a prison visit she made, and how prisoners deserve it, too, which is a different question altogether, and one she is far too clever to have confused with mine.
I leave in awe of Sandberg’s resolve to find a positive story to tell out of tragedy. But I also leave feeling unsettled by how carefully curated the whole encounter seemed. It takes days to place the feeling, and when I do it is perfectly obvious. It’s exactly the feeling I get when I look at profiles on Facebook. Perhaps that’s no surprise: Sandberg is a natural leader and problem solver – not merely Facebook’s COO but its living embodiment – who has dealt with her grief almost as if it were a failing business to be turned around; she studied the data, applied herself to its findings, and found the potential for growth.

  Sandberg (far right) with ‘the Girls’; ‘friends for life’ since school.


When I was 11, my best friend informed me that I wasn’t cool enough to hang out with. This hurtful breakup turned out to be a blessing. Soon after I was dumped, three girls picked me up. We became friends for life, adding three more to our circle in high school. Mindy, Eve, Jami, Elise, Pam and Beth – or, as we still call each other, “the Girls”. 
In the fall of 2015, Beth’s daughter was becoming a batmitzvah. Part of me didn’t want to go. Just days before my husband Dave died, we had picked a date for our son’s barmitzvah. The thought that Dave would not be at our own son’s ceremonial transition to adulthood cast a pall over the occasion. But during the dark days of that summer, the Girls had checked in daily. They took turns coming to California. By showing up again and again, they proved to me that I was not alone. I wanted to be there for them in the happy times, just as they’d been there for me in the sad.
Sitting with the Girls and their families at the service felt deeply comforting, almost as if I had been transported back to when we were teenagers. The ceremony ended with the traditional reciting of the prayer for those who have died. Six hands reached out to me. My friends held me tightly and we got through it together.
At the party that night, there were other guests from our Miami schooldays, including the cutest boy in our class: Brook Rose. Back then, none of us believed we had a chance with him, and after college he confirmed that when he told us he’s gay.
The DJ started playing September by Earth, Wind & Fire and Brook reached for my hand. He led me to the dancefloor and, just like high school, we let go, dancing and singing. Then I burst into tears. 
Brook quickly manoeuvred me to the outdoor patio and asked what was wrong. I assumed I was missing Dave, except I knew exactly what that felt like and somehow this was different. Then it dawned on me: dancing to a song from childhood had taken me to a place where I wasn’t filled with loneliness and longing. I actually felt happy. And that happiness was followed immediately by a flood of guilt. How could I be happy when Dave was gone?

  Sandberg (with glasses) with ‘the Girls’.


The next day, I told my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist, about my meltdown on the dancefloor. He wasn’t surprised. “Of course this was the first moment you were happy,” he told me. “You haven’t been doing a single thing that brings you joy.”
For more than four months since Dave died, I’d been completely focused on my kids, my job and just making it through each day. I had stopped doing anything Dave and I had done together for fun, such as going to movies, having dinner with friends, watching Game Of Thrones, or playing Settlers Of Catan or Scrabble. Catan was especially upsetting to me because Dave and I had been playing during our last moments while on holiday in Mexico to celebrate a friend’s birthday. There were plenty of reasons to hole up. I didn’t want to leave my kids with a babysitter. I was afraid that if I tried to go out, I’d end up crying in public. I had made one attempt to be social early that autumn. I invited friends over to watch a movie. We started the evening with frozen yoghurt and I kept thinking, you can do this. Pretend everything’s normal. A few minutes into the movie, the main character’s wife died. I thought the froyo was going to come back up. Everything was not normal.
In my Facebook post 30 days into widowhood, I wrote that I’d never have another moment of pure joy. When friends who had lost spouses assured me that some day I would feel happy again, I didn’t believe them. Then Earth, Wind & Fire proved me wrong. But the moment of happiness was fleeting, barely rearing its head before guilt whacked it back into its hole.
Survivor guilt is a thief of joy. When people lose a loved one, they are not just racked with grief, but also with remorse. “I could have saved her.” “Why am I the one who is still alive?” Even after acute grief is gone, the guilt remains. “I didn’t spend enough time with him.” 
Until that moment on the dancefloor, I did not realise I’d been holding myself back from happiness. Even that fleeting moment was ruined by guilt, making my prediction that I’d never feel pure joy again seem accurate. Then, one day, Dave’s brother Rob gave me a true gift. “Since the day Dave met you, all he ever wanted was to make you happy,” Rob told me, his voice choking up. “He would want you to be happy – even now. Don’t take that away from him.” My sister-in-law Amy helped, too, by making me see how much my mood affected my children. They had told her they were feeling better because “Mommy stopped crying all the time”.
With Rob’s and Amy’s words ringing in my ears, I decided to try having fun for my children – and with my children. Dave had loved playing Catan with our kids. One afternoon, I asked them if they wanted to play. They did. In the past, I was always orange. My daughter was blue. My son was red. Dave was grey. When just the three of us sat down to play, my daughter pulled out the grey pieces. My son got upset and tried to take them away from her, insisting, “That was Daddy’s colour. You can’t be grey!” I held his hand and said, “She can be grey. We take things back.”
“We take it back” became our mantra – rather than give up the things that reminded us of Dave, we embraced them. We took back rooting for the teams that Dave loved. We took back poker, which Dave had played with our kids since they were young.
For myself, I took back Game Of Thrones. It wasn’t nearly as much fun as watching with Dave, who had read the entire series of books and could track who was plotting against whom. But I caught up, and ended the season rooting for Khaleesi and her dragons. I started having friends over to watch movies, looking more carefully for ones in which no one loses a spouse. My best take-back was finding the perfect online Scrabble opponent. Dave and I had played together. Dave and Rob had played together. Now Rob and I play each other. In almost 100 games, I have beaten Rob a grand total of once. But now, for just a few minutes on our phones throughout the day, Rob and I are connected to each other… and to Dave.
Whether you see joy as a discipline, an act of defiance, a luxury or a necessity, it is something everyone deserves. Even when we’re in great distress, joy can still be found. Cooking. Dancing. Hiking. Praying. Driving. Singing Billy Joel songs off-key. And when these moments add up, we find that they give us more than happiness; they also give us strength.

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

She knows a thing or two
  about sustaining a successful business.

  As Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg knows a
  thing or two about sustaining a successful business.


  Like many other leading luminaries of the tech industry, she's a
  voracious reader who credits the habit with helping her achieve
  such stratospheric heights.


  "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries is a favorite
  she recommends to all entrepreneurs.


  Written to help new ventures develop sustainable business models
  quickly, this book advocates taking a scientific approach to
  building a business by continuously refining products based on
  feedback.


  If you're interested in ensuring your startup's success, these
  seven insights from "The Lean Startup" can keep your business on
  the right track.


  1. Focus the entire startup on a single goal


  As a startup, your primary goal is to find a profitable and
  sustainable business model. The faster you do that, the more
  likely you'll be to succeed. Start by focusing the entire company
  on finding out which products your potential customers want. Only
  after you've figured this out, should you try to translate
  customers' desire into dollars.


  2. Use validated learning to find and test your business model


  Your best bet for effectively selling the right product to the
  right people is by using a scientific approach known as validated
  learning. Begin by hypothesizing whether and how a certain
  product will be successful, then find out if people will actually
  buy it by offering it to them and observing their reactions.

  3. Develop a minimal viable product to test your idea in the
  market


  In order to quickly find out whether demand for your idea truly
  exists, create a minimal viable product (MVP) to collect
  meaningful feedback.


  This bare-bones version of your concept should only contain the
  essential components, but should be substantial enough to give
  potential customers a realistic product experience.


  4. Build, measure, learn as fast as possible


  After creating a prototype of your product, establish a
  build-measure-learn (BML) loop to continuously improve upon it.


  Gather authentic feedback on your prototype, and, based on what
  you learn, conceptualize and construct an improved version.


  Rinse and repeat as rapidly as possible to find your optimal
  business model more quickly.


  5. Use split-testing to optimize your idea


  To help you determine which of your product's features customers
  find valuable — and which they don't — create two versions of
  your concept: one with a new feature and one without it. This
  type of split-testing makes it easy to see which version
  customers prefer, helping you decide which features to keep — and
  which to ditch.


  6. Be prepared to pivot


  If your initial hypothesis isn't playing out as planned, it might
  be time for a pivot. This fundamental change of course might mean
  redefining your core values, targeting a different customer
  segment, or choosing a new sales channel. Making the decision to
  pivot isn't easy, but many successful startups have done so, and
  it shouldn't be avoided.


  7. Concentrate on your current customers


  While it might be tempting for startups to pursue new customers
  at all costs, a safer strategy is to get current customers to use
  your product increasingly often. By regularly offering new
  features or providing new services, your current advocates will
  become more vocal, making it more likely your product will go
  viral.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Most Valuable Friend

PALO ALTO, Calif.EVERY Monday a bit before 10 a.m., Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, dashes off a quick e-mail to her boss, Mark Zuckerberg. “We have a routine,” Ms. Sandberg says. “I e-mail, ‘Coming in?’ He replies, ‘On my way.’ ”A few minutes later, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, walks into the company’s headquarters here, says a few hellos and heads to a conference room where he and Ms. Sandberg huddle for an hour. The two executives end the week the same way, with a closed-door meeting on Friday afternoon. They discuss products, strategy, deals, personnel — and each other.“We agreed that we would give each other feedback every Friday,” Ms. Sandberg says. “We are constantly flagging things. Nothing ever builds up.” At a recent meeting, for instance, they ironed out a disagreement between them over the details of Mr. Zuckerberg’s pledge to give $100 million to schools in Newark.If all of that sounds a bit touchy-feely, well, it is. Ms. Sandberg, a well-regarded Internet executive, is known for her interpersonal skills as much as for her sharp intellect. And her regular meetings with the famously introverted Mr. Zuckerberg have helped to keep one of Silicon Valley’s most unusual business partnerships working wonders for Facebook.

Indeed, for a variety of reasons, Ms. Sandberg may well have become Mr. Zuckerberg’s most valuable friend. Continue reading the main story

Since Ms. Sandberg joined the company more than two years ago, Facebook has successfully navigated one of the more perilous stages in a start-up’s life: a period of hypergrowth. Facebook’s work force has expanded sixfold, to nearly 1,800, and its global audience has multiplied by more than seven, to half a billion. Revenue, once little more than an afterthought, is expected to balloon to around $1.6 billion this year,  according to estimates from Wedbush Securities. (Facebook, a private company, doesn’t disclose its revenue.)Part of the reason for that sales growth is Ms. Sandberg’s close ties to many of the world’s largest advertisers, relationships she first developed as a senior executive at Google. Ms. Sandberg also brought stability to Facebook, which had suffered from a long period of turmoil and the departure of several executives and early employees, including the company’s other co-founders.“One of the reasons the company is doing so well is because the two of them get along so well,” says Mike Schroepfer, vice president for engineering.Ms. Sandberg  has focused on building the business, expanding internationally, cultivating relationships with large advertisers and putting her polish on things like communications and public policy. That has freed Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on what he likes best: the Facebook Web site and its platform.Donald Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Company, who once tried to hire Ms. Sandberg, says that in the last two years a lot of questions about Facebook’s viability have been put to rest.“The combination of Mark and Sheryl is the primary reason,” says Mr. Graham, who is also a member of Facebook’s board.These days, Ms. Sandberg is also juggling another duty: mounting a defense of Mr. Zuckerberg at a time when a new movie, “The Social Network,” portrays him as an aloof and conniving student who may have stolen the idea for Facebook from others. Ms. Sandberg will have none of that.

“He is shy and introverted and he often does not seem very warm to people who don’t know him, but he is warm,” Ms. Sandberg says of Mr. Zuckerberg, her voice rising with empathy. “He really cares about the people who work here.”She can be just as protective of Mr. Zuckerberg in private.At a technology conference this summer, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg flopped during an onstage interview. He gave rambling answers to questions about Facebook’s privacy policies, became visibly nervous and started sweating profusely. After the interview, Ms. Sandberg encouraged him not to beat himself up over it, but to focus on parts of the interview that went well so he could do better next time, according to people briefed on their interaction who didn’t want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

“She really wants him to succeed,” says one of these people.For all her achievements, there’s one area where Ms. Sandberg’s influence has yet to work its magic: privacy concerns. While Ms. Sandberg is not ultimately responsible for the features on the Facebook site — that’s Mr. Zuckerberg’s job — she is deeply involved in the planning that revolves around them. She readily acknowledges that Facebook has made mistakes.“It is completely fair to say that we have had our challenges around privacy,” she says.Ms. Sandberg says that Facebook built powerful privacy controls, but that they became too complicated for the average user. Facebook recently simplified those settings. “Mark took the step to apologize,” about the privacy problems, she notes.But some critics say the privacy issue goes beyond how easily users understand Facebook’s settings. For example, they note, Facebook collects increasing amounts of personal information from users to help marketers fine-tune their messages.“I fear that Ms. Sandberg is failing to provide the adult supervision that Facebook requires,” says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group based in Washington. “Facebook’s direction regarding its use of its member data, and the viral and largely stealth marketing practices it endorses, is very disturbing.”A spokesman for Facebook said the site lets users control what information they want to share and with whom, and makes it clear how the information may be used in its advertising products. Facebook never sells that information to third parties, the spokesman said.MARK ZUCKERBERG and Sheryl Sandberg may well be Silicon Valley’s oddest couple.Mr. Zuckerberg, a 26-year-old engineer and product visionary, is socially awkward and reserved. At 41, Ms. Sandberg is the opposite: polished, personable, chatty and at ease in the limelight.

The differences don’t end there. Mr. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to focus on building Facebook, and has never worked anywhere else. Ms. Sandberg, who has a Harvard M.B.A., is a veteran of Google, where she had a central role in building the largest, most successful advertising business on the Internet.By the time she left Google, her unit had grown from a handful of people to about 4,000 employees, or about one-quarter of Google’s total, and it accounted for more than half  of the company’s revenue. She also helped to establish Google’s philanthropic arm and ran operations for a collection of unrelated projects, like Google’s book-scanning operations.Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, says he considers Ms. Sandberg to be a “superstar.” But there is growing tension between the two companies, in part because Ms. Sandberg has recruited a string of former Google executives and employees. About 200 ex-Googlers are now working at Facebook.

Before coming to Silicon Valley in 2001, Ms. Sandberg earned a degree in economics and then her M.B.A. from Harvard, did stints at the World Bank and at McKinsey & Company, and then worked as chief of staff for Lawrence H. Summers when he was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration.Despite their obvious differences — or maybe because of them — Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have grown close. “A lot of people choose to hire people who look exactly like them,” Mr. Zuckerberg says. “Here we just value balance a lot more. It takes work to build those relationships, but if it does work, you end up with a much better system.”Mr. Zuckerberg met Ms. Sandberg at a Christmas party in 2007, and they immediately took a liking to each other. What followed was an intense, six-week business courtship, during which the two dined together multiple times a week. Because both of them are Silicon Valley celebrities, they typically ate at Ms. Sandberg’s house so they could keep their talks confidential.“We were very methodical and thoughtful about the relationship,” says Ms. Sandberg.For his part, Mr. Zuckerberg, ever the tech geek, describes their interactions as “high-bandwidth.”“We can talk for 30 seconds and have more meaning be exchanged than in a lot of meetings that I have for an hour,” he says. Ms. Sandberg might give him a quick update on, say, the development of Facebook’s offices in Ireland or India.“I make sure that I understand the basic things that we are doing,” says Mr. Zuckerberg. But, he adds, he trusts that anything Ms. Sandberg handles will run smoothly. “The dynamic on the management team,” he says, “has improved a huge amount since she joined.”

Outside the company, Ms. Sandberg spends much of her time with advertisers. Last week,  for example, she crisscrossed Manhattan, where she gave a keynote speech at an Advertising Week conference and met in private with various large advertisers.

Ms. Sandberg also oversees the seemingly arcane operational details that can help a company run smoothly — especially a company that is growing rapidly.She recently sat down with Pedram Keyani, an engineer whose team builds the tools that handle complaints and requests from Facebook’s users. Mr. Keyani said Ms. Sandberg met with his small group to understand the challenges it faced, and later reorganized it to run more smoothly.“She operates at every level,” Mr. Keyani says. “She’s good at strategy and dives deep and understands how teams work together.”THE embrace of Ms. Sandberg by Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook’s 20-something rank-and-file was not preordained. When she was hired, a frat-house atmosphere permeated the company, according to many early employees, and technology blogs speculated that she had been brought in to clean up the place.To this day, Ms. Sandberg looks a bit out of place at Facebook. She sits in a cluster of desks that includes Mr. Zuckerberg’s as well as those of other engineering and product executives. Their penchant for jeans, T-shirts and hoodies is in sharp contrast to her taste for elegant clothing. Her own staff, which handles most of Facebook’s business functions, works in another building a few blocks away.Her efforts to win over the Facebook troops began on her first day. She went desk to desk to introduce herself, cracking jokes and asking questions. It had the desired effect.“She’s legit,” says Christopher Cox, a confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg and the company’s vice president for product. “She’s not like a robot M.B.A. The people who get rejected here are the people who come here and say all these M.B.A. words like ‘synergy.’ ”

Ms. Sandberg earned a reputation for mentoring many younger employees — especially women, encouraging many of them not to shy away from important roles simply because they were planning to start families. Ms. Sandberg can speak to that topic from experience: she is married to Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey, a maker of software for online surveys, and the couple have two young children.Whenever anyone on her side of the company is promoted, she sends a  congratulatory note.People who have known Ms. Sandberg a long time say they are not surprised by her success. As a Harvard undergraduate, she sat near the back of an economics class taught by Mr. Summers. He says he didn’t pay much attention to her until she turned in the best midterm examination in her class — and then the best final.Mr. Summers became her thesis adviser and later hired her to work with him at the World Bank and at the Treasury Department. Although she was still in her 20s, she played pivotal roles, like helping ramp up aid efforts to Africa by opening Treasury’s door to Bono of U2.“I had never heard of him and said to Sheryl that I only meet with people who have a first name and last name,” Mr. Summers recalls. At Ms. Sandberg’s urging, he finally agreed. Debt relief in Africa “wouldn’t have happened if she hadn’t insisted I meet Bono and persevered on this issue,” says Mr. Summers.MS. SANDBERG’S connection with Mr. Zuckerberg runs especially deep. The two often socialize, and Mr. Zuckerberg, who was captain of his high school fencing team, has taught Ms. Sandberg’s 5-year-old son a few fencing moves.When Mr. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, his longtime girlfriend, started thinking about philanthropy, they turned to Ms. Sandberg. She immediately tapped her vast network of contacts and organized meetings with the likes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Michelle A. Rhee, the schools chief in Washington, D.C.Ms. Sandberg “helped me navigate the politics of it and to figure out where I could have the most leverage,” Mr. Zuckerberg says. “That she was the person that Priscilla and I turned to is a strong symbol of our relationship.”

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]

In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

How Sheryl Sandberg’s Sharing Manifesto Drives Facebook
The COO inspires her fans, and her employees, to talk about sadness, even tragedy, at work. That can be healing—and very good for business.

On the last day in January, about two dozen prolific users of Facebook were invited to the social network’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. There, they were arranged in a circle of brightly colored chairs to meet Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s second-highest-ranking executive and the Oprah of corporate America. The guests, who had made life-changing friendships using an organizational tool called Facebook Groups, were invited to ask Sandberg questions. She insisted that she had to hear their stories first.That’s when the tears started flowing. A woman talked about how a Facebook post on her struggle to become a mother led her to adopt a foster child; two women from opposite coasts discussed how they’d become close by starting a private group to help women of color navigate mental health issues; and a Dallas waiter who’d lost his leg because of a rare bone disease talked about meeting a man who’d helped him raise money to try out for a soccer team for the disabled. Sandberg, dressed in a loose white sweater, jeans, and boots, California quiet-luxury style, leaned in over and over to listen, offering words of encouragement and hugs. “I love this,” she told them. After the sudden death of her husband, David Goldberg, two years ago, she was comforted to know that Facebook was helping others cope with their own hardships.As they talked, cameras and boom mics followed; members of the press looked on from the edge of the room. The publicized event was in celebration of Friends Day, a Facebook-conceived holiday with all the authenticity of greeting card company concoctions like “Grandparents Day.” But really it was just another normal morning at Facebook Inc., where employees are generally encouraged to share their personal challenges with colleagues. Nor would the event have been out of place in the emotionally well-adjusted atmosphere that now characterizes many corporate cultures, thanks in large part to Sandberg herself.


On Friends Day, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, also enthusiastically joined the festivities, but when guests were asked for the highlight of the trip—dinner out in Palo Alto or the session where they got to give product advice?—one woman quickly answered, “Getting a selfie with Sheryl.”Sandberg’s message of openness and empathy may come across as a self-serving schtick. Facebook’s COO encouraging people to overshare is like Exxon Mobil promoting oil. But since she’s one of the most powerful women in business, you can’t just dismiss her as the Chief Emoting Officer. There’s what Sandberg’s accomplished at Zuckerberg’s side—the company is, with a market value of $425 billion, the world’s fifth-largest, and affects the daily lives of its almost 2 billion users. There’s also her harder-to-quantify role as this decade’s leading culture shifter in the long slog toward a corporate reality in which winning doesn’t require posing as a man.Decades ago, pioneering feminists like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem pointed out that compartmentalizing domestic and professional spheres was a way for men to stay in charge. Because women can’t hide the fact that they’re pregnant or breast-feeding, simply being female looked unprofessional. And as long as problems related to child care and other forms of domestic labor—traditionally the purview of women—weren’t seen as work, public policies would never change and women would never become part of political decision-making.The foremothers of today’s female CEOs organized women to become a vocal force asserting that their issues were collective ones, but over the years the pace of change slowed. Sandberg, in her blockbuster best-seller Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead (co-written by Nell Scovell) and through her nonprofit LeanIn.org, picked up the thread, encouraging women to get together online and in person to share the struggles and feelings involved in bridging those still-present divides. Sandberg’s central management message was a compelling one: “Bring your whole self into work.” She’d conveyed this inspirational koan in a commencement address to Harvard Business School, her alma mater, in 2012, the year before the book was published. The slightly paradoxical idea was for women to drop their professional facades and convey vulnerability to better connect with colleagues and customers, while at the same time acting with the confidence needed to rise in the workplace.Now, with the publication of a new instructional memoir, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, Sandberg has taken that cause even further, moving workday anguish over setbacks such as divorce, disease, and death from solo crying jags in the office parking lot to company hallways, conference rooms, and boardrooms.


After Sandberg became a widow and the single mother of a grade-school-age son and daughter, she was vulnerable in a way she couldn’t control. “If I believed before Dave died in bringing your whole self to work, what I learned after Option B is you have no choice,” she says during an interview at Facebook. “When your whole self is going through adversity and tragedy, that whole self comes to work.”In the book, co-written with Wharton School professor and TED Talk superstar Adam Grant, she weaves her family’s story of loss with academic data on recovery from tragedy and with anecdotes from others facing cancer, disability, or mental illness. The title refers to a conversation Sandberg had with her friend Phil Deutch, a managing partner at an energy fund. As she recounts in the first chapter, called “Breathing Again,” he offered to fill in for Goldberg at a father-child school activity. “But I want Dave,” Sandberg writes. Deutch put his arm around her and said, “Option A is not available. So let’s kick the shit out of Option B.” Back at work, motivational posters encouraging people to “kick the shit out of option B” went up all over the sprawling campus.Two friends gave Sandberg chains on which to string her husband’s wedding ring; she melded them and wears the necklace daily.Photographer: Mark Peterson for Bloomberg BusinessweekSandberg doesn’t have an office in the den of transparency that is Facebook, but she does have a personal conference room, a glass-walled case with a table, right in the middle of all the standing desks and modernist furniture. On a recent Tuesday between meetings, she uses a spare moment as many workers do: checking for comments on her most recent Facebook post, an announcement of the upcoming book. Unlike most people, she has thousands to wade through.One comment jumps out at her, from a woman who says her husband died a week after Goldberg passed away. “She went back to work after 10 days because I did,” Sandberg says, folding her hands over her chest while seated in her conference room. “I would never want anyone to lose their husband at 47. Ever. But given that it happened, isn’t it incredible that I feel connected to her? After the post this morning, I feel less alone.”Sandberg exudes such intense sincerity when she talks that it can come across as manufactured. Her eyes fix on listeners as she takes them through data, a vignette, and a handy concluding sentence—exactly the package they need to convey it to someone else. Her tone is one you’d use talking to a close girlfriend, though her sentences end with her voice falling, which underscores the seriousness of what she’s saying. Her conversations incorporate calculated pauses that provide opportunities to absorb her message. She’s disciplined, too. Even when she’s telling recycled stories and jokes, friends and colleagues who’ve heard them before marvel that she can deliver them with fresh emotion and impact.Sandberg contends that she’s almost an accidental prophet of openness in the workplace. A decade ago, as an executive at Google Inc., she always worked from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Then her first child was born, and she found she couldn’t stand coming home to find him already asleep. She started sneaking out of the office early, sometimes placing a decoy jacket on her chair, leaving the light on at her desk, or scheduling afternoon meetings in other buildings so her colleagues wouldn’t see her leave. The subterfuge continued for years. Then in 2012, about a month before Facebook’s initial public offering, she admitted to a reporter that she regularly left work at 5:30.


The revelation blared across multiple news outlets. Sandberg was worried that she would be lectured or fired. Instead, her brazenness was heralded by other female professionals. The women of the legal team at Yahoo! Inc. sent her flowers with a card saying that they, too, were leaving at 5:30. “I didn’t realize how much noise there would be,” Sandberg says. “A friend told me, ‘You couldn’t have gotten more publicity if you murdered someone with an ax.’ ” (This was in the innocent days before Facebook Live, the streaming video service, was used by murderers for PR.)When she submitted the Lean In manuscript to editors later that year, they told her that the first draft was boring. It was all data and research, with nothing about her own challenges navigating the workplace obstacle course of gender expectations and entrenched sexism. Goldberg told her nobody would read it if she didn’t put herself into it. She began rewriting. Sandberg says she didn’t want to overshare, but apparently the market was demanding it.When Goldberg died, she regretted the fame the book had brought her. “If I could have gone back and rewritten Lean In, I would have, because I didn’t want to live publicly,” she says. “But then it was so isolating.” People avoided her gaze. Interactions became stilted. She confided to Zuckerberg that she felt as though her workplace friendships were melting away. One night before bed, she wrote a 1,700-word explanation of what she was going through and how she hoped people would interact with her. It started as a cathartic exercise. She didn’t think she would publish it, but when she woke up, she changed her mind and put it on Facebook. In Lean In, Sandberg had admitted to crying at work (another confession the media jumped on), but this was the first time she’d shared anything so deeply personal. The post received 74,000 comments, many from co-workers acknowledging her struggle.Of course, one could argue that Sandberg had begun down this path the moment she joined Facebook—a company that earns billions from getting people to open up about their lives. She and Zuckerberg have frequently been asked to lead by example. When Facebook lifted a tactic from Twitter and gave public figures the option of opening their profiles to people who weren’t friends but followers, “I wasn’t going to do it, and neither was Mark,” Sandberg says. Then a communications executive, Caryn Marooney, told them they would have to do it if they wanted others to fall in line. “I think the product has really changed us,” Sandberg says earnestly. Zuckerberg gives her a lot of credit, too. “When Sheryl first came to Facebook, she started a tradition of checking-in to our leadership meetings,” he wrote in an email. “Checking-in” means each person around the table is invited to discuss their current emotional and professional state before they get down to business. “Nine years later, we’re still doing it.”In 2014, Sandberg hosted an all-hands meeting to talk about the connection between sharing personal stories and working at a place like Facebook. She talked at length about the company’s culture and how employees were individually charged with serving its mission “to make the world more open and connected.” Then she introduced some employees, whom she now describes as “a bunch of people who went onstage and shared a lot of really personal stuff, things they’d gone through and how Facebook connected to it.”One employee who got the message was Stephanie Latham, a marketing director who coordinates Facebook’s relationship with the auto industry and had just relocated to Menlo Park when she found out she had cancer and was pregnant. Reluctant to post about her personal life, she told only her team, so they could prepare for her unpredictable schedule. Soon after, a group of her co-workers, including some she didn’t know, produced a video for her, set to Pharrell Williams’s Happy. Latham was moved to tears.News of the video reached Sandberg, who encouraged Latham to share her story at Facebook’s internal Women’s Leadership Day conference. “That was way out of my comfort zone, but I felt like it was a necessary thing to do,” Latham says in an interview.The episode sounds like a scene from The Circle, the best-selling thriller by Dave Eggers that’s just been released as a feature film starring Emma Watson. In it, employees at a Facebook-like company are svengalied into making their lives and emotions transparent, as a precursor to totalitarian thought control. But in real life, Latham’s story didn’t end in treachery and murder; it just went viral on the company’s internal network. Responses from colleagues were accompanied by the hashtag #FBFamily, which was later printed on blue rubber wristbands and passed around campus. Latham, now cancer-free with a healthy daughter, credits Sandberg for helping her find a supportive community at work. “She leads so strongly by example,” Latham says.Ample sharing among colleagues is inculcated in employees from the second they walk in the door. New hires are invited by the HR department to a Facebook group of their peers and are expected to befriend one another and members of their future teams. Collaboration among all employees occurs on Facebook Groups. Milestones and failures are publicized on the network, as well as “Faceversaries”—anniversaries of workers’ start dates. These are hallowed events, acknowledged like birthdays, with hundreds of celebratory posts from colleagues and a note from the employee reflecting on what he or she has learned, while tagging the bosses and co-workers who made it all possible.“After the post this morning, I feel less alone”Many workers find the approach freeing. In February 2016 an engineering director named David Ferguson posted to the global Facebook employee network an explanation of why, the following Monday, she would arrive as a woman and go by the name Deb. In September, Oscar Perez, a diversity director who posts about life as a gay Latino, shared thoughts about the day his father became a U.S. citizen. “You think it would waste time, to sit around and talk about your life, but it doesn’t,” says Sandberg. “It actually saves time, because it’s so present for people that having an opportunity to talk about it actually helps.”Facebook celebrates the values of transparency and personal sharing with the exuberance of a company that knows it might be very good for business. But the Sandberg effect is now showing up at places that don’t capitalize on the human urge to communicate. Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors Co., posts on Facebook about issues such as female empowerment. Another close Sandberg friend, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. CEO Doug McMillon, responds to customer complaints on the social network with his personal email address. This year he became the first chief executive to be featured in one of the retail giant’s commercials. (“The reason I share? I’m proud of the people I work with.”)It’s Sandberg-inspired postmodern marketing—a corporate attempt to strengthen bonds with customers via an abundance of sharing that in a prior era might have seemed unbecoming. “It makes us trust them more, or at a minimum, know them more, and that’s good for loyalty over time,” says Mike Hoefflinger, a former Facebook employee who wrote a book about the social network.“This younger generation really craves this authenticity, this vulnerability,” explains Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. She sees Sandberg as far ahead of the game. “When I hang out with these most powerful women, particularly in tech, they’re just like machines,” she says, recounting a time she overheard two female executives compare recent results of blood tests to measure their testosterone levels. Among the regular churn of leadership books, a more recent set has emerged promising to teach authenticity and touting research showing that those in upper management who master it will have more sway.Sandberg employs this soft power even in her conversations with Wall Street. Before Facebook’s earnings reports are published, her team helps her gather compelling anecdotes from advertisers that take advantage of the company’s user-targeting tools. She keeps the stories in a list beside her, to use as examples on the investor call that accompanies the quarterly release. “I’m doing that on purpose on earnings calls and in all my communication, because stories are what help us understand things,” she says.In Facebook’s Frank Gehry-designed Building 20; Sandberg posts openly about her life and asks colleagues to bring their “whole self” to work.Photographer: Mark Peterson for Bloomberg BusinessweekIf the company’s new product, Workplace, succeeds, Sandbergian management will have proven to be scalable. Various Silicon Valley startups have tried to create versions of Facebook for work; Slack Technology Inc., the creator of a popular office messaging service, is now valued at $3.8 billion. Facebook’s answer provides an office-friendly version of its standard news feed—and a justification for employees to spend even more time on the network. Early adopters include Starbucks, Viacom, and the government of Singapore.The attention Sandberg’s book is getting comes at a good time for Facebook. The company has arrived at a moment when it desperately needs to be humanized—when, now unimaginably large and influential, it’s under assault on a number of fronts, for how criminals use Facebook Live, for enabling the proliferation of extremism, and for elevating fake news, which some critics blame for the election of Donald Trump.During Barack Obama’s presidency, Silicon Valleyites were comfortably ensconced with the liberal elite; suddenly, they’re being cast as H-1B-visa-abusing, terrorist-enabling globalists. Sandberg, who supported Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy, demurred in 2016 when asked if she would accept a political appointment from the first female commander-in-chief, but there was speculation she might be nudged. This year looked like an Option B for Sandberg politically, too, and she’s not kicking the shit out of it. After she failed to write about the Women’s March protests, a local tech blog, Pando Daily, penned a scathing post, charging that her silence was evidence that Facebook was “bending over backwards to embrace a Donald Trump world.” Sandberg later conceded that she should have posted about the event; then she sent a donation to Planned Parenthood.


Asked how she decides what to post publicly, she says, “I care about the issues I care about. I care about women. I care about resilience. It’s like anyone else.” She spends more time on the posts about “big stuff,” like one she did for Mother’s Day the year after Goldberg died, in which she talked about criticisms Lean In had received for its assumption that all women could lean in, neglecting to sufficiently address the reality of, for instance, solo mothers with low-wage jobs. Now, she explained, she’s painfully aware that, even with plenty of money and help, being a single mother makes leaning in hard. With the publication of the new book, Sandberg is prepared for fresh criticism, this time for her personal choices. Tabloids are already commenting on her dating life. Everyone has a different idea about how someone should grieve, she says.Sandberg has been at Facebook for nine years—“a long time for anyone to be anywhere,” she says. But even though her name is frequently associated with high-level roles, such as Walt Disney Co. CEO or California senator, she says she’s not going anywhere. Her argument is, as always, deployed with data and a handy vignette. Research shows that after experiencing a death, it’s common for people to want to do something meaningful with their lives, she says. She thinks her work at Facebook is more meaningful than ever.And in a sense, the company is a kind of wealthy nation-state unto itself—one that might grant her more influence than she would have as a politician. Alongside encouraging warm, open conversation among employees, she and Zuckerberg have implemented longer bereavement plans and more flex time for coping with life tragedies, policies which, if they spread to other companies, would offer a tangible payoff for all this job-mandated vulnerability. “I work on something I really believe in with my best friend. I think I’m doing this,” she says of her intention to stay put. “I don’t know how many times to say it.”

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
Other work and ventures[edit]
In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[4] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. She is the chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook and founder of Leanin.org (also known as the Lean In Foundation). In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members,[5] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before she joined Facebook as its COO, Sandberg was vice president of global online sales and operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for United States Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers.
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[6] As of June 2015[update], Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[7][8]

Early life and education[edit]
Sandberg was born in 1969 in Washington, D.C. to a Jewish family,[9] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[4][10] Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother was a college teacher of French language.[9] Adele taught English as a second language and founded Ear Peace-Save Your Hearing, a nonprofit that teaches teens how to prevent hearing loss.[11] She dropped out of a Ph.D. program when she was pregnant with Sheryl and concentrated on raising her children.[12][13] Sheryl's maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn, grew up in a poor family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during the Great Depression, went on to community college, graduated from U.C. Berkeley, and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[14][15][16] Sandberg's family was active in helping Soviet Jews make aliyah to Israel during the refusenik era and attended rallies during the weekends.[11][17][18] In 1975, Adele and Joel were detained and interrogated in Kishinev and later expelled from the USSR.[19] Sheryl and her siblings had Soviet Bar and Bat Mitzvah "twins" (who were called to the Torah during their ceremonies, as they could not have their own in the Soviet Union); Sheryl's was a penpal named Kira Volvovskaya.[20]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was 2 years old.[9] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class", and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[9][11] She was sophomore class president, became a member of the National Honor Society, and was on the senior class executive board.[11] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[21]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College. She graduated in 1991 summa cum laude Phi Beta Kappa[22] with a bachelor's degree in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[23] While at Harvard, she co-founded an organization called Women in Economics and Government.[11] She met then-professor Larry Summers, who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[24] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[9] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[25]
In 1993, she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her MBA with highest distinction.[23] In her first year of business school, she earned a fellowship.[26]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001 she again worked for Larry Summers, who was then serving as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Sandberg assisted in the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[25]
When the Republicans gained the US Presidency in November 2000, Sandberg left her job. She then moved to Silicon Valley in 2001 and joined Google Inc., serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008.[27] She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[28]
Facebook[edit]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig.[9] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[9] In March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sandberg away from Google for the role of COO.[29]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[9] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[9] According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, and communications.[30]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.[31]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about $1 billion.[32]
Boards[edit]
In 2009 Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[33] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[30] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[34] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.

In 2008 Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[35] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[36] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[37] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[38] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[39] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[40] In 2015 she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[41]
Lean In[edit]
Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013.
It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[42][43][44][45][46][47] As of the fall of 2013, the book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[48]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.[49] Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.


“
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[50]
”


Criticism of the book include claims that Sandberg is "too elitist" and another that she is "tone-deaf" to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace.[51][52] Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is "acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families"[53] and that her intention was to "offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook."[54]
Ban Bossy[edit]
Main article: Ban Bossy
In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the controversial Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media censorship advocacy campaign designed to ban the word bossy from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, and Condoleezza Rice among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.[55][56][57]
Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation[edit]
In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for LeanIn.Org and a new organization around her book, Option B. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in Facebook stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.[58]
Personal life[edit]
Sandberg first married at age 24 and divorced a year later. In 2004, she married Dave Goldberg, then an executive with Yahoo! and later CEO of SurveyMonkey.[4][48][59] The couple has a son and a daughter.[60] Sandberg and Goldberg frequently discussed being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage.[61] Sandberg also raised the issue of single parenting conflicting strongly with professional and economic development in America.[62]
On May 1, 2015, Dave Goldberg died unexpectedly and his death was originally reported as resulting from sustaining a head trauma falling from a treadmill while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.[63][64] Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's cause of death was due to an arrhythmia and not due to falling from a treadmill.[65]
Sandberg lives in Menlo Park, California.[1][66]

Sheryl Sandberg Quotes

American
-
Businesswoman

Born: August 28, 1969










































   Loading...






We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests.
Sheryl Sandberg


Work,
Progress,
Passion



















Until women are as ambitious as men, they're not gong to achieve as much as men.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Men,
Achieve
























It is the ultimate luxury to combine passion and contribution. It's also a very clear path to happiness.
Sheryl Sandberg


Happiness,
Passion,
Path



















I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with, all these fabulous women, 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.' I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple.
Sheryl Sandberg


Work,
Success,
Women



















So there's no such thing as work-life balance. There's work, and there's life, and there's no balance.
Sheryl Sandberg


Life,
Work,
Balance



















If more women are in leadership roles, we'll stop assuming they shouldn't be.
Sheryl Sandberg


Leadership,
Women,
Stop



















If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, 'I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking?' If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Good,
Job



















I feel really grateful to the people who encouraged me and helped me develop. Nobody can succeed on their own.
Sheryl Sandberg


Grateful,
People,
Me



















Women attribute their success to working hard, luck, and help from other people. Men will attribute that - whatever success they have, that same success - to their own core skills.
Sheryl Sandberg


Success,
Women,
Men
























What about the rat race in the first place? Is it worthwhile? Or are you just buying into someone else's definition of success? Only you can decide that, and you'll have to decide it over and over and over. But if you think it's a rat race, before you drop out, take a deep breath. Maybe you picked the wrong job. Try again. And then try again.
Sheryl Sandberg


Success,
Deep,
Job



















I really think we need more women to lean into their careers and to be really dedicated to staying in the work force.
Sheryl Sandberg


Work,
Women,
Think



















I have never worked for a woman, and I have never worked with a lot of women.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Woman,
Never



















I would be better at my job if I were technical.
Sheryl Sandberg


Job,
Better,
Would



















It's easy to dislike the few senior women out there. What if women were half the positions in power? It would be harder to dislike all of them.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Power,
Easy



















When you're more valuable, the people around you will do more to make it work.
Sheryl Sandberg


Work,
People,
You
























I go around the room and ask people, 'What do you think?'
Sheryl Sandberg


People,
Think,
You



















For any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Today,
Choices



















Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state; nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, thirteen per cent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top - C-level jobs, board seats - tops out at fifteen, sixteen per cent.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
World,
People



















Most people assume that women are responsible for households and child care. Most couples operate that way - not all. That fundamental assumption holds women back.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Child,
Care



















The No. 1 impediment to women succeeding in the workforce is now in the home.
Sheryl Sandberg


Home,
Women,
Now



















We've got to get women to sit at the table.
Sheryl Sandberg


Women,
Sit,
Table



















I have a five year-old son and a three year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home. And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.
Sheryl Sandberg


Home,
Daughter,
Son
























What I tell everyone, and I really do for myself is, I have a long-run dream, which is I want to work on stuff that I think matters.
Sheryl Sandberg


Work,
Myself,
Dream



















But I really believe that when you give people authentic identity, which is what Facebook does, and you can be your real self and connect with real people online, things will change.
Sheryl Sandberg


Change,
Self,
Believe



















In fact, my New Year's resolution every year, and I'm Jewish so I get two New Years a year, is to meditate, and I fail every time.
Sheryl Sandberg


Time,
New,
Two



















We call our little girls bossy. Go to a playground; little girls get called bossy all the time - a word that's almost never used for boys - and that leads directly to the problems women face in the workforce.
Sheryl Sandberg


Time,
Women,
Problems

							About the talk








Sheryl Sandberg admits she was terrified to step onto the TED stage in 2010 — because she was going to talk, for the first time, about the lonely experience of being a woman in the top tiers of business. Millions of views (and a best-selling book) later, the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk, Pat Mitchell. Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea, and explores the ways that women still struggle with success.

Sheryl Sandberg 
Every social-justice movement has to uproot the power of internalised oppression and colonised minds. That’s especially hard for women because we live in the same house as the so-called superior group and don’t have a neighbourhood of our own, much less a country. With her new foundation and book, Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg is opposing both external and internal barriers to equality, which is one reason she’s misunderstood in an either/or world. Another is that she herself is successful. For a woman to be loved, she has to fail, and for a man to be loved, he has to succeed. That’s what the gender police say, and it’s inhuman and unfair to both men and women. Among her most radical suggestions is that if a woman wants children, her most important career decision is who her partner is, and if a man wants children, he could also raise them. This could begin to free us from gender police forever.



Date of birth
August 28th, 1969. Washington, D.C.
