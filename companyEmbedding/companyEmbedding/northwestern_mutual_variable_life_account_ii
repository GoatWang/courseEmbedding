What Is Variable Life Insurance?
Variable life insurance from Northwestern Mutual offers life insurance with the potential for greater cash value and death benefit growth than other types of permanent life insurance. Because you determine where your policy’s cash value is invested you can take on more risk in exchange for greater potential growth.
Here’s How Variable Life Insurance Works:
Variable life insurance is uniquely flexible. With it, you can:

Decide how you want the cash value that you build in your policy to be invested. You can choose from a variety of investment options across different asset classes, offering the potential for growth over time. These investment options may be subject to market fluctuations and may lose value.
Select and change your death benefit option and amount, based on your policy's provisions, to meet your changing needs.
Choose to make higher or lower premium payments within certain limits. Of course, your policy value will increase or decrease accordingly.
Utilize the cash value to meet financial goals.1
Transfer funds among your investment options, enabling you to adjust your strategy as your needs change during your life. Read the Prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.

Variable life Insurance may be a good choice if you understand the risks associated with investing, have a long-term time horizon and are willing to continue paying adequate premiums over time.

� Exhibit Q
 NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL VARIABLE LIFE ACCOUNT 
(Variable
CompLife�) 
Description of Issuance, Transfer and Redemption Procedures for Variable Life Insurance Contracts Pursuant to Rule 6e-2(b)(12)(ii).
 INTRODUCTION 
1. Rule 6e-2(b)(12) under the Investment Company Act provides exemption from Sections 22(d), 22(e) and 27(c)(1) of the Act and Rule 22c-1
thereunder for variable life insurance policies which meet the conditions of the Rule. (Rule 6e-2 has not been amended to reflect the addition of Section�27(i).) 
2. Rule 6c-3 provides exemptions for a registered variable life insurance separate account which registers under Section�8 of the
Act, except for exemption from the registration requirements, �under the same terms and conditions as a separate account claiming exemption under Rule 6e-2.� Therefore a separate account with registers as contemplated by Rule 6c-3 may be
required to include the materials referred to in Rule 6e-2(b)(12)(ii) as an exhibit to its registration statement filed under the Act. The purpose of this memorandum is to fulfill this requirement with respect to the variable life insurance policies
(�Policies�) previously offered in connection with Northwestern Mutual Variable Life Account (�Separate Account�), a separate investment account of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (�Northwestern Mutual�).
 3. Assets held in the Separate Account consist entirely of interest in shares of various series of the
Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., the Russell Investment Funds, and the Fidelity� VIP Mid Cap Portfolio
series of Fidelity Variable Insurance Products III, as well as any interest in shares of any other fund Northwestern Mutual may make available from time to time (collectively, the �Funds�). Shares of each series are valued daily as of the
close of trading on the NYSE.  �
-1- 


� The defined
terms used herein are the same as the defined terms in the Policy or prospectus, unless otherwise defined herein.  RULE
6e-2(b)(12)(ii)  4. Rule 6e-2(b)(12)(ii) provides exemptions from the sections and rule cited above to the extent
�necessary for compliance with .�.�. Rule 6e-2 or with insurance laws and regulations and established administrative procedures of the life insurer with respect to issuance, transfer and redemption procedures for variable life
insurance contracts funded by the separate account including, but not limited to, premium rate structure and premium processing, insurance underwriting standards, and the particular benefit afforded by the contract.�.�.�. The Rule
thus recognizes that the established procedures of the insurance company itself, founded on the requirements of state insurance law, have a principal role in defining the requirements which apply for variable life insurance offered by the same
company.  ISSUANCE PROCEDURES 
A. Premium Rate Structure and Insurance Underwriting Standards 
5. Premiums for the Policies, like premiums for Northwestern Mutual�s established series of conventional, fixed benefit life
insurance policies, will depend on the age, sex and insurance risk classification of the proposed insured, as well as the amount of insurance being purchased. Thus the price of the insurance will differ, reflecting established insurance procedures
and state law, in order to fairly take into account the differences in risks. The premiums for a Policy will be set forth in the Policy itself. Premiums for Policies at illustrative ages and amounts are included in the prospectus. The prospectus
illustrations, like those in the prospectuses for variable life insurance policies offered by Northwestern Mutual�s competitors, are based on premium rates for the best risk classification of nonsmokers, which Northwestern Mutual refers to as
Premier NT and Preferred NT.  �
-2- 


� 6. For the best
risk classification of nonsmokers (Premier NT and Preferred NT) and the best risk classifications of smokers (Premier T and Preferred T), premiums are based on the 1980 Commissioner�s Standard Ordinary Smoker and Nonsmoker Mortality Tables. For
other risk classifications, premiums are based on the 1980 Commissioner�s Standard Ordinary Mortality Table. The 1980 CSO Tables are used notwithstanding the reference to the 1958 Commissioner�s Standard Ordinary Mortality Table in the
definition of �sales load� in Rule 6e-2(c)(4). Use of 1980 CSO Tables is required by state law in Wisconsin, Northwestern Mutual�s domiciliary state, and in other states. The cost of insurance is lower under the 1980 CSO Tables
reflecting improvements in longevity since the 1958 CSO Table was developed. Use of the 1980 CSO Table is permitted for contracts filed under Rule 6e-3(T). 
7. As a mutual life insurance company organized in Wisconsin, Northwestern Mutual is also required to offer its insurance contracts as
participating policies which share equitably in Northwestern Mutual�s divisible surplus. The Policies accordingly have been designed on a participating basis and may pay dividends. Dividends provide the mechanism whereby the insurance
company�s policyholders share in the company�s experience. Since the pricing assumptions which underlie life insurance policies can be quite conservative, actual experience as it emerges is often more favorable than what was assumed. The
greater part of dividends paid under Northwestern Mutual�s fixed benefit policies arises from investment rates of return which are greater than the assumed rates of 2% to 5.5% on the policies presently outstanding. This investment aspect of
dividends does not relate to the Policies because the design of a variable life insurance policy provides a direct mechanism for reflection of investment results. The other factors for dividends, including the dividends for fixed benefit policies,
are the mortality and expense results. While these provide less than one-half of the dividend amounts for fixed benefit policies, they will be the entire source of the dividends paid on the Policies. 
�
-3- 


�
8. Notwithstanding the documented differences between male and female mortality rates, a 1983 decision of the U.S.
Supreme Court1 has created legal liability issues for
employers who purchase, or are otherwise involved in the purchases of, insurance products which are priced so as to reflect these differences. Similarly, the laws of individual states (currently only Montana) require that policies offered there use
a sex-neutral pricing basis. The Policies will accordingly be offered on a sex-neutral pricing basis for use as required in such situations. 
B. Procedures for Placing a Policy in Effect 
9. Northwestern Mutual no longer issues the Policy. 
C. Premium Processing for Existing Policies 
10. The Policies are structured as annual premium contracts, even though semiannual, quarterly and monthly premium frequencies will be
available. The net annual premium, after the deductions described in the prospectus, will be placed in the Separate Account on the Policy anniversary each year. The Policy anniversary will be the anniversary of the Policy Date. The amount of any
dividend will be paid annually as of the Policy anniversary, and placed in the Account on that date, unless the Policy Owner has elected to use the dividend other than to either increase Policy Value or purchase variable paid-up additional
insurance.  11. Because the net annual premium is placed in the Account on each Policy anniversary, regardless of the premium
frequency elected and regardless of the timeliness of premium payments, so long as the Policy does not lapse, the actual date on which a scheduled premium is received will not affect the Policy�s investment experience. Northwestern Mutual will
transfer the net annual premium amount from the General Account to the Separate Account on each Policy anniversary. Receipt of a scheduled premium by Northwestern Mutual represents a transaction between the Policy Owner and the General Account.

 Arizona Governing Committee, Etc. v. Norris, 103 S. Ct. 3492 (1983). 
�
-4- 


� 12. Unscheduled
additional premiums may be paid at any time prior to the Policy anniversary nearest to the insured�s 85th birthday, subject to our administrative practices, which may include evidence of insurability and MEC-limit review. Any unscheduled
premiums, less the deduction described in the prospectus, will be placed in the Separate Account as of the date received by Northwestern Mutual at the Home Office or a Network Office if received before the close of trading on the NYSE that day. If
received after the close of trading, premiums will be placed in the Separate Account on the next day.  13. Transactions
between the Separate Account and the General Account will be effected as of the dates determined in accordance with the terms of the Policy but the transactions will not in all cases be physically processed on those dates. For example, as described
below, the death of an insured will mark the date on which the Policy ceases to participate in the Separate Account, with interest being paid on Policy proceeds from that date until the Policy is settled, but several days may elapse before
Northwestern Mutual received notification. Because of the timing discrepancies the total assets of the Separate Account will not always exactly match the sum of the interests in the Separate Account represented by all of the Policies outstanding. An
accounting routine has been established to reconcile these amounts at least once each year, as of December�31, and the amount of assets in the Separate Account will be adjusted as required. 
14. Premiums paid more frequently than annually are increased to (1)�reflect the time value of money at 8% interest and
(2)�cover the administrative costs to process additional payments. In some instances, in order to ascertain Owner instructions, Northwestern Mutual may hold Premium amounts under established procedures if transaction instructions are not in
good order, which may include MEC review.  15. Northwestern Mutual will monitor Policies and will attempt to notify an Owner
on a timely basis if the Owner�s Policy is in jeopardy of becoming a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) under the Internal Revenue Code. Excess Premium may be refunded to the Owner, depending on the instructions received. If so instructed by the
Owner, Northwestern Mutual may hold Premium amounts for longer than established procedures. �Owner� may include an authorized representative of the Owner, if allowable under applicable law. If the Owner wants the excess payment applied and
the policy to become a MEC, the date they agree to making the policy a MEC is used as the effective date of the excess amount (the date Northwestern Mutual gets the instructions and the payment). The money up to the limit is applied as of the
original effective date, and the balance of the money is applied as of the receipt date of the instructions.  �
-5- 


� TRANSFER
PROCEDURES  A. Transfers 
16. The Separate Account currently consists of twenty-four Divisions, corresponding to twenty-four series of the Funds (each a
�Portfolio�, together the �Portfolios�). All assets of each Division are invested in shares of the corresponding Portfolio. The Policy Owner may direct that accumulated amounts under the Policy be transferred from one Division to
another, provided accumulated amounts remain in no more than ten Divisions at any one time. Where allowed by state law, the Policy reserves the right to charge an administrative fee for transfers. The amount of the fee will not exceed the
corresponding expenses. No fee is presently contemplated. Transfer requests must be in whole percentages and in amounts in greater than 1% of Invested Assets. When a transfer is made from any Division, the resulting allocation of Invested Assets
must be in whole percentages in all Divisions that have any Invested Assets as a result of the transfer. Transfers received by Northwestern Mutual at its Home Office before the close of trading on the NYSE will receive same-day pricing. Transfers
received by Northwestern Mutual at its Home Office after the close of trading will be priced on the next regular trading day. 
B. Short Term and Excessive Trading 
17. To deter short term and excessive trading, Northwestern Mutual has adopted and implemented policies and procedures which are designed
to control abusive trading practices and seeks to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all Policy Owners. Any exceptions must be either expressly permitted by these policies and procedures or subject to an approval process described in
them. Northwestern Mutual may also be prevented from uniformly applying these policies and procedures under applicable state or federal law or regulation.  �
-6- 


� Among the steps
Northwestern Mutual has taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions, including (with certain exceptions as identified in the prospectus) the prohibition of more than
twelve transfers (or multiple transfers on the same effective date) among Divisions under a single Policy during a Policy year. Further, an investor who is identified as having made a transfer in and out of the same Division (�round trip
transfer�) in an amount in excess of $10,000 within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until the next Policy Anniversary date, and sent a letter informing him or
her of the restriction. Thereafter, the same investor will be similarly restricted after the second such round trip transfer. An investor who is identified as having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days aggregating more
than one percent (1%)�of the total assets of the Portfolio underlying a Division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until the next Policy Anniversary
date after the second such round trip transfer. Thereafter, the same investor will be similarly restricted after the first such round trip transfer. These limitations do not apply to automatic asset transfers, scheduled or systematic transactions
involving portfolio rebalancing, dollar cost averaging, and interest sweeps, or to initial allocations, the use of asset allocation models or changes in future allocations. Once a Policy is restricted, Northwestern Mutual allows one additional
transfer into the Money Market Division until the next Policy Anniversary Date.  These policies and procedures may change from
time to time in Northwestern Mutual�s sole discretion without notice; provided, however, Policy Owners would be given advance, written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to accommodate market timing. Additionally, the Funds may
have their own policies and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to limit or restrict frequent trading. Such policies and procedures may provide for the imposition of a redemption fee and may require Northwestern Mutual to
provide transaction information to the Fund.  �

� Northwestern
Mutual intends to monitor events and the effectiveness of its policies and procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive trading practices are occurring. However, Northwestern Mutual may not be able to identify all
instances of abusive trading practices, nor completely eliminate the possibility of such activities, and there may be technological limitations on its ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of Policy Owners. 
REDEMPTION PROCEDURES 
A. Surrenders, Partial Surrenders and Withdrawals for Cash Value 
18. The Policy Owner may surrender the Policy for the cash value of the Policy at any time upon written request during the lifetime of
the insured. Northwestern Mutual will determine the cash value for a surrender request on the same day it receives the request if the request is received at the Home Office before the close of trading on the NYSE. Cash values for surrender requests
received by Northwestern Mutual at its Home Office after the close of trading will be determined on the next regular trading day. 
19. Northwestern Mutual will generally pay surrender proceeds within seven days of receipt of the Owner�s written request, except
under the circumstances described below in the �Deferral of Determination and Payment� section. At the election of the Owner and in lieu of direct payment, surrender proceeds may be paid under a payment plan. The Policies set forth the
terms and limitations for each plan, defines the persons who are entitled to make the selections and receive benefits, and refers to procedural rules. 
20. When a surrender of a Policy is effected, Northwestern Mutual will pay the cash value out of the assets held in the General Account.
An amount equal to the Invested Assets will be transferred from the Separate Account to the General Account as of the effective date of the surrender.  �
-8- 


� 21. By
administrative practice, Northwestern will permit the Policy Owner to surrender a part of the Policy. Calculations will be performed as if the Policy was split into two Policies, and one of them was surrendered. The Policy which continues in force
must meet the regular minimum size requirements and will pay premiums based on the reduced amount of insurance.  22. A
withdrawal of Policy Value may be made under certain conditions specified in the prospectus. The withdrawal may not be greater than the smaller of (1)�the Excess Amount less the surrender charge or (2)�an amount which would reduce the
maximum loan value to less than any outstanding Policy loan. The minimum amount for withdrawals is $250 and no more than four withdrawals may be made in a Policy year. The Policy reserves the right to charge an administrative fee of up to $25 per
withdrawal. No fee is presently charged.  23. Withdrawals will be made upon written request at the Northwestern Mutual�s
Home Office. The maximum allowable withdrawal will be determined by reference to computations as of the close of business on the day the request is received. The check for the amount withdrawn will be mailed from the Home Office. Withdrawals from
the Separate Account will generally be paid within seven days of receipt of the Owner�s written request, except under the circumstances described below in the �Deferral of Determination and Payment� section. 
B. Payment of Death Benefit 
24. Northwestern Mutual will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary or other payee in accordance with the terms of the Policy following
receipt at the Home Office of proof of the death of the insured. The amount of the Death Benefit paid will be determined as of the date of death. Northwestern Mutual may transfer Invested Assets into the money market division of the Separate Account
upon notification of death of the Insured until the Death Benefit is paid in order to minimize breakage. Payment of the death benefit is subject to the suicide and incontestability provisions of the Policy and any applicable state law requirements.
Payment will be made promptly and in any case within seven days after the last of the conditions is met, except under circumstances described below in the �Deferral of Determination and Payment� section. 
�
-9- 


� 25. The Death
Benefit for a Policy on any date when premiums have been timely paid will be equal to the sum of (1)�the minimum guaranteed death benefit of the Policy, (2)�any Additional Protection, (3)�any Excess Amount, (4)�any variable
benefit paid-up additions, and (5)�the amount of any dividend accumulations and any dividend at death, less the amount of any Policy loan outstanding. The Death Benefit is adjusted to reflect any premium due if the insured dies during the grace
period. The Death Benefit will not be less than the amount of insurance calculated by applying the Policy Value as a net single premium at the insured�s attained age plus any variable paid-up additional insurance and any dividend accumulations
and dividend at death, less the amount of any Policy loan outstanding.  26. Northwestern Mutual will pay the Death Benefit for
a Policy out of assets held in the General Account. Unless the Death Benefit is paid in a lump sum, it will be paid under a payment plan selected by the Owner or the beneficiary. If the Death Benefit is paid in a lump sum and the amount meets our
criteria, Northwestern Mutual will pay the Death Benefit by establishing an interest-bearing account. Account information, along with a book of drafts that function like a checkbook, will be provided. When a draft is paid through the bank that
administers the account, the bank will receive the amount requested from the General Account. The amount payable will include interest from the date of death. An amount equal to the interest of the Policy in the Separate Account as of the date of
death will be transferred from the Separate Account to the General Account.  �
-10- 


� C. Lapse and
Reinstatement  27. The Policy provides a grace period of 31
days2 for payment of any premium not paid when due. If the
premium is paid during the grace period, the policy values will not be affected by the delay in paying the premium. If the insured dies during the grace period, the death proceeds will be reduced by the amount of the unpaid premium as described in
the description of the death benefit above.  28. If a periodic premium is not paid within the grace period, the policy will
lapse unless the Owner has the automatic premium loan provision in effect and there is sufficient value to pay the premium due where the premium is less than the maximum amount allowable. Northwestern Mutual will process premiums on the same day it
receives the payment if the payment is received at the Home Office before the close of trading on the NYSE. Payments received by Northwestern Mutual at its Home Office after the close of trading will be determined on the next regular trading day. If
the cash value on the last day of the grace period is at least $1,000, the lapsed policy will continue in force as fixed benefit paid-up insurance. The amount of paid-up insurance will be determined by applying the amount of cash value, determined
as of the last day of the grace period, as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured. If the cash value is less than $1,000 on the last day of the grace period, the Policy will be treated as surrendered. 
29. In lieu of fixed benefit paid-up insurance the Owner of a lapsed Policy may elect a variable benefit paid-up insurance if the Policy
has a cash value of at least $5,000 on the last day of the grace period. As of the due date of the unpaid premium, the Policy Value is set equal to the cash value (including the value of any existing paid-up additions) plus the amount of any Policy
loan outstanding. Any existing variable paid-up additional insurance is set at zero. The Policy loan then remains outstanding. The amount of variable paid-up additional insurance, at any time, is determined by applying its cash value plus the amount
of any Policy loan as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured. If the paid-up provision goes into effect before the Owner has paid the premium due at the beginning of the fifteenth year, Northwestern Mutual will deduct the
appropriate surrender charge.  �
2
 In administering the Policies Northwestern Mutual intends to use a 66-day period, instead of 31 days, before the lapse routine is implemented. The longer period is used simply to reduce the
volume of lapse and reinstatement transactions occasioned by miscalculation when Owners attempt to pay the overdue premium on the last day of the grace period. The 66-day period is used for Northwestern Mutual�s fixed benefit insurance policies
and will be administered consistently. It does not appear in the prospectus for the Policies because its purpose would be defeated if Policy Owners know that the extra time would be allowed. When the 66 days have transpired and the Policy lapses,
the values will be computed as though the Policy had lapsed after the grace period of 31 days. Notwithstanding the postponement of internal procedures to reflect the fact of a lapse, the Policy does lapse upon the expiration of the grace period and
the death benefit is determined accordingly if the insured dies thereafter regardless of whether the internal procedures have been implemented prior to the date of death.  �

-11- 


� 30. When a
Policy lapses and fixed benefit paid-up insurance goes into effect, the Policy ceases to have any interest in the Separate Account. An amount equal to the interest of the Policy in the Separate Account, determined as of the last day of the grace
period, will be transferred from the Separate Account to the General Account as of the due date of the unpaid premium.  31. A
lapsed Policy may be reinstated while the insured is alive within three years (longer if required by state law) after the premium due date. Reinstatement is conditional upon evidence of insurability and payment of the greater of (1)�all unpaid
minimum premiums plus interest at 5%, or (2)�110% of the increase in cash value which results from reinstatement plus unpaid premiums, with interest at 5%, for any optional riders attached to the Policy. Reinstatement will be effected as of the
date when the request is received or any future date requested, and investment experience in the Separate Account will continue from that date. Northwestern Mutual will calculate the cash amount required upon request. Upon reinstatement, the Policy
Date will not change. In addition reinstatement, the Policy will have the cash value, death benefit and loan value which it would have had if the Policy had not lapsed and if a 4% rate of investment earnings were credited for the period from the due
date of the overdue premium to the date of reinstatement. The cash amount required to reinstate a Policy will be paid into the General Account and the amount required for the Separate Account reserve will be placed in the Separate Account as of the
reinstatement date. Any Policy loan outstanding, with interest thereon, must be either repaid or reinstated.  D.
Reinvestment after Surrender or Withdrawal  32. While Owners have no right to reinvestment after a surrender or
withdrawal, Northwestern Mutual may permit such reinvestments in its sole discretion as described in prospectus. Owners may make payments in the form of returned surrender or withdrawal proceeds in connection with a request to void a surrender or
withdrawal if the request is received by Northwestern Mutual within a reasonable time after the surrender or withdrawal proceeds are mailed. The returned surrender or withdrawal proceeds will be reinvested at the unit value next determined for each
Division after our receipt of the reinvestment request in good order at the Home Office, including, among other things, (1)�the return of surrender or withdrawal proceeds, (2)�satisfactory evidence of insurability and any (3)�Premium
Payments due. Proceeds will be applied to the same Divisions from which the surrender or withdrawal was made. Depending on the underwriting classification of the Insured, Northwestern Mutual may not accept the reinvestment or may accept the
reinvestment with different charges and expenses under the Policy. Northwestern Mutual may refuse to process reinvestments where it is not administratively feasible. 
�
-12- 


� E. Right to
Exchange for a Fixed-Benefit Policy  33. Owners may exchange their Policies for a life insurance policy that does not vary
with the investment experience of the Separate Account for any reason for two years after the Date of Issue according to our procedures or as required by state law. Owners may also exchange for a fixed-benefit Policy at any time under certain
circumstances if a Fund changes its investment adviser or makes a material change to the investment policies of a Portfolio. 
F. Policy Loans and Loan Repayments 
34. The Policies provide that the Owner may borrow from Northwestern Mutual using the Policy as collateral security. The maximum loan
value is 90% of the cash value of the Policy. If a Policy loan is already outstanding, these limitations are applied to the amount of cash value which the Policy would have if there were no loan. 
35. The Policy provides that loans will be made upon written request, or, in certain circumstances, by telephone. If Northwestern Mutual
receives a request for a loan at the Home Office on or before the close of trading on the NYSE, the loan will be effective as of the close of trading that day. If the request is received after the close of trading, the loan will be effective on the
next day. The date of the loan will be the date on which the check for the loan proceeds is issued. The maximum loan value of the Policy will be determined by reference to computations at the close of business the preceding day after the request for
the loan was submitted but before processing took place and interest will accrue on the loan from the date of the check. When a written loan request is completed by the Policy owner, the Policy owner can elect to have the proceeds sent via check,
direct deposit to a specified bank account, or wire transfer. We presently charge a $25 fee for wire transfer requests.  �
-13- 


� 36. The Policy
Owner may elect an automatic premium loan feature whereby the loan value of the Policy will be available to pay any overdue premium. The feature may be elected or revoked at any time by written request. 
37. Interest on a Policy loan accrues and is payable on a daily basis. Unpaid interest is added to the principal. The Policy will
terminate if the cash value of the Policy falls to zero, but written notice will be mailed to the owner of the Policy at least 31 days before the termination date. The notice will state the amount which must be repaid to keep the Policy in force.
 38. The Policy Owner may choose between two Policy loan interest rates. One is a fixed rate of 5% and the other is a variable
rate based on a corporate bond index with an annual adjustment and minimum of 5%. The choice of rates is made on the application form and may be changed as of January�1 any year upon written request. 
39. When a Policy loan is affected, the loan amount is taken from the Divisions of the Separate Account in proportion to the amounts in
the Divisions. The amounts withdrawn from the Separate Account are credited with an earnings rate equal to the Policy loan interest rate in effect less an amount for expenses, including taxes. The amount deducted for expenses is disclosed in the
prospectus. This earnings rate is in lieu of the investment experience of the Separate Account.  �
-14- 


� 40. Loan
repayments (and accrued interest) may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time while the Insured is alive. If payment is received without specific instructions, it is applied to any premium due, with any remaining amount being applied to any
outstanding loans. Payments in excess of outstanding debt and premiums due will be returned. Except as described below, if payments are received before the close of trading on the NYSE, Northwestern Mutual will credit payments as of the date
received and transfer them from the General Account to the Divisions, in proportion to the amounts in the Divisions as of the same date. If payments are received on or after the close of trading on the NYSE, Northwestern Mutual will credit payments
as of the close of the next regular trading session of the NYSE and transfer them from the General Account to the Divisions, in proportion to the amounts in the Divisions, as of the date Northwestern Mutual credits the payment.�Policy
loan payments received within 34 days after the loan interest billing date will be credited as of the loan interest billing date. Automatic premium loan payments received up to 66 days after the loan interest billing date will be credited as of the
Policy Anniversary, depending on an Owner�s premium payment schedule.  G. Deferral of Determination and Payment
 41. Northwestern Mutual will ordinarily pay Policy benefits within seven days after all required documents are received at
its Home Office. However, we may defer determination and payment of benefits if:  �


�
�
�
 the NYSE is closed, other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE is restricted as determined by the SEC; or
 �


�
�
�
 the SEC permits, by an order, the postponement of any payment for the protection of Owners; or 
�


�
�
�
 the SEC determines that an emergency exists that would make the disposal of securities held in the Separate Account or the determination of their value
not reasonably practicable.  42. When the Policy is in force as Fixed Paid-Up insurance, Northwestern Mutual
may defer paying the Cash Value for up to six months from the date of surrender. If payment is deferred for 30 days or more, interest will be paid on the Cash Value at an annual effective rate of 4%. Northwestern Mutual may also defer payment of a
Policy loan or withdrawal for up to six months.  �
-15- 


� 43. If an Owner
submits a check or draft to our Home Office, Northwestern Mutual has the right to defer payment of the Death Benefit, surrender, withdrawals, loans, or payment plan proceeds until the check or draft has been honored. 
44. To the extent it is disclosed in the prospectus, Northwestern Mutual may defer payment of the Death Benefit if it legitimately needs
time to determine the proper beneficiaries.  45. If mandated under applicable law, Northwestern Mutual may be required to
freeze an Owner�s Policy Value and thereby refuse to pay any requests for transfer, surrender, withdrawals, loans, or the Death Benefit, until instructions are received from the appropriate regulatory or other lawful authority. Northwestern
Mutual may also be required to provide additional information about an Owner, the Owner�s Policy, and the Owner�s trading activities to government regulators.  �

										Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is one of the biggest scammers out there today. I was a student attending the University of Dubuque, when I started looking for an internship. Northwestern Mutual was supposedly a "highly rated" company that had a "highly rated" internship program. My interview consisted of interigating me on every person I knew and they basically wanted me to come in and set up appointments with my friends and family so they could harrass them to buy more insurance. I then did further research after my interview, and talked to a couple classmates who had participated in their internship program  (by the way, was amazing how many people this company interviewed with. EVERYBODY!) Every, and I mean every, person I talked to said their "trainer" went in and pushed their friends and family and did hard sales with their horrible insurance programs. I was even more shocked when I found out their savings programs inside their insurance policies were even a bigger scam then their so called internship program. Did you know that when their clients die, Northwestern Mutual KEEPS THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT! Tell me how a savings account at all benefits a client that when they die, their family loses it! RIP OFF! RIP OFF! RIP OFF! They had no interest in training me and simply wanted to use my name when they called individuals that I knew to sell them garbage at that. I advise you, stay as far away from this company as you can.									    This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 10/12/2009 09:33 AM and is a permanent record located here:

										 0Author 16Consumer 0Employee/Owner    Updates & Rebuttals     #1 Consumer Comment  Northwest Mutual Paid Out AUTHOR: Micki -  (USA) SUBMITTED: Friday, April 14, 2017 POSTED: Friday, April 14, 2017   When my husband was diagnosed with cancer and we knew he was terminal, one of the things on his bucket list was to take the grandkids to Disney World.  We had not met them before and this would have been the first time we saw them because my son had moved to Colorado from Florida.  We didn't have the funds for this type of trip, so I cashed in my life insurance policy for what it was worth: $10,000. They did not ask me a thousand questions, the rep said it was my money to with what I wanted.  We got my son's family to Disney and were on our way from Key West to Orlando to meet them and have a great vacation/family reunion.  My husband didn't make it.  Half way up, he went into crisis and was gone 8 days later.  My husband passed away from kidney cancer caused by cigarette smoking.  I was bedside when he passed and was a complete absolute mess.  When I called NWM to report his passing, the live person I spoke with, not a computer, was nothing but compassionate, patient and knowledgable.  They took their time with me and helped me file the final claim.  I continue to have a ploicy for my mother, and I took out a new policy on myself. I know when the time comes, this company will not play games with our benificiaries.      Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #2 UPDATE EX-employee responds  Just To set some Myths aside AUTHOR: JustTryingToHelp -  () SUBMITTED: Thursday, July 24, 2014 POSTED: Thursday, July 24, 2014    I had to jump in because of so many misinterprutations.  I have worked in financial for years, and years, and years.  Interned with NWM and they do a great job of informing their employees on all the benefits of using their products and how great they are.  The problem is they never talk about the other options that are out there and what is best for the client.  Right away they teach you that a whole life policy is the best thing ever and that they have the best one.  Half true.  I think they do have one of the best out there but they only make sense for a small chunk of people.  Problem is they recommend it to everyone!  The interest is not fixed and is based off of the performance of the company.  In that aspect all your doing in a while life policy is buying NWM stock and collecting the everchanging dividend without growth of the asset itself.  Then you take insurance fees out, which they will never discuss but are necessary.  So at the end of the day take out maybe .5% if your young and 2% if your old from your cash value every year so your really earning some fraction of that dividend.  Now take your "Loan" out from the cash and pay an interest rate on the loan taken from the remaining cash value.  Again depleting your savings.

It was great. AUTHOR: Tim S -  () SUBMITTED: Saturday, January 25, 2014 POSTED: Saturday, January 25, 2014   I read this report simply because in the late 80's I was in NML's college agent program. The ignorance of this claim against NML was so vast as to be exhausting. It is a Saturday night and I would much rather be relaxing. Instead, there is this monumentally sad attempt to harm a good company. Doing a little reading between the lines here, I can make a few guesses. One, I doubt you listened to the training. If you did, you did not understand it nor care for the discipline involved in being a saver or an agent. Two, you probably found it difficult to make money. Even if the commissions are what they were then you probably did not make money. The tone of the complaint makes it hard for me to imagine that you had the ear of too many people on matters as important as how to save money long term, provide needed death benefits, or even why savings and investments are completely different animals. I have not worked for Northwestern Mutual for decades but the business lessons and experiences I gained as an intern are invaluable to me even today at this late date. I know of five companies I would trust to put my permanent life insurance needs and Northwestern Mutual and its practices are designed to protect policy holders within the paramenters of providing maximum benefits with maximum dividend performance. That is a complex set of responsibilities. Northwest Mutual has my continued respect as do their training programs that I went through. Tim S.    Respond to this report!  What's this?

One $120K "investment" at NWM turned out to be a money-market account that was "earning" minus-$500 per year, after all of the fees were deducted.  When I challenged the wisdom of this account, I was told that, as retirees, we needed to have conservative investments, especially in trying financial times.  After insisting that the money-market account be closed, we were told that NWM would, out of the goodness of their heart, make a one-time exception to their rules and, at my request, reinvest the funds in a more risky account (something our NWM advisor told us was almost unheard of).  Since the money was going from one NWM account into another, I assumed the change would be free or that any charges would be nominal.  Our next statement, however, showed a "withdrawal charge" of more than $5000.  We were neither informed orally nor in writing that such a charge would occur.  I'm sure a withdrawal charge is stated somewhere in the mountains of fine print we received from the company, but I haven't found it yet.  My wife and I don't claim to be well prepared to understand the complexities of modern financial products.  However, we do expect that our money will be skillfully invested by the professionals of a major financial institution.  Northwest Mutual claims to be a Financial Services and Wealth Management company (it's on their letterhead).  I assumed we could trust them to look out for our interests while making a fair return on the money they invest.  But this example (and others that are too complex to explain here) suggest otherwise.  If you're in the same boat, be sure you ask lots of questions and read everything before signing on the dotted line.  I'm very serious about that--don't sign anything until you fully understand it and have asked lots of questions.  If you don't understand it, then you should find another company to handle your money.

There are many empassioned responses defending the honesty and sanctity of whole term life policies, and how great Northwest Mutual is, well to this, I say rubbish. Here is why. In some aspects, whole term life insurance may be a reasonable investment, IF you truly understand what you are getting into, and realized when your net cash value will break even, etc. However, certain representatives, eg christopher hahn( a bloated clown who was voted best financial rep for 2007, such jilted self serving awards, made by vultures for vultures) for instance, prey upon the financially ignorant , and use very aggressive , even bullshit scare tactics to get their victim to sign up. So in essence they are financial predators, case closed. Believe me , this is only my experience some 10 yrs ago, and actually, when I woke up, was lucky enough to cancel the policy at not such a significant loss. I could go on and on about unscrupulous procedural techniques, eg: isolating the victim, not talking to anyone else but you , so as to avoid more experienced questions, saying that a decision had to be made within 1 day as this was a "special offer", etc, etc....But ultimately, I would just tell the newbies out there (eg, just out of academia, greener than green), when it comes to whole life: be aware how much they are asking you to invest, really look at the ridiculous premiums paid out, compared to term insurance, realize opportunity cost of this vs immediate tax advantages of a 401k, and lastly realize how long they will have you put money into a hole, hoping some day it will pay out, with actually, only guaranteeing not even a 4% return , if that , perhaps just your principal, minus fees. Essentially be prepared that this is a long term investment, eg, dont expect to even break even until 12 years or more. If you do the math for a 25yr + policy, you will be horrified at the money you put into it, vs what you get out. Lastly, while again, in less aggressive ways, this could make sense in terms of a small policy, however, I KNOW FOR A FACT that these s**t suckers, aggressively target individuals who are just out of shool, or new to the area, with little or no experience. Lastly however, it is upto you to be strong, because ultimately, there is nobody to truly blame but yourself for being talked into something without complete understanding. 10+ years later, I am so much better off for it, that in certain regards, I should thank assholes like this for burning me, because my knowledge, savy and wisdom took off exponentially, and now I can retire if I wanted to. Burn me once, great, it is how you dust yourself off and learn from mistakes, and become all the better. Good luck people,  nobody and everybody who just tries to make their way    Respond to this report!  What's this?

														I have about 6 years of experience in the insurance/securities industry, and I truly feel sorry for anyone who does business with Northwest Mutual. Their products are horribly priced and generally outdated (6% dividends sounds great until you realize you're paying literally 2-3x as much in premium as you would be in a modern IUL), plus their sales force are a bunch of sharks and I've had multiple clients tell me about being offered rebates from NW agents if they sign up (meaning the agents offered to pay the premiums of the policy for 1-3 months, which is unethical and illegal). 
Their financial ratings are sound, largely because they are robbing you on the premiums they charge. Inevitably, this will provoke NW agents to start posting responses about the dividend payouts, but the bottom line is when you do the math, their whole life policies are SCREWING YOU. You can get the same tax-deferred growth and even more competitive returns through AXA Equitable's VUL or National Life group or North American's IUL products for 60-75% of the premium contribution. Plus all of the above named companies offer Long Term Care provisions that allow clients to access death benefits in a life policy for LTC purposes. 
Trust me, if a NW Mutual agent offers to "buy you lunch so he can introduce you to what he does," politely decline. Their products are a joke and they love to dangle the dividends in front of you but they're only telling a very small part of the whole story, which is that they'll rob you in the process and sell you an outdated product (Northwest mutual whole life is like buying a Nokia brick cell phone in 2013.)

														Savings accounts?  Are you talking about whole life insurance cash value?  Normally there's a selection in the application process whereby the client can select whether or not he/she wants the death benefit plus the cash value for an extra cost in premium.  The insurance company figures that you want the greater of the death benefit or the cash value.  The death benefit is usually greater.  Instead of paying the insurance company, why not buy term and some perm for the insurance need.  Term, remember, pays a claim only 3% of all policies in force.  Therefore, the perm is useful to pay expenses, as it's permanent and will be there when your client dies. 													   Respond to this report!

														I'm an advertising sales professional & truly appreciate everything that Northwestern Mutual has done for me with respect to planning my retirement. It's been incredibly difficult to weed through all of the options that are out there when it comes to retirement. My Northwestern rep started out in the same internship program you've mentioned in your report, but had a very different experience. I'm not sure what sort of a career you plan to go into, but if you intend to go into any type of selling job, you'll need to know how to work your friends & family to your advantage. I feel that my whole life policy from Northwestern is a great "fallback investment", in addition to my 401k, Roth IRA (Which I can no longer contribute to), Social Security, and cash savings. I understand that without an extensive knowledge of finances, it would be difficult for an intern to see the value of a long-term, guaranteed investment such as a whole life insurance policy. There are several advantages to it. 1) A whole life policy grows at a guaranteed 6% interest rate. Over the term of my policy, I will pay in roughly $48,000. However, at my paid-up date, it will be worth $100k 2) I can withdraw against a whole life policy when I'm older, without paying income tax. That makes it better than a savings account, and, generally speaking, better than a 401k (tax-free when you contribute, but taxed at normal rates upon withdrawal), but slightly worse than a Roth IRA, which is taxed pre-contribution, but tax-free at withdrawal. The downside to a Roth IRA is that you can only contribute up to $5k annually, until you earn a salary of 107k or greater. Once you earn that large of a salary, your contributions are limited even further, and ultimately eliminated at an income of $122k, leaving your only true, tax-free (at distribution) retirement option to be a whole life insurance policy. Is your post suggesting that Northwestern doesn't deserve to earn a profit for helping millions of American's retire comfortably? They're currently one of the highest rated financial services firms in the country, and they do it all without public relations & branding advertising (You've surely heard of companies like Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Scottrade, etrade, ING Direct, etc).  The bottom line is this: You should really be investing in nearly every type of retirement investment you possibly can. You'll almost always be better off. Just imagine if the millions of folks who were deeply invested in their company's 401k had been a bit more diversified in 2008 when their retirement plans lost 30% of their value in the stock market crash! If they had even 25-30% of their investments secured in whole life insurance policies, they wouldn't have been hurt nearly as badly. A small (very small) portion of the job crunch has also been caused by the lack of retirement that's happening in the workplace as a result of these losses. See this report, from before the recession hit, which shows that fewer than half of all Americans expect to be able to retire comfortably - this was 6 months before the market crashed: (((ROR REDACTED))) and this from more recently (November 2010) which points out that Employers will have a tough time facilitating the promotion of younger employees who want to get ahead: http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2010/11/02/fewer-americans-planning-to-retire/ 
No, I do not work for Northwestern Mutual, nor do I work in the insurance industry, or financial services industry. But I will retire very comfortably, while you (the author of this "ripoff" report), will most likely be working until you die.

														I have owned four Northwestern Mutual life insurance policies for many years and my experience with the company has been entirely positive. When I bought these insurance policies I did extensive research and ran the numbers. This company, along with New York Life and Mass Mutual, came out on top. They pay great dividends and have been doing so for a very long time. They've been in business for over 150 years. They will be paying out $4.9 billion in dividends next year, the second highest amount in company history and more than the next two highest paying companies combined. They are one of only a handful companies with a A++ rating from A.M. Best. Does that sound like a "rip off" company selling a "garbage product"? I have had dealings with two of their reps and they have never pushed me to buy anything or given me a "hard sell." The original report's comments about the "savings program" being a "scam" are simply ridiculous and show a basic lack of understanding about how life insurance works.

														I have been in the insurance business for over 22 years. From running my own company and to selling to a larger corporation. Been on the independent side, general agent side and now part of NML. The first statement is this company in every regards puts the client first. You will find out they have their policy holders every year do their own audit of the company and their practices. Name another company allowing this today. To my knowledge their is no top 1000 company doing it. Next take their conservative stance to underwriting and you will see in their large dividend pay outs to policy holders a large portion comes from great underwriting. Now as a representative this can be frustrating when you have a president or key employee you want to insure and the company will not insure them due to medical issues. But it is in the policy holders best interest to only take risk in their best interest.  The policy holder/owners of the company do come first. Yes owners, a mutual company is owned by the policy holders. They do not have to show the big profits to share holders but only to the owners/policy holders. The company will also not tolerate representatives that due not follow their strict guide lines of professional representation. I have seen them fire a large producer for not following the rules as defined by them. Their are no exceptions to these rules. In other companies I have seen the old saying of production hides the sins. Not here if you do not keep records of your sales in a compliant manner and do what is best for the client, you will be looking for a job.    As a old time representative it was hard for me to do all their required education and record keeping but now after a short time it has paid off. If a client questions something I can go into our system and show them my dictations of the meeting and most of the time back it up with letters or emails explaining what we did an why. So you can teach an old dog new trick.     Our system is set up like a doctors would operate. When we see a client we find their needs and desires for their future and their families goals & dreams. We explore the what if's that are so hard for most people to talk about unless someone like myself comes to them as an advocate for their kids or spouse. In a role as the advocate we are the voice for the ones with out one. We are the ones that help a person provide for their family for the unexpected things in life. No one expects to die early or become disabled. When it does happen, they are always blessed when they did the responsible thing and took care of their family for those issues. Yes I said responsible, because it is our job to provide for our family in those times of need. When we have a child and do not take out disability or life insurance on our life it is a disservice as a parent. Almost child abuse at times. Would you want your child in foster care because you did not have life insurance when you and your spouse died before your time. I know with my family and friends it would be hard to see their family suffer because I did not do my job and ask the hard questions. You insure your house? So why would you not insure your families most important asset. YOU    In closing I will say that if you do not care for your family and friends then stay the path of not doing the responsible thing and sharing the need of life insurance and disability insurance with them. This is a selfless act to provide for your families needs at a premature death or disability. In looking at companies you will not find a better company, financially or ethically. This is coming from a guy that has been around for many years in this business. Also from my personal life and seeing it pay off when a family member died a early death. The money was their for the funeral and other cost needed, It was there because I asked the hard question and showed the need and provided the solution. These risk based products are a need for almost every individual but like other things in this country today we do not always do the responsible things. To many people live for today and let others worry when their dead. I have never had a widow say would you give me my savings part of the death benefits and you can keep the balance. Some people may pay a few hundred dollars in the so called savings part of their life insurance contract but receive millions back in the death benefit portion. In some cases the savings part is completed with the disability waiver added to the policy. So my question to you is, are you going to be responsible and take care of your family and purchase the needed death and disability benefits? Or will you allow the state or government to provide for your family if you die or become a disabled. If something happens to my family and friends I do not want to tell their children I did not do my job. No I want to be able to say your parents loved you enough to do the right thing an protect you even if they were not here to do so them selves.    If you need information on companies strength review the rating agencies of insurance companies. If you need to make the correct financial decisions find a reputable insurance professional. You can do back ground checks with most department of insurances and FINRA for securities checks. Do your home work and work with a professional. You can always find the closest NML office and talk to them. Thanks for this chance to tell another side of the story.

														First and foremost, Northwestern Mutual does interview a lot of candidates, especially for their internship program.  I was part of that process when I started as an intern in January 2009.  Let's look at this point first.  Northwestern has the reputation as the "Quiet Company," meaning that they don't spend a lot of their money on advertising in mass media.  While this is changing now, it is a great point for policy holders because the company is not spending its reserve funds on needless advertising.  With that point in mind, how many college students do you think have heard of Northwestern Mutual by actively seeking out insurance and investment advice or by seeing their commercials on t.v.?  I'll go out on a limb and say not a whole lot. So, for Northwestern to bring new blood into the company, they have to actively recruit competent talent.  Where to find these individuals with work ethic, smarts, and a drive to succeed? That's right, on college campuses.  So yes, they have to go out, see people, and find those with a passion to serve others.Number two, the "hard sale" of insurance products.  The company culture of Northwestern is not to "sell" anyone.  It is to identify a need and make recommendations for that need.  During the process of helping individuals build financial security, there are many aspects a financial representative needs to cover.  These areas include: saving, investing, debt reduction, and protecting a family with insurance products.  Out of these areas, which do you think a college student could be competent enough to explain, investment products or insurance coverage?  In my opinion it is far easier to learn the basics of insurance than investment strategies, risks, and returns for savvy investors.  Not to mention that it would take much to long, and no student would even try, to obtain securities licenses for an internship.  So, we are left with interns getting a license for life insurance which is still part of a comprehensive financial plan and much easier to put into place than investments.The third point of Northwestern keeping the cash value of a policy holder that dies is easy to rebut.  Yes, they keep the cash value.  That's right, I said that they do indeed keep the cash value.  But, that's because the surviving family receives the death benefit.  So, now it's time for an example.  Say John bought a $100,000 whole life (permanent) insurance policy 30 years ago.  Hypothetically the cash in the policy is $20,000 and the face value (death benefit) has gone up to $200,000. (Anyone with working knowledge of permanent insurance knows that cash value increases as well as the death benefit, barring any tweeks made by the policy owner that would keep these at a level amount).  John has lived a long life and passes, leaving the $200,000 death benefit to his family.  Northwestern keeps the $20,000 in cash value and premiums paid in.  If you could explain how getting 200k is better than getting the cash of 20k is better please go ahead.  Now, some would say, "Why don't they get both?"  I would say to that, how in the world would a company stay in business if it paid the death claim and all cash in the policy.  There would be no way to sustain the company if the only payment they ever got was premium.  Last, no one who uses the policy exclusively for the death benefit is concerned with the 'savings' aspect.  Younger people will like the savings aspect and can use the cash throughout their lifetime and should do so based on their specific goals.  If the 'savings' is a RIP OFF, please show me another asset that draws a 6.15% return (current Northwestern dividend), on a tax deferred basis, with no early withdrawal penalty.  IT CAN'T BE FOUND.  But to get interesting let's try.  Savings account - hahahaha, if you're lucky a 1% return - congratulations you lost out to inflation.  CD's - again 1-1.5% return, TAXED - still losing to inflation.  Bond portfolio - In this day in age still at 5-7% with junk bonds, taxed so that the real return is below 5%, and if it is inside IRAs there are early withdrawal penalties.  IRAs and 401k - great place for LONG TERM saving - they will get you the best returns with the right asset allocation, but if you want that money before you are 60 you will pay taxes and penalties.  So, you tell me what asset gives you great return, defers taxes (and has many options to use the money tax free), and is accessible to you at any time? You got it...Life Insurance through Northwestern Mutual.Now as far as them contacting family and friends, who else would you know to contact and have such an important conversation with?  Yes, that's right, you would have rather called on executives, partners in law firms, engineers, etc. because they would have certainly taken a college student seriously.  You have to start in your natural market, let them see the value you bring, and then be referred out to other individuals.  There shouldn't be a problem talking with your family and in fact those should be the most important conversations you have.  Consider your family not having the right amount of life coverage, or none at all.  Most likely a premature death would devastate the family; be it a parent, child, or primary wage earner.  I can say from experience that 80-90% of the people I have talked with don't have adequate coverage based on what they would want to have covered if they passed prematurely.  If you didn't talk with them about life insurance, no one probably ever would; which would be a sad tragedy.  Talk with a few financial reps, financial advisors, or even friends and family members and see if you can't come up with some stories of families or individuals devastated by a lack of life coverage.  It is just as important, if not more, than the investing part.  If you can come up with someone who has never heard of or known a person affected by losing a loved one too soon then you can bash life insurance all you like.  But I will venture that you can't find someone like that.In closing, life insurance is vital, no matter who you get it through.  But, if you are going to purchase something so important, why not go through the best company?  By best I am pointing to Northwestern Mutual, who has the strongest financial ratings across the board with a positive future outlook.  They are in fact the only insurance company with those ratings and one of only a handful of any type of company in the world with those ratings.  So it makes sense why they are so beloved even when there is misunderstood slander put out by people on sites like these.  For those that would like to rebut the ratings, feel free to look at the four large ratings firms and see where Northwestern ranks.  New York Life will claim the strongest ratings also, but they have a negative outlook, which indicates they will soon be downgraded; leaving Northwestern alone at the top.
