Interview with Roy Terracina, the CEO of Sunshine Ventures, Inc.


Leave a comment
					Posted by royterracina on October 16, 2011



Roy Terracina, the CEO of Sunshine Ventures, Inc., in San Antonio, Texas, talks about his motivations and the secrets of his success. Mr. Terracina earned his MBA from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and has served on the boards of organizations such as U.S. Global Investors, Inc.; Milestone Partners; and Our Lady of the Lake University.
 
1. You have had your hand in a number of business ventures throughout the years. Was this part of a long-term strategy to diversify your investments?
Would that it were, but no, I wouldn’t say so. Throughout my career I just followed my passion and the things that meant the most to me. This led me on a journey through several different industries and, while not part of a grand plan, the knowledge I gained proved, and continues to prove, beneficial. Having hands-on experience in the operation of several types of businesses certainly comes in handy when considering potential investments.
 
2. What is your secret weapon in terms of business?
As I mentioned, following my passion is imperative, not only in business, but in all aspects of my life. Balancing what’s important in your business life with what’s important in your personal life creates a kind of synergy that keeps you focused and energetic. If you can find and follow these paths without letting either drain from the other, you end up with more than the sum of the parts. You only have one life, so creating a strategy that leaves you feeling energized about work, about your family, and about your interests strikes me as being of fundamental importance.
 
3. You serve on the boards of a number of charity organizations such as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Where do these charities fit into the equation?
Well, they fit in, essentially with the fact that the line between my business and personal life sort of blurs. I have a deep desire to help others as best I can, and I am fortunate enough to have the resources to do it. It is not a business impulse that has me seated on those boards, but I am proud to bring my business skills to the table in order to help those organizations succeed.

Keys to Effective Business Leadership with Roy Terracina


Leave a comment
					Posted by royterracina on August 9, 2011



There are dozens of clichéd phrases and worn-out mottos for how to manage people effectively, but they provide little substance or practical advice for how to improve as a leader. While some people possess an innate knack for leadership, others are able to learn many of the qualities needed to succeed in a position of power. Here are some of the keys to becoming an effective business leader:
 
Have a Vision: Nobody can follow a leader unless the leader knows the way. Make short-, mid-, and long-term planning part of your corporate philosophy and be sure to include tangible steps to take in order to achieve your goals. Once the plan is in place, it is the leader’s responsibility to get all of the employees on the same page and working toward that common purpose.
 
Encourage Creativity: Never underestimate the value of innovation in a global economy. It pays to encourage employees to develop new ideas and think outside the box. Many top companies, such as Google, even allot time for employees to innovate and work on new projects. In the case of Google, this dedication to creativity has resulted in several successful products, including Gmail, Google News, and the lucrative AdSense business.
 
Know Your Role: Being a good leader means striking a balance between being an overbearing dictator and a spineless pushover. As someone to whom everyone in the company will naturally look for guidance, the leader needs a commanding knowledge of the business and the industry in order to answer questions quickly and competently. However, an effective leader needs to be able to listen to the suggestions and recommendations of employees and other potential advisers, who can provide valuable firsthand insight into their particular tasks and roles.
 
About the Author: With more than three decades of experience in high-level leadership positions, Roy Terracina currently functions as the Chief Executive Officer of Sunshine Ventures, Inc., in San Antonio, Texas. Terracina previously acted as the President and Owner of Sterling Foods, Inc., a leading supplier of foodstuffs for the United States Department of Defense.

San Antonio resident Roy Terracina holds a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Finance from the private Milwaukee-based Marquette University. Establishing a background in business development and investing at Marquette, Roy Terracina has since applied those skills to building multimillion-dollar companies and managing the operations of successful private investment firms like Access Venture Partners of Austin, Texas. Roy Terracina taught at Marquette, St. Mary’s, and Trinity Universities before opening the doors to his San Antonio-based investment business, Sunshine Ventures, Inc.
Accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Marquette University possesses a student body of 11,600, making it the largest private institution of higher education in Wisconsin. Founded in 1881, Marquette comprises 11 schools and colleges, including the Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences and the J. William and Mary Diederich College of Communication, located at the University’s 93-acre campus near downtown Milwaukee. In 2010, Marquette ranked 75th out of the nation’s top 262 national universities and colleges, according to the 2011 edition of the U.S. News & World Report’s America’s Best Colleges list.
In recent months, Marquette University’s academic programs have expanded or earned top research grants, like a $4.75 million, five-year U.S. Department of Education allocation awarded to Marquette’s College of Engineering. The grant will fund four research studies and four development projects into orthopedic disabilities in children. Another grant recently bestowed to a Marquette University program went to Associate Professor Christopher Okunseri of the School of Dentistry, who received $300,000 from the National Institutes of Health to research the dental care provided in U.S. hospital emergency departments.
In other news, Marquette University announced new Doctoral and Master’s degree programs in clinical and translational rehabilitation health science. Operating under the University’s Department of Physical Therapy in the College of Health Sciences, the programs will commence in the fall of 2011.
