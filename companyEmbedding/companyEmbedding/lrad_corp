Fact Sheet





LRAD Corporation is using long-range communication to safely hail and warn, inform and direct, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, establish large safety zones, resolve uncertain situations and save lives on both sides of its proprietary Long Range Acoustic Device® (LRAD®).
Unlike bullhorns, vehicle P.A. systems and conventional loudspeakers that disperse sound in all directions, LRAD’s proprietary audio technology focuses sound in a 15° – 30° beam in front of its Long Range Acoustic Devices, while significantly reducing audio levels behind the devices and in surrounding areas. LRAD broadcasts are safely optimized to the primary human hearing range of 1 – 5 kHz to generate voice messages that are clearly heard and understood from close range to over 5,500 meters.
LRAD systems broadcast live or recorded voice messages with exceptional clarity in any operational scenario. LRAD’s advanced driver and waveguide technology ensures every voice and warning siren broadcast cuts through crowd, engine, and background noise, and is clearly heard and understood, even inside buildings and vehicles.
In uncertain or escalated public safety situations, LRAD fills the critical gap between the limited range and poor intelligibility of bullhorns and vehicle P.A. systems, and kinetic measures including tear gas projectiles, rubber bullets, pepper balls, Tasers, and flash bang grenades. LRAD is not a weapon; LRAD is a highly intelligible long-range communication system and a safer alternative to kinetic force.
LRAD’s omnidirectional ONE VOICE® systems combine warning sirens and highly intelligible voice broadcasts to provide advanced mass notification and public address solutions. Antiquated warning systems sound sirens to alert of approaching danger, but most are incapable of clear voice broadcasts containing critical information about the severity of the situation and recommended actions to protect and save lives. LRAD mass notification systems are also used to communicate to crowds during large, outdoor events and to affected populations throughout emergency situations. LRAD systems are self-contained or easily integrated with existing communications infrastructure.
LRAD broadcasts follow the inverse square law, which teaches that for every doubling of the distance from the sound source, sound intensity diminishes by 6 decibels. Like all loudspeakers, LRAD’s audio output is measured in decibels at a distance of 1 meter in front of the device. According to The American Academy of Audiology, ambulance and fire engine sirens measure over 120 decibels and custom car stereos measure 140 decibels.
LRAD warning sirens are safe and very effective in gaining attention to the voice messages that follow. Contrary to erroneous reports, LRAD is incapable of generating very low frequencies and does not cause nausea or disorientation.
LRAD systems are safe, rugged, reliable, easy to operate and can be temporarily or permanently mounted.
LRAD Corporation maintains a strict policy of selling LRAD systems only to qualified government agencies and commercial security entities. Operators are trained in the device’s operation and use before deployment.
By maintaining a smooth frequency response with an intensity variation of less than 5dB, LRAD has eliminated the shortcomings of competitor systems by preventing audio fading and producing clear, unambiguous communication across all broadcast frequencies.
Each LRAD model is the loudest, most intelligible product in its size and weight category. Additionally, LRAD features a portable capability in a rugged, lightweight waterproof casing, as well as wireless capability and the option to operate the device remotely across an IP-accessible network. LRAD provides communication solutions to meet any operational requirement.
How LRAD is deployed in public, law enforcement and defense applications:
Step 1 – Operator broadcasts directions/instructions in a loud, clear voice

LRAD broadcasts are highly effective in communicating clearly over distance and background noise to individuals, small groups and large crowds.
Prerecorded messages can be broadcast in multiple languages clearly and effectively.
Hailing and warning in an authoritative, highly intelligible voice provides clearly heard and understood instructions and direction.

Step 2 – If direction is not taken, operator then broadcasts a more authoritative message

Deployment of LRAD at increased volume levels can safely influence behavior and create safety zones while preventing the need for the escalation of force (EOF).
Stand down or move to more aggressive stance.

Step 3 – If directions/instructions are not taken, operator employs the LRAD warning tone.

LRAD safely creates increased standoff and safety zones, supports resolution of uncertain situations, and alleviates the use of harmful or deadly force.
LRAD is equipped with a volume control knob. Unlike tear gas, Tasers, rubber bullets, pepper spray and other non-lethal and lethal responses, LRAD is safe and easily modulated.

Step 4 – After employing the above steps, if individuals or crowds persist in unlawful actions, operators are assured they provided clearly heard and understood commands to cease and desist before initiating EOF.
LRAD Advantages:

Performance – Longest range, clearest communication, reliable and demonstrated safe operation.
Flexibility – Scalable, portable and available in several mounting configurations, including an IP-addressable option.
Design – Overcomes background noise to further increase the communication range in any type of terrain and environment.
Controls – Simple to operate, allowing immediate response and process initiation. Single operator use reduces manpower while increasing security coverage.
Escalation of Force – Much safer alternative to non-lethal deterrents when initiating the EOF.
Safety – Creates increased standoff distances to enhance the safety of the public while providing peacekeeping personnel more time to assess and respond appropriately to public safety situations.

LRAD systems clearly, effectively and safely communicate over distance, create large standoff zones, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, alleviate uncertain situations, prevent injuries, and save lives on both sides of the Long Range Acoustic Device.

S/Y Hideaway Using LRAD to Deter Maritime Threats
(Courtesy of Dockwalk)
“Three days into the passage, passing close to land, S/Y Hideaway’s mate spotted two boats on the horizon approaching just after dawn. Having alerted the security team member on watch, Hideaway’s anti-piracy plan was put into action. Broadcasting on VHF channel 16 and using the LRAD, the captain warned the approaching skiffs to stay back. Having seemingly decided the S/Y Hideaway was not the soft target they first appeared to be, the boats broke away, not to be seen again.”

Border Security





Safely & Remotely Securing Borders
Today’s threat environment has placed increasing demands on border security agencies to protect the public, secure borders and appropriately respond to situations ranging from preventing unlawful incursions to providing humanitarian assistance.
Throughout the world, border security agencies are deploying LRAD systems to enhance their ability to safely secure borders, conduct special operations, facilitate search and rescue missions, and interdict and prevent acts of terrorism, human trafficking and drug smuggling.
LRAD’s highly intelligible, multilingual voice and powerful warning tone broadcasts are clearly heard and understood from close range up to 3 kilometers.
LRAD Systems

Safely alert, communicate & deter
Cover more border area with less manpower
Facilitate search & rescue operations in difficult terrain
Humanely steer border crossers to water or aid in remote border areas
Create a virtual acoustic fence
Feature military tested construction & all-weather use
Seamlessly integrate with existing cameras & other sensor systems
Offer a cost effective alternative to fences for isolated areas
Have mobile options & and are simple to operate
Are Safe, Proven & Effective

LRAD systems go anywhere communication is needed. From the hand portable LRAD 100X to larger systems mounted temporarily or permanently on towers, vehicles, trailers or helicopters, LRAD is versatile, self-contained and does not rely on external power or communication infrastructure.
Integrating remotely operated LRAD-RX tower mounted systems with radar, cameras and other sensors provides added security for fenced and unfenced border areas. The ability to remotely hail and warn provides border security agencies a proactive approach to securing borders not available through camera-only solutions.

Mass Notification &  Emergency Warning





LRAD is Revolutionizing Mass Notification with
Highly Intelligible Voice Systems
Until LRAD recently entered the emergency warning mass notification market, highly intelligible voice communication was not available. Standard mass notification installations sound sirens to warn, but nearly all are incapable of broadcasting highly intelligible voice messages containing critical information about the severity, location and expected duration of an emergency, and potentially lifesaving directions. Automated phone calls, emails, text messages, social media and other emergency notification measures are only effective if directories are continually updated. 
LRAD ONE VOICE®
Revolutionary LRAD ONE VOICE systems are advanced mass notification solutions that broadcast warning sirens and exceptionally intelligible voice messages to protect and save lives. LRAD ONE VOICE systems ensure emergency warnings and general announcements are clearly heard and understood throughout coverage areas. LRAD life safety systems warn and communicate critical information to populations not receiving automated phone calls and other emergency notification measures by broadcasting attention-commanding warning sirens and extraordinarily clear voice messages over wind, traffic and background noise up to 12 sq. kilometers from a single installation.
Advanced Technology
Optimized to the primary human hearing range of 1 – 5 kHz, LRAD features advanced driver and waveguide technology to focus broadcasts in a 60° pattern or transmit 360° with uniform area coverage. 
By maintaining a smooth frequency response with an intensity variation of less than 5dB, LRAD has overcome the limitations of competitor systems by preventing audio fading and producing clear, unambiguous communication across all broadcast frequencies. LRAD ONE VOICE systems are the only mass notification solutions that offer several volume control settings to customize broadcast area coverage.
Remotely monitored and activated by TCP/IP, fiber, satellite, Wi-Fi, digital or analog radio, Ethernet or hard wire, LRAD ONE VOICE systems are the most flexible and easily configured mass notification solutions available.
Superior Voice Intelligibility
Based on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Military United Facilities Criteria (UFC) guidelines, the minimum standard for high-powered speaker array (HPSA) mass notification systems is a 0.5 speech transmission index (STI) measurement. 
LRAD ONE VOICE systems feature the highest STI rating in the mass notification industry at 0.95, substantially exceeding all FEMA and UFC voice intelligibility requirements.
LRAD systems are self-contained or easily integrated with existing communications infrastructure. From portable devices to larger systems temporarily or permanently mounted on poles, buildings, trailers, vehicles or helicopters, LRAD systems are highly effective in communicating lifesaving information locally and over large areas before, during, and in the aftermath of disasters and emergency situations.

LRAD 1000RX






  
Remotely Operated 
Security & Response





LRAD 1000RX
Integrated Permanent Perimeter Presence
Designed for integrated applications ranging from maritime vessels to coastal, border and port security solutions, the LRAD 1000RX can be controlled remotely across an IP network enabling system operators to create a fully functional, unmanned perimeter security solution and respond to potential threats from a safe location.
The LRAD 1000RX accepts motion commands from the LRAD controller software through a point and click interface. Simply click on a target and the RX will move to center its acoustic broadcast onto a target. A standard USB joystick (not included) can also be used to control the RX’s motion. LRAD’s easy to use controller interface enables operators to visually identify a potential threat on the live video feed, aim the LRAD and deliver a powerful warning message or deterrent tone from the safety of a command and control center. The RX’s ability to immediately interact with a potential threat remotely gives security personnel more time to assess a situation and properly escalate the use of force if necessary.
Featuring an integrated camera, high-intensity searchlight (optional) and robust, IP-addressable full pan and tilt drive for precise aiming and tracking, the LRAD 1000RX can also be integrated with radar to provide automated intruder alerts. The LRAD 1000RX reduces manpower, false alarms and deadly incidents while providing a highly effective, cost efficient, remote response security solution.


FEATURES

Remotely control all functions through TCP/IP connection
Remotely respond to threats from a safe location
Low power requirements
All-weather use
Fixed infrastructure
Easy to use – Increased coverage with single operator
Increased security coverage
Improved operational efficiency
Increased response capabilities
Safer alternative to non-lethal deterrent measures

DIRECTIONALITY, POWER EFFICIENCY & RANGE

Highly intelligible communication up to 3,000 meters
Safely communicates beyond standoff distances
Clear, long range, directional communication
When integrated with radar, creates a fully functional, automated perimeter presence

Company history[edit]
LRAD was founded in Utah by inventor/entrepreneur Elwood "Woody" Norris as the American Technology Corporation in 1980 (entity # 734088-0142).[3] From 1988 to early 1992 the company was inactive. Norris recapitalized the company as a Delaware Corporation in 1992.[4] In 1996, the company launched its first directed sound technology and began engineering sound solutions for the commercial, government, and military markets. In response to the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, the company's engineering team developed the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD). With the introduction of LRAD systems in 2003, the company entered the acoustic hailing device (AHD) market, followed by the introduction of the omnidirectional ONE VOICE™ Mass Notifications system in 2012. Today, LRAD communication sound systems are being used around the world in diverse applications including fixed and mobile military deployments, maritime security, critical infrastructure and perimeter security, commercial security, border and port security, law enforcement and emergency responder communications, and wildlife preservation and control.

Company history[edit]
LRAD was founded in Utah by inventor/entrepreneur Elwood "Woody" Norris as the American Technology Corporation in 1980 (entity # 734088-0142).[3] From 1988 to early 1992 the company was inactive. Norris recapitalized the company as a Delaware Corporation in 1992.[4] In 1996, the company launched its first directed sound technology and began engineering sound solutions for the commercial, government, and military markets. In response to the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, the company's engineering team developed the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD). With the introduction of LRAD systems in 2003, the company entered the acoustic hailing device (AHD) market, followed by the introduction of the omnidirectional ONE VOICE™ Mass Notifications system in 2012. Today, LRAD communication sound systems are being used around the world in diverse applications including fixed and mobile military deployments, maritime security, critical infrastructure and perimeter security, commercial security, border and port security, law enforcement and emergency responder communications, and wildlife preservation and control.

					Full Description



LRAD Corporation, incorporated on March 5, 1992, is engaged in the design, development and commercialization of directed sound technologies and products. The Company develops and delivers directed acoustic products that beam, focus and control sound over relatively short and long distances. Its long range acoustic device (LRAD) offers directional long-range acoustic hailing devices (AHDs). The Company offers a product line of directional LRAD products using its technologies. The Company offers a line of omnidirectional LRAD ONE VOICE speakers. Unlike its directional products, which have a narrow 15 to 30 degree beam of sound, the omnidirectional line offers products that project sound from 60 to 360 degrees to meet the needs of the global mass notification marketplace. As of September 30, 2016, the Company offered a range of directional and omnidirectional sound products, which met a range of requirements from communicating with and deterring threats over distances up to 600 meters with its hand-held LRAD 100X to distances up to 5,500 meters with its LRAD 2000X.The Company's LRAD is deployed by the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as international military services and commercial maritime, commercial security, and public safety organizations around the globe. As of September 30, 2016, its LRAD hailing, notification and warning systems featured a 15 to 30 degree acoustic beam and a broadcast range up to 5,500 meters. Its LRAD systems also feature a construction that allows its products to meet the environmental requirements of military applications. Its LRAD systems broadcast voice communications, prerecorded messages in multiple languages and warning tones to establish safety zones allowing operators time and distance to determine the intent, influence the behavior and gain compliance from approaching vessels, vehicles or personnel. Its LRAD product line provides a range of systems from single user portable to permanently installed, remotely operated units.The Company also offers products with features, such as wireless capability, recordable microphones, integrated and remote electronics packages, and various amplifier configurations. Utilizing its speaker technology developed for its directed products, the Company designed and developed an omnidirectional speaker, the LRAD 360X. The Company's omnidirectional product line also includes various size offerings, a 60-degree unit, a mobile unit mounted on a trailer, and various configurations of amplifiers, power sources, software and other products to meet the needs of the mass notification market. Its LRAD product line includes LRAD Directional Products and LRAD Omnidirectional Products. The Company markets and sells products and services through its sales force based in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin.LRAD Directional ProductsThe LRAD Directional Products include LRAD 100X, LRAD 300X, LRAD 450XL, LRAD 500X, LRAD 500RX, LRAD RXL, LRAD 1000X, LRAD 1000RX and LRAD 2000X. LRAD 100X is a self-contained, battery powered, portable AHD designed for use in a range of mass notification, law enforcement and commercial security applications and is suited for shorter-range perimeter security and communications. LRAD 300X is a lightweight mid-range AHD developed for small vessels and manned and unmanned vehicles and aircraft, and is available with both fully integrated and remotely operated electronics. LRAD 450XL uses a technology to provide output in a smaller form factor with the same level of clarity and intelligibility consistent with its LRAD products. The LRAD 450XL is designed to provide a communication solution for small vessels, military and law enforcement vehicles, remote weapon stations and helicopters. LRAD 500X is lightweight and can be transported to provide security personnel long-range communications and a hailing and warning capability where needed, with a helicopter-mounted version added.The LRAD 500RX engineered and designed on a pan and tilt system to provide remotely controlled security is a lighter and compact version of the LRAD 1000RX. LRAD RXL combines the remotely operated pan and tilt system of the LRAD 500RX, with the XL driver technology included in its LRAD 450XL system. LRAD 1000X can be manually operated to provide long distance hailing and warning with voice communication. LRAD 1000RX is its solution for remotely controlled security. The LRAD 1000RX enables system operators to detect and communicate with a security threat over long distances. As of September 30, 2016, LRAD 2000X broadcasted voice communication that were heard and understood over distances up to 5,500 meters. The LRAD 2000X unit is designed for use in perimeter and border security applications.LRAD Omnidirectional ProductsThe Company's LRAD Omnidirectional Products include LRAD 360X, LRAD 360Xm, LRAD 360XT, LRAD DS-60, LRAD SOUND SHIELD and SoundSaber. LRAD 360X provides 360-degree coverage with features designed specifically for mass notification and emergency warning capabilities. The LRAD 360X is focused on market applications, including tsunami, hurricane, tornado and severe weather warnings, state and local government, campus and industrial facility public address and emergency notification, and military base mass notification and public address. LRAD 360Xm provides the voice clarity of the LRAD 360X over areas not requiring large-scale coverage. Designed for fixed or mobile installations in smaller areas, such as courtyards, parking lots, parks and recreational facilities, the LRAD 360Xm is targeted for deployment during military exercises, at industrial facilities and construction sites, and for activities, such as festivals, parades and sporting events.As of September 30, 2016, LRAD 360XT was a mobile mass notification solution built on a trailer equipped with a telescoping and folding mast able to deploy an LRAD 360X to a maximum height of 30 feet, which provided emergency warnings and instructions where needed with area coverage up to an 850-meter radius. LRAD DS-60 is a 60-degree speaker that can be mounted on various platforms for areas requiring directional mass notification coverage. LRAD SOUND SHIELD is a vehicle mounted speaker system that secures to any armored, very important person (VIP) or other government or corporate vehicle to create a 360-degree deterrent zone to warn and ward off threats. SoundSaber is a 90-degree mass notification system with voice communication that is suited for military base communications, air craft carrier hanger decks and public address applications.The Company competes with Ultra Electronics USSI, IML Sound Commander, Federal Signal Corporation, Whelen Engineering Company Inc., Siemens AG, Acoustic Technology, Inc. and Eaton Corporation.

Danforth, Chief Executive Officer of LRAD Corporation.

LRAD Corp. Gets Thumbs Up From Pentagon

LRAD Corp. said on Sept. 7 that the U.S. Army has made its acoustic hailing device a program of record. The news marks a milestone for the product.
Previously, the Army ordered the devices under urgency orders.
“We look forward to continuing our work with the Army to fully satisfy its [acoustic hailing device] requirements over the next several years,” said Richard Danforth, the company’s new CEO, in a prepared statement.
LRAD said Sept. 7 that it received a $1.16 million Army order for model 500X systems and accessories. The Army split its order between a $915,000 program acquisition and a $246,000 “rapid equipping force” order.
As a program of record, the device gets a line item in the Pentagon budget.
LRAD sound systems send highly directional and highly intelligible sound waves a very long distance. The 500X is able to send sound 2 kilometers, or 1.25 miles. Some have called the devices “sound cannons,” particularly when authorities use them at close range, as in protest or riot conditions.
Stock in LRAD, based in Rancho Bernardo, trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol LRAD.
