14 MB|30 pagesProduct DescriptionDo you LOVE your Erin Condren Lesson Planner, but like neat and orderly lesson plans that are typed?  Well, this template is perfect for you then!

I got my EC Lesson Planner in summer 2014, but couldn't bear the thought of not typing my lesson plans each week.  So, I did lots of measuring and color matching to come up with this template where I could type, print, cut/trim, and tape into my lesson plan pages each week.

You have lots of "versions" to choose from!

Because the company changes up their planner design each year, I have included options to fit the 2016-2017 planner as well as the new 2017-2018 planner color scheme.  Each version includes the following layouts:
1. Last column of boxes merged for notes, student accommodations, etc. (Mac Pages, PDF, MS Word)
2. Last column of boxes is just all boxes like the rest of the layout. (Mac Pages, PDF, MS Word)
