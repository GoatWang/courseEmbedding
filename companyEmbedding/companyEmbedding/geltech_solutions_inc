	GLTCLast: Change: Volume: Questions for Us? We're here with answers. Contact Us Now »Geltech Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB Symbol: GLTC) is an innovative technology company with a highly diversified range of products developed around proprietary and eco-friendly compounds.  For firefighting, we’ve created FireIce®, a product line of unique, high-tech and eco-friendly fire prevention and suppression products.  We also created Soil2O®, designed to significantly reduce water consumption and, under certain conditions, increase agricultural yields. In addition, we also offer Soil2O® Dust Control, a truly revolutionary and unique product that is cost effective and easy to apply, effective on all types of soil for preventing and reducing particulate matter from the air and water. We have also formulated a solution, GT-W14, for dangerous and toxic spills. This product, more often than not, renders most chemical spills inert and/or lowers their official hazardous classification for safer clean up. Patent pending FireIce, which suppresses fires almost as impressively as it prevents ignition, is changing the landscape and mindset of firefighting and residential fire protection. It stops fire in its tracks while consuming up to 10 times less water than current practices.  In addition to its traditional fire applications, FireIce is also deployed globally in direct and indirect attack against wildland fires and municipal fires, as well as electrical and utility events, such as subsurface events and coal fires.The Soil2O product line offers water saving solutions. Farmers can reduce the cost of irrigation. Superintendents can improve turf growth at golf courses. It helps workers mitigate dust at mining and construction sites and helps city officials prevent soil erosion in flood-prone areas.GT-W14 is designed to absorb potentially dangerous spills in seconds and solidify it to allow for easy cleanup and disposal. It is highly effective on both dense and porous surfaces, and its advanced absorbency technology absorbs liquids much faster than traditional spill absorbent products. In independent laboratory testing, GT-W14 also reduced the hazardous chemical rating of multiple industrial fluids, oils, and chemicals that it was applied to and neutralized the PH of several acids and bases with no adverse chemical reactions on any of the fluids tested.Nature doesn’t come without its challenges, and GelTech Solutions overcomes those challenges by bringing cost-effective, environmentally friendly solutions, such as fire protection equipment or dust suppressants, that have the potential to change the world.

This simple additive binds with water and increases water's ability to suppress fire and prevents fire fuel from reigniting.  As one of the strongest fire protection supplies on the market, FireIce is in use at many fire departments throughout the country as supplement to their fire suppression equipment. Most recently, it has been approved by the United States Forest Service for use on the ground and from the air to suppress oncoming wildland fires.  FireIce is not limited to traditional fire grounds. It has been deployed against electrical and utility events, and is used by municipal firefighting agencies for nontoxic fire suppression, contributing to the safety of the public as well as fire personnel. FireIce, used in conjunction with the FireIce Home Defense Unit for home fire protection, provides the homeowner with the latest in fire protection supplies to protect property and structures from the threat of advancing wildfires. Click Here Soil₂O™Soil₂O is a water-saving lawn care product that is an alternative to excessive watering of lawns, plants, crops and distribution to reduce environmental dust. The natural polymer holds 400 times its weight in water and is proven to reduce consumption used in irrigation and dust mitigation. When used in agricultural applications, Soil₂O is added to soil to promote healthy root development and to generate faster seed germination.  Soil₂O binds to water molecules eliminating wasteful runoff, holding valuable water in place for when it’s most needed. Soil₂O Dust Control is also available for use in construction, road work or anywhere dust is a problem, providing a method to keep particulate matter on the ground and out of the air and environment. Soil₂O Soil Cap is a long-term dust and runoff prevention solution intended to stabilize piles by creating a waterproof and durable shell by bonding with the aggregate.  Click Here  GT-W14GT-W14 is highly effective on both dense and porous surfaces, and its advanced absorbency technology absorbs liquids much faster than traditional spill absorbent products.

					Full Description



GelTech Solutions, Inc., incorporated on November 8, 2006, focuses on various environmentally friendly products, such as FireIce products, Soil2O Dust Control products and Soil2O. FireIce products include a line of fire suppression and fire retardant products, and the equipment used for their varied applications, including the Emergency Manhole FireIce Delivery System (EMFIDS), and FireIce Shield, a line of asset protection products. Soil2O Dust Control products include Soil2O Dust Control and Soil2O Soil Cap. Soil2O includes a line of agricultural moisture retention products, including Soil2O Topical and Soil2O Granular.The Company markets FireIce and the related equipment to deploy FireIce to various industry sectors, such as state and federal agencies responsible for protecting property and natural resources from wildfires; municipal fire departments and firefighting agencies responsible for responding to fires primarily in urban areas; utility companies responsible for protecting above ground and underground infrastructure while managing safety for workers and the public, and other industrial and agricultural companies and organizations to protect assets and crop stockpiles. FireIce is a dry powder that when added to water in low concentrations, absorbs water to produce a gel whose viscosity depends on the selected concentration. Within a certain period of time of being mixed with water, FireIce is ready to use and turns into a fire preventing, heat absorbing and fire suppressing gel. FireIce can also be used to suppress and retard fires related to biomass and agricultural stockpiles that routinely spontaneously combust and spread.The FireIce product is dropped from airplanes either directly on wildfires to extinguish them or it is dropped in the path of an advancing wildfire to create a firebreak or to protect property. The Company offers FireIce in a range of colored variations, such as Fugitive Orange (Sunset Orange) and Fugitive Blue (Cool Blue). FireIce is also educted (mixed on the fly), using its FireIce educator, directly into firelines utilizing pumper trucks or fire hydrants to either be sprayed directly on structural fires to suppress them or sprayed on adjacent structures to protect them. In addition, FireIce is also deployed from FireIce fire extinguishers to combat fires in close quarters. FireIce is used by utility companies to protect wooden utility poles and surrounding property either by coating the poles during routine right of way controlled burn maintenance or by extinguishing poles that have ignited. EMFIDS delivers FireIce from custom designed strategically located spray nozzles. EMFIDS can be activated either manually by pressing an activation button on the control panel located in the maintenance vehicle or automatically by a heat sensor located near the opening to the manhole.The Company's product offering under the FireIce Shield line is marketed to plumbers and welders using the product to protect areas in close proximity to welding or soldering. The Company sells FireIce Shield in two liter pressurized canisters for use by police departments and other first responders to protect property and people from fire until fire department personnel can arrive on scene. Soil2O Dust Control is used in a range of commercial and industrial markets with dust control and moisture retention problems, including road construction sites, rock pits, unpaved roadways, landfills and coal piles. Soil2O Soil Cap is a dust control solution designed to stabilize stockpile erosion caused by wind and rain. As of December 31, 2015, the Company marketed two distinct versions of Soil2O: Soil2O Topical, a topically applied version, and Soil2O Granular, that is applied prior to planting.Soil2O Topical is a fine particle blend that is mixed with water and is for use on existing grass and can be applied using any type of spray rig or backpack sprayer. Soil2O Granular can be tilled into the top 4 to 6 inches of the soil to assist in replacing and replanting of grass, including sodding and seeding, and can also be used during the planting of trees, shrubs and annuals. Soil2O products are specially designed for use as a soil conditioner for water and nutrient retention, interior and exterior farming, including growers, turf farms and greenhouses, landscaping, forestry, horticulture and golf course maintenance. Soil2O can be used in the planting of trees, bushes and saplings.The Company competes with Phoschek, Tyco International Ltd., Kidde Fire Fighting, Thermo-Gel, Horticultural Alliance, Inc., Turbo Technologies, Inc. and American Soil Technologies, Inc.
