                                            When I refinanced my car with them I had a great experience. When I opened a credit card with them the person who wrote a check to my current credit card company to transfer the balance left off a digit.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Allianz Global Investors announced today that it has hired Jill Lohrfink 
      to lead the firm’s institutional client business in the United States.
    


      In this role, Jill will serve on the U.S. Executive Committee and will

      strong track record of growing institutional assets and achieving 
      high-quality results for clients. Her insight and expertise will be 
      invaluable as we look to expand our presence in this market.”
    

      Jill brings more than 25 years of industry experience to this role 
      having most recently served as Managing Director, Global Head of 
      Consultant Relations at Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). Prior to

      Director and Senior Portfolio Manager for municipal bonds and preferred 
      stocks. Jill began her career at Kidder Peabody & Co., where she led the 
      team responsible for Short Duration Trading, Underwriting and Sales in 
      the Municipal Bond Department. She holds a BSBA degree in Finance from
