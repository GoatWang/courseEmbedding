J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. Becomes Public Company after 
      Spin-Off from Fidelity National Financial




      Restaurant Company Begins Trading On NYSE Under Symbol JAX
    





September 29, 2015 09:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: JAX), owner and operator of 
      three complementary upscale dining restaurant concepts, announced today 
      the successful completion of its spin-off from Fidelity National 
      Financial (FNF) into an independent publicly-traded company. Effective 
      today, shares of J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. common stock have begun 
      trading “regular way” on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 
      symbol “JAX.”
    


      “For more than 20 years, the J. Alexander’s team has provided its guests 
      quality dining with a contemporary American menu and high levels of 
      customer service in restaurants with an attractive ambiance,” said 
      Lonnie J. Stout II, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc. “Our business plan has evolved to include 
      a collection of restaurant concepts – J. Alexander’s, Stoney River 
      Steakhouse and Grill, and Redlands Grill. With these concepts, we are 
      well-positioned to continue to scale and grow our overall restaurant 
      business in an efficient manner in urban and affluent suburban areas.”
    

      J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc., which presently has 41 restaurants across 
      14 states, recently signed leases to develop two new J. Alexander’s 
      restaurants, one in Lexington, KY and one in Raleigh, NC, and a new 
      Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill in Germantown, TN near Memphis. Stout 
      said the Company also has begun to transition 12 J. Alexander’s to 
      Redlands Grill restaurants, a third concept in the award-winning, 
      upscale collection owned and operated by J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc.
    

      “We are excited with the opportunities these restaurants bring to J. 
      Alexander’s Holdings,” Stout continued. “We want each of our restaurants 
      to be perceived by our guests as a locally-managed, stand-alone dining 
      experience. This differentiation permits us to successfully operate each 
      of our concepts in the same geographic market.
    

      “With the successful completion of this spin-off transaction, we believe 
      that we can more effectively execute on our strategic plans for organic 
      growth. We are confident about the new opportunities ahead in the next 
      chapter of our journey,” Stout added.

      quality upscale dining experience focusing on made-from-scratch menu

      lists.

JAX: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 05/15/2017 settlement date, and J Alexander's Holdings Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 6.42 "days to cover" versus the median component at 4.71. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

jax_10k_2017-03-16_119_376Financial - Cash FlowWe believe that we can fund our growth plan with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and, if necessary, by the use of our credit facility, depending upon the timing of expenditures.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_123_166Financial - Shares / EquityOn October 29, 2015, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 1,500,000 shares of the Companys outstanding common stock over the three years ending October 29, 2018.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_29_35Revenue - ProductHistorically, the percentage of our annual revenues earned during the first and fourth quarters has been higher due, in part, to increased gift card redemptions and increased private dining during the year-end holiday season.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_110_133Financial - ExpenseAdditionally, during fiscal year 2015, we made payments related to transaction costs totaling $7,140 compared to payments of approximately $330 made related to such costs in 2014.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_5_302Revenue - ProductWe plan to execute the following strategies to continue to enhance the awareness of our concepts, grow our revenue and improve our profitability by:
jax_10k_2017-03-16_101_369Financial - ExpenseInterest expense decreased by $1,750 in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of our prepayment of $10,000 of the 12.5%, $20,000 FNF Note payable during December 2014, and the refinancing of the remaining $10,000 of the FNF Note on May 20, 2015 at a substantially lower interest rate.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_110_131Financial - Cash FlowNet cash flows provided by operating activities decreased to $16,010 for 2015 from $17,955 for 2014, a decrease of $1,945.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_173_283Financial - ExpenseFood costs as a percentage of revenues have been somewhat stable with the exception of beef discussed in greater detail below due to our continued focus on procurement efficiencies and menu price adjustments, although no assurance can be made that we can continue to improve our procurement or that we will be able to raise menu prices in the future.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_154_241Revenue - GeographyJudgments made by management about the probable term for each restaurant facility lease affect the payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent expense and the term over which leasehold improvements and assets under capital lease are amortized.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_98_110Financial - ExpenseAdditional general and administrative expense increases were recorded in employee education and training costs, public r
jax_10k_2017-03-16_150_229Other - OtherThe assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_90_94Revenue - ProductAt J. Alexanders  Redlands Grill, the average check per guest, including alcoholic beverage sales, increased by 3.8% to $30.82 in 2015 from $29.69 in 2014.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_91_98Revenue - ProductAt Stoney River, the average check per guest, including alcoholic beverage sales, increased by 1.5% to $45.99 in 2015 from $45.31 in 2014.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_102_123Financial - IncomeIn 2014, income tax expense was lower due to the partnership status of J. Alexanders Holdings, LLC.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_87_87Revenue - ProductNet sales increased by $15,681, or 7.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in same store sales at Stoney River of $2,317, an increase in same store sales at J. Alexanders and Redlands Grill restaurants of $9,129 and the impact of a new J. Alexanders restaurant which opened in Columbus, Ohio during November 2014 which contributed an increase of $4,235 in its first full year of operations.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_4_20Revenue - ProductOur net sales growth since 2009 has allowed us to invest significant amounts of capital to drive growth through the continuous improvement of existing locations, the development of plans to open new restaurants, and the hiring of personnel to support our growth plans.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_173_287Financial - ExpenseCosts for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance all impact our occupancy costs.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_56_61Revenue - ProductThe increase in 2016 was due primarily to the effect of lower sales in the J. Alexanders  Redlands Grill same store base of restaurants combined with higher labor costs, additional depreciation and amortization of restaurant equipment as a result of the opening of two new restaurants and the remodeling of other restaurants and increases in certain other operating expenses such as complimentary guest meals and contract services.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_173_281Financial - ExpenseHowever, the impact of inflation on labor, food, energy and occupancy costs could, in the future, significantly impact our operations.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_110_135Financial - ExpenseThe aforementioned operating cash outflows were partially offset by a reduction of cash paid relative to interest expense of $3,901 as a substantial portion of interest outstanding on the FNF Note was paid during the fourth quarter of 2014 and a comparatively smaller portion of interest relative to such note paid in 2015 in conjunction with the refinancing of this debt with a new term loan at a substantially lower interest rate.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_122_163Financial - EarningsUnder the Management Consulting Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA means J. Alexanders Holdings, Inc.s net income loss before interest expense, income tax expense benefit, depreciation and amortization, and adding asset impairment charges and restaurant closing costs, loss on disposals of fixed assets, transaction and integration costs, non-cash compensation, loss from discontinued operations, gain on debt extinguishment and pre-opening expenses.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_65_82Financial - IncomeDuring 2015, income tax expense was lower due to the partnership status of J. Alexanders Holdings, LLC during a significant portion of the year prior to the reorganization transaction mentioned above.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_153_240Financial - ExpenseAllowances for tenant improvements received from lessors are recorded as deferred rent obligations and credited to rent expense over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_125_181Other - OtherEffective December 9, 2014, we executed an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement which encompasses the two existing loans discussed above dated September 3, 2013 and also included a five-year, $15,000 development line of credit.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_2_7Other - OtherOur business plan has evolved over time to include a collection of restaurant concepts dedicated to providing guests with what we believe to be the highest quality food, high levels of professional service and a comfortable ambiance.
jax_10k_2017-03-16_89_93Revenue - ProductExcluding the impact of the extra week in 2015, average weekly same store sales per restaurant totaled $110,600 for the J. Alexanders  Redlands Grill restaurants, an increase of 3.4%, and $69,700 for the Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill restaurants, an increase of 5.3% compared to 2014.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
