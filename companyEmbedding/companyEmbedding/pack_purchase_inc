Fart machines, political toilet paper and fake poop; this is what being a grown-up is all about. Those long childhood days of eating broccoli because you had to, dreaming of a better life filled with waterslides, and staring longingly into candy shops are over. You’ve paid your dues, now welcome to adulthood. You’re free. 

Our grown-up toys, gags and novelties are sure to help you make up for lost time. Stink bombs, shocking gum, fake poop, all the things your mother never let you have are here for your enjoyment. We carry just about every gag and prank you can imagine, from exploding cigarettes to a remote control for your significant other. Just make sure that what you choose to do with your new grown-up toys isn’t technically a misdemeanor.

If you’re not a fan of humor at another’s expense, we also have a wide variety of board games and other grown-up toys. From tamer games like the Game of Things and Loaded Questions to something a little more risqué, we have something for everybody. 

But games and jokes aren’t the extent of our grown-up toys. With high quality vinyl collector dolls and figurines, Amazon.com is the perfect place to find a gift for the comic and movie fans on your gift list. Our figurines include favorite characters from Where the Wild Things Are, Dragon Ball Z, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, classic horror movies, The Hunger Games and even The Munsters. 

Whether you’re grasping at your lost days of childhood or planning a hilarious night of drinks and Cards Against Humanity, Amazon.com has all the grown-up toys you need to pull it off.
