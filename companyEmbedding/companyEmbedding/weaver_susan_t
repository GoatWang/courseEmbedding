DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., Oct. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Addus HomeCare Corporation (NASDAQ:   ADUS), a provider of comprehensive home and community-based personal care services, today announced that it has named Susan T. Weaver, M.D., FACP, and Darin J. Gordon to its Board of Directors. Dr. Weaver serves as the Chief Executive Officer of healthcare services company, C3Healthcare Rx, and formerly served as the Chief Medical Officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC), the state's largest health insurer. Mr. Gordon recently left the State of Tennessee's Division of Health Care Finance and Administration after serving as the division's Chief Executive Officer and Director, which included serving as Director of TennCare, Tennessee's Medicaid program, since 2006 under both Democratic and Republican governors, making him the program's longest serving Director.








Commenting on the announcement, Dirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus, said, "We are pleased and very fortunate to be adding Susan Weaver and Darin Gordon to the Company's Board, two highly accomplished healthcare executives who bring important perspectives and valuable experience to Addus.
"As a result of Susan's tenure at BCBSNC, as well as her hands-on experience as a physician and in hospital management, she has been directly involved in setting up and growing clinically integrated networks, launching start up initiatives and performance programs and using data and analytics to design new models of care and innovative payment methods to move to value-based care. In addition, under Darin's leadership of the successful turnaround of TennCare, the program maintained the lowest cost trend in its history, made significant improvements in quality measures, and has been nationally recognized for innovations in managed care and payment and delivery system reform, including the successful state-wide implementation of a managed long-term services and supports system.
"We expect Susan and Darin to be great additions to Addus's Board, as we work to leverage both the increasing shift to value-based care and growing managed care involvement in the home and community based personal care industry, and we welcome them both to Addus."
Dr. Weaver remarked, "Given the quality care and cost reduction imperatives affecting the full continuum of healthcare under value-based reimbursement models, Addus has a unique opportunity to expand its leadership in the personal care industry, due to its scale, geographic presence, relative technology sophistication and financial strength. I look forward to taking part in helping Addus achieve this and other goals."
Mr. Gordon added, "States across the country are actively grappling with the demands presented by their Medicaid populations for improved quality of care and lower cost. I believe Addus will be the best positioned firm in the personal care sector of the healthcare industry to be part of the solution, which is expected to be very beneficial for patients and healthcare payors and providers and, in turn, the Company's stakeholders."
Prior to joining C3Healthcare Rx, Dr. Weaver was President of Transformation Health Partners, a healthcare consulting company she founded in 2015, after three years of service at BCBSNC. In addition, Dr. Weaver earlier held various executive positions at WakeMed Health & Hospital (Raleigh, NC), including serving as the organization's Executive Vice President of Medical Affairs and Physician Practices. She was a founding member and Executive Director of Alliance Medical Ministry, a not-for-profit organization providing medical care to the working uninsured of Wake County, NC. Weaver earned a M.D. from the Duke University School of Medicine (Durham, NC) and B.S. in Psychology from Duke University, and completed postgraduate training at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). She is board-certified in Internal Medicine and is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians.
In 2006, Mr. Gordon became Director of the Division of Health Care Finance and Administration for the State of Tennessee, an $11 billion health care enterprise that provided services to nearly 1.5 million Tennesseans and which included his responsibilities as Director of TennCare. In addition to Tennessee's Medicaid and CHIP programs, he was responsible for the State's high-risk pool, pharmacy assistance program, e-Health strategy, all payers' claims database as well as its multi-payer payment and delivery system reform initiative. In Mr. Gordon's 18 years with the division – spanning three Governors – he also served as the Director of Managed Care Programs and Chief Financial Officer. He has also been involved in healthcare policy nationally through consultations with states, in his leadership roles in the National Association of Medicaid Directors, including serving as President, and his involvement in a variety of National Governors Association initiatives and task forces.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Weaver has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for North Carolina.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Weaver's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Weaver's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Weaver is Board Certified in:Internal MedicineAccrediting Board: American Board of Internal Medicine ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.

The tragic story of Dr. Samuel Mudd of Maryland, who in 1865 was arrested for his alleged complicity in the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln and sentenced by an illegal military court to a lifetime of hard labor at the American penal colony of Fort Jefferson on the Dry Tortugas.  The unfortunate Mudd, whose only "crime" was to set the broken leg of a mud-caked stranger  who turned out to be John Wilkes Booth  endures the cruelties of the sadistic commandant and the condemnation of the public at large, until his selfless courage during a yellow fever epidemic earns him a pardon by President Andrew Johnson.  The film implicates Lincolns secretary of war Edwin Stanton, whom some conspiracy theorists now believe was behind the assassination plot.

Russellon September 26, 2013Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseIn the 1970's and 1980, the hotel I worked for had 12 movie crews, staying there. Some great movie stars, and a few great actors. "The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd", was a very good movie, and I especially love the scenes I saw shot. Guy Del Russo, was the makeup artist on the film, and a good friend of mine, who died shortly after filming. That makes this movie very special. If you want to know how much this movie means to me. I paid a private individual $99.00, for my copy of the DVD. I say, it was a bargain. This movie, in my opinion, was one of the best performances, by Dennis Weaver, a great actor, who is missed. Also the acting in the best tradition, were Richard Dysart, and Susan Sullivan. I say, get this movie, and see the injustice, this government, imposed on one very great man, played by a great man. This one's for you Guy. J. Russell, "Marty", Savannah, GeorgiaRead more0Comment|

Knappon November 28, 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseA arrest and trial of a man supposedly innocent, but history says otherwise because he treated the accused assassin Booth's broken leg after shooting President Lincoln.

Dennis Weaver as Dr. Mudd and Susan Sullivan as his wife are virtually flawless in their respective roles. I've only had it for 2 months and have watched it twice; once myself and again when friends came over a week later and wanted to see it and THEY loved it so much that they ordered a copy.  It's well worth getting!!I also reccommend PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND,it's an older MUDD type video,now available on another website, but a great flick.Read more0Comment|

Alexanderon November 11, 2007Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseA wonderful performance by All the Players taking part in this chunk of history, as astonishing as; "The Prisoner of Shark Island." To quote from James Swanson's informative and meticulously researched book 'Manhunt' - Asia Booth's (John Wilkes Booth's sister) loving memory to her brother closes with a graveside elegy: "But, granting that he died in vain, yet gave his all on earth, youth, beauty, manhood, a great human love, the certainty of excellence in his profession,a powerful brain, the strength of an athlete, health and great wealth, for 'his cause.' This man was noble in life, he periled his immortal soul, and he was brave in death. Already his hidden remains are given Christian burial, and strangers have piled his grave with flowers." "'So runs the world away.'"Read more0Comment|
