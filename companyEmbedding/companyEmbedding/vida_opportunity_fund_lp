Without limiting the foregoing, the Website is not available to persons under age 18. By accessing and using the Website, you accept, without qualification, these Terms of Use. If you do not approve and accept these Terms of Use without qualification, you should exit the Website immediately.

The Website is for your personal and non-commercial use. The Firm grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited personal license to access and use the Website, conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms of Use. You may not modify, copy (except as set forth below), distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the Website. You may not link other websites to the Website without the Firm's prior written permission. You may print one hard copy of the information and download one temporary copy of the information into one single computer's memory solely for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for distribution, provided that all relevant copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices are kept intact. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the Website. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact the Firm immediately for a new password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions taken by such third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted) areas of the Website is confidential and private and you may not disclose or distribute such information to any other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your investment activities.
You are prohibited from using the Website to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Website for any purpose without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may not take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Website or any activities conducted on the Website, or bypass any measures that we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Website. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

 
NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The information on the Website is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of the Firm's financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Website should not be construed as the Firm's endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Website, and the Firm urges you to make sure that you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Website. You should evaluate the information made available through the Website, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information.

 

The Firm's services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients' other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. The Firm advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.

 

You acknowledge that any of your requests for information are unsolicited and any information shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice from the Firm to you or to form an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship between you and the Firm or any of its affiliates or employees. The Firm strongly recommends that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. The Firm does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. The Firm may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Website.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE
The performance data presented on the Website reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees and incentive fees and allocations.

 

The Firm believes that the performance shown on the Website was generated with an investment philosophy and methodology similar to that described in the funds' respective Confidential Offering Circulars and Private Offering Memoranda and that the Firm would expect to use in the future. Future investments, however, will be made under different economic conditions and in different securities and may be made using different investment strategies than were used during the times discussed herein. Furthermore, the performance discussed herein reflects investment of limited funds for a limited period of time and does not reflect performance in different economic or market cycles. You should not assume that any fund that the Firm advises will experience returns, if any, comparable to those described herein. Past performance does not indicate future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund's financial statements for the current year are audited.

 

The Firm believes that comparing each fund's performance to any single market index or other benchmark is or may be inappropriate. These indices and benchmarks are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices and benchmarks, each fund's portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, futures and other commodity interests and currencies, and may include short sales of securities, margin trading, securities of smaller capitalization companies and types of securities that are different than those reflected in these indices and benchmarks, and is not as diversified as these indices and benchmarks. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund's portfolio and these indices and benchmarks, the Firm cautions potential investors that no such index or other benchmark is directly comparable to any fund.

Overview
We have adopted general policies and procedures concerning confidentiality, proprietary data and privacy of customer personal information, and the information we gather over the Website is protected by those policies and procedures. Generally, we collect non-public personal information about our clients and investors from the following sources:

Information received from clients or investors on applications or other forms, including the information we collect on the Website, and
Information about clients' or investors' transactions with us, our affiliates or others.

Our policy is that:

We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our current or former clients or investors to anyone, except as permitted by law. We share non-public personal information with certain service providers, to the extent permitted by law, and we require those service providers to keep the non-public information confidential.
We restrict access to non-public personal information about our clients and investors to employees and service providers who need to know that information to provide services to our clients.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard clients' and investors' personal information.


Collection of Information
In general, you can browse the non-password-protected sections of the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We automatically track certain information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language and one or more files that may uniquely identify your browser. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our clients. This information may include the URL from which you just came (whether this URL is on the Website or not), to which URL you next go (whether this URL is on the Website or not), your computer browser information and your IP address. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

 

We also may use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyze our web page flow, measure effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. We use cookies to better understand how people interact with us.

 

If you apply for a password to access password-restricted areas on this Website, you must provide to us your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, personal financial data, investment portfolio and other investment information.
 Use and Disclosure of Information
We use the information we collect from our browser and data collection devices such as cookies to improve our operations and facilitate the services you request. We may use information collected from you to measure interest, customize your experience and enforce our Terms of Use. If you apply for a password, we use that data to determine whether you are an accredited investor and have sufficient sophistication, investment experience and wealth to receive information about certain investment options. We may use your information to send correspondence and perform services on your behalf in connection with investment related activities.

 

You agree that we may use personal information about you to analyze Website usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize the Website's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Website and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Website.

 

In connection with providing our services, it also may be necessary for us to share information with other third parties to help us process transactions relating to your account, including, but not limited to, asset transfers from a financial institution and processing or administering investment transactions and portfolios. In certain instances, we may contract with third parties that are not affiliated with us to perform services for us, and, if necessary, we may disclose information about you to those third parties solely for the purpose of carrying out their assigned responsibilities. In those circumstances, we require such third parties to treat your private information with the same degree of confidentiality that we do. In some instances, the third-party service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to a service provider directly, their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

 

We may also share information about you if we believe that disclosure is required under law. For example, we may need to disclose information in response to a subpoena or to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities.

 

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not described in this Privacy Policy. For example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or service providers may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Website.

The Website is for your personal and non-commercial use. The Firm grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited personal license to access and use the Website, conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms of Use. You may not modify, copy (except as set forth below), distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the Website. You may not link other websites to the Website without the Firm's prior written permission. You may print one hard copy of the information and download one temporary copy of the information into one single computer's memory solely for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for distribution, provided that all relevant copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices are kept intact. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the Website. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact the Firm immediately for a new password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions taken by such third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted) areas of the Website is confidential and private and you may not disclose or distribute such information to any other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your investment activities.
You are prohibited from using the Website to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Website for any purpose without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may not take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Website or any activities conducted on the Website, or bypass any measures that we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Website. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

 
NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The information on the Website is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of the Firm's financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Website should not be construed as the Firm's endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Website, and the Firm urges you to make sure that you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Website. You should evaluate the information made available through the Website, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information.

 

The Firm's services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients' other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. The Firm advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.

 

You acknowledge that any of your requests for information are unsolicited and any information shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice from the Firm to you or to form an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship between you and the Firm or any of its affiliates or employees. The Firm strongly recommends that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. The Firm does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. The Firm may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Website.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE
The performance data presented on the Website reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees and incentive fees and allocations.

 

The Firm believes that the performance shown on the Website was generated with an investment philosophy and methodology similar to that described in the funds' respective Confidential Offering Circulars and Private Offering Memoranda and that the Firm would expect to use in the future. Future investments, however, will be made under different economic conditions and in different securities and may be made using different investment strategies than were used during the times discussed herein. Furthermore, the performance discussed herein reflects investment of limited funds for a limited period of time and does not reflect performance in different economic or market cycles. You should not assume that any fund that the Firm advises will experience returns, if any, comparable to those described herein. Past performance does not indicate future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund's financial statements for the current year are audited.

 

The Firm believes that comparing each fund's performance to any single market index or other benchmark is or may be inappropriate. These indices and benchmarks are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices and benchmarks, each fund's portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, futures and other commodity interests and currencies, and may include short sales of securities, margin trading, securities of smaller capitalization companies and types of securities that are different than those reflected in these indices and benchmarks, and is not as diversified as these indices and benchmarks. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund's portfolio and these indices and benchmarks, the Firm cautions potential investors that no such index or other benchmark is directly comparable to any fund.

As a condition to your use of the Website, you represent and warrant to, and agree with, the Firm that, all of the information that you provide shall be truthful, accurate and complete.

Privacy Policy
The privacy practices of this Privacy Policy apply to our services available under the domain and subdomains of vidacapitalinc.com (the "Website"). We recognize that privacy is important to our users, so we design and operate our Website with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we may gather when you visit our Website or use our services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we protect, use and disclose your personal information. By visiting the Website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access the Website.

 

By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy is effective when accepted by new users, and is otherwise effective on November 1, 2010, for all users.

 
Overview
We have adopted general policies and procedures concerning confidentiality, proprietary data and privacy of customer personal information, and the information we gather over the Website is protected by those policies and procedures. Generally, we collect non-public personal information about our clients and investors from the following sources:

Information received from clients or investors on applications or other forms, including the information we collect on the Website, and
Information about clients' or investors' transactions with us, our affiliates or others.

Our policy is that:

We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our current or former clients or investors to anyone, except as permitted by law. We share non-public personal information with certain service providers, to the extent permitted by law, and we require those service providers to keep the non-public information confidential.
We restrict access to non-public personal information about our clients and investors to employees and service providers who need to know that information to provide services to our clients.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard clients' and investors' personal information.


Collection of Information
In general, you can browse the non-password-protected sections of the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We automatically track certain information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language and one or more files that may uniquely identify your browser. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our clients. This information may include the URL from which you just came (whether this URL is on the Website or not), to which URL you next go (whether this URL is on the Website or not), your computer browser information and your IP address. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

 

We also may use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyze our web page flow, measure effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. We use cookies to better understand how people interact with us.

 

If you apply for a password to access password-restricted areas on this Website, you must provide to us your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, personal financial data, investment portfolio and other investment information.
 Use and Disclosure of Information
We use the information we collect from our browser and data collection devices such as cookies to improve our operations and facilitate the services you request. We may use information collected from you to measure interest, customize your experience and enforce our Terms of Use. If you apply for a password, we use that data to determine whether you are an accredited investor and have sufficient sophistication, investment experience and wealth to receive information about certain investment options. We may use your information to send correspondence and perform services on your behalf in connection with investment related activities.

 

You agree that we may use personal information about you to analyze Website usage, improve our content and product offerings and customize the Website's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Website and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Website.

 

In connection with providing our services, it also may be necessary for us to share information with other third parties to help us process transactions relating to your account, including, but not limited to, asset transfers from a financial institution and processing or administering investment transactions and portfolios. In certain instances, we may contract with third parties that are not affiliated with us to perform services for us, and, if necessary, we may disclose information about you to those third parties solely for the purpose of carrying out their assigned responsibilities. In those circumstances, we require such third parties to treat your private information with the same degree of confidentiality that we do. In some instances, the third-party service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to a service provider directly, their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

 

We may also share information about you if we believe that disclosure is required under law. For example, we may need to disclose information in response to a subpoena or to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities.

 

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not described in this Privacy Policy. For example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or service providers may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Website. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

 
Control of Your Password and Personal Information
You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name and password. Therefore, we recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of this Website. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact us immediately for a new password.

 

You can review and change the information that you submit to us by contacting us at investorservices@vidacapitalinc.com. You can change your User ID, email address, contact information, financial information, other personal information and user preferences. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.

 

On your request, we will deactivate your password and remove your contact information and financial information from our active databases. Your password will be deactivated promptly based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy.

 

We will retain in our files the personal information you have asked us to remove from our active databases to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and comply with legal requirements. Therefore, you should not expect that your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will only be available to select employees, service providers and governmental persons or entities.

 
Security
Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, which may include encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

 
Children
Persons under age 18 are not eligible to use the Website.
Conditions Of Use
If you choose to visit the Website, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of Texas. If you have any concern about privacy, please send a thorough description.
Changes to this policy
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Website. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Website.
