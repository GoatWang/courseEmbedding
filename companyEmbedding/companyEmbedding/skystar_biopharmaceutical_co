Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Skystar Bio-Pharmaceutical (CGPN) Develops Over 20 New Microorganism Products  











Tweet








7/9/2007 11:01:22 AM



    XI'AN, CHINA, July 9 /Xinhua-PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Skystar Bio-Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  ("Skystar"), a leading bio-pharmaceutical company in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), today announced that it has successfully developed over 20 new products for livestock and aquatic animals with the drug-resistant microorganism lactobacillus acidophilus ("L. acidophilus"). The launch of these new products is expected to add over $550,000 to the company's annual revenue.
    L. acidophilus is a commonly used probiotic, or "friendly" bacteria that protects against the entrance and proliferation of disease-causing organisms. The new products, developed with L. acidophilus, have a high activity of microbial strains, strong drug resistance and outstanding stability. In particular, two of the products include a highly active microorganism density of Condensed Tianji 888 and Condensed Tianji 999, which are produced using freeze-dry technology and contain as much as 10 billion CFU per gram of L. acidophilus. Skystar will launch the L. acidophilus microorganisms for both aquaculture and livestock by the end of third quarter in 2007 after gaining production approval from the Ministry of Agriculture.
    Notably, the new microorganisms inaugurated Skystar's product line for use in aquaculture. Fish farming is increasingly replacing commercial fishing operations which have caused widespread overfishing resulting in strong demand for aquatic forage and feed additive products. Demand in China for microorganisms used in aquaculture is estimated to be 100,000 metric tons in 2007.
    "We continue to dedicate our research and development efforts towards developing new products that enhance the quality of animal health and contribute to agriculturists' output," commented Mr. Weibing Lu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Skystar. "Our new products have strong market potential as demand for microorganisms in China is estimated at 300,000 metric tons while only 50,000 metric tons were produced domestically in 2006."
    Skystar's Research and Development team developed these microorganism products with the help of Jiangsu Microorganism Institute ("JMI"), one of the leading research institutes in the bio-pharmaceutical industry in China. JMI has completed over 20 national key research projects and over 200 provincial and municipal research projects and has received more than 20 patents with 5 international patents during its 30 years operating as a research institute. Skystar has 100% of the rights for commercialization of these microorganism products.
    About Skystar Bio-Pharmaceutical

The company's product line consists of more than 100 products with over 50 additional products in the developmental stage. Skystar has formed strategic sales distribution networks throughout China.
