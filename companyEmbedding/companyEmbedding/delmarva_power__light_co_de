Pepco Holdings was a holding company incorporated in February 2001 for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of Conectiv Power Delivery by Potomac Electric Power Company (better known as "Pepco"). The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2002 at which time Pepco and Conectiv became wholly owned subsidiaries of PHI. Conectiv itself had been formed in 1998 to be the holding company of Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL, better known as "Delmarva Power") and Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) in connection with the combination of DPL and ACE. In 2005, PHI resumed the use of the Delmarva Power and ACE brands for purposes of operations, with the result that Conectiv Energy was the only remaining Conectiv brand and was restricted for PHI's energy production facilities. Operations of the various companies controlled by Pepco Holdings take place in the Mid-Atlantic states of the United States. Pepco serves Washington, D.C. and its Maryland suburbs, Delmarva Power serves the Delaware and Maryland portions of the Delmarva Peninsula, and Atlantic City Electric serves South Jersey.[1] In 2008, Delmarva Power sold its service area in the Virginia portion of the peninsula to A&N Electric Cooperative and Old Dominion Electric Cooperative for $44 million.[2] In April 2010, Conectiv Energy was sold to Calpine Corporation.[3]
Pepco Holdings was placed at 283rd on the 2006 Fortune 500, a list of American companies ranked by gross revenue. In 2010, the company paid only 10% of the taxes it had paid in the previous year, dropping from US$104 million to US$11 million.[4] The company experienced a doubling of operating profit in 2011, in part due to approved utility rate increases in the states of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey along with Washington, DC.[4]

Merger with Exelon[edit]
Exelon announced the proposed purchase of Pepco Holdings, Inc on April 30, 2014. The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators. On March 23, 2016, the merger with Exelon was approved by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, under a revised set of terms. The merger was completed on that same day.[5]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Pepco Holdings for spending $3.76 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $508 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $882 million and increasing executive pay by 118% to $9.7 million in 2010 for the top 5 executives.[6]

Restatement[edit]
In 2006, Pepco Holdings restated its previously reported consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, to correct the accounting for certain deferred compensation arrangements.[7]

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksHome Depot® Official SiteSave on Lighting, LEDs and More!Buy Online and Pick Up in Store!www.HomeDepot.com/Lighting500,000+ Items Ship FreeSavings CenterFree In Store PickupFind a Store Near YouAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Delmarva Power & Light CoRoute 273 Eagles Run RdNewark, DE 19702(302) 454-0317Electric CompaniesGas CompaniesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection2. Delmarva Power & Light Co800 N King St Ste 400Wilmington, DE 19895(302) 454-0300Electric CompaniesGas CompaniesWebsiteFrom Business: Delmarva Power is a public utility and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pepco Holdings, which provides a range of energy transmission and delivery services to more th…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection3. Delmarva Power & Light Co1624 Jessup StWilmington, DE 19802(302) 652-1553Electric CompaniesWebsiteFrom Business: Delmarva Power provides safe and reliable energy to more than 500,000 electric delivery customers in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
