sUnivision, Televisa targeted by
Emilio Azcarraga seeking to increase its competitive advantage against threats of Carlos Slim, his most serious rival in the triple play, both are grouped together, create national and international partnerships and leave the world of shopping
In the moments that redefine the rules of telecommunications in Mexico, Televisa is preparing a strategic move: taking control of Univision.
The consortium will be chaired by Emilio Azcarraga in advanced talks for a second try-in-consolidating media conglomerate in the Hispanic television's most important United States.
And though the play look offensive, the fact is that also dyes defensive, considering that Carlos Slim is moving in the acquisition of media and content, not only in Mexico but also in the Spanish speaking world.
What at the end of the day seems to be at stake is which of the two telecommunications giants Mexican-Azcárraga or Slim-assume the dominant position when completed in recognition of their infrastructure for triple play: voice, data and video.
And in recent months is the activity of Televisa notorious for taking a better position in the telephony world, dominated by Telmex and Telcel.
The acquisition of a stake of 40 percent in Nextel and strategic alliances with Telefonica and Megacable to operate the fiber optic CFE, make clear that the interests of Emilio Azcarraga are in open confrontation with Carlos Slim.
But the chairman of Grupo Carso is not idle. And although he was not authorizing the transmission of television across their networks of copper and optical fiber content partnerships continue to move in the Spanish speaking world.
And the alliance known as MVS Joaquín Vargas, has been very cautiously adding a strategic agreement with TV Azteca.
Some analysts attribute this rapprochement between Carlos Slim Ricardo Salinas Pliego and the escalation of clashes between the station of San Angel and Ajusco.
-> It's created for John G. Perenchio
Some have already reached the courts, as the lawsuit filed by TV Azteca against the submissions 21, Nextel and Televisa wins a national 30 megahertz block with an initial payment of $ 14 million and amortization to 20 years, value of the inflation, one thousand 439 million dollars.
But perhaps the most obvious dispute, which is projected on the screens, is that they hold for some months the two television stations that had a pact not to "steal" their exclusive artists.
The most recent case was that of the host Laura Bozzo, the famous "Miss Laura", who with a rising program in TV Azteca, this week announced his sudden change to Televisa.
The same thing happened months ago with Silvia Navarro, Alan Tacher and Lizzette, identified as unique star who emigrated TV Azteca Televisa suddenly.
Televisa TV Azteca only recognized out of the singer Dulce.
But Carlos Slim Helu alliances are not limited to Mexican broadcasters or producers.
It is known in South America that the Mexican telecommunications magnate would be seeking to acquire strategic positions in some television in Colombia, Argentina, Chile and even Venezuela.
Especially now that some South American soap operas like "Cartel de los Sapos", "Killer Women" and "The Capo" to name a few, are of sufficient quality to conquer markets not only in Mexico but also in U.S. Hispanic communities together.
Hence the warning from Televisa executives and their decision to return to the negotiating table for the second time the purchase of Univision.
This is given to the possibility that Carlos Slim may come forward to bid for the Spanish television station, which although has a very large audience, present poor financial results as a product of unsurpassed economic crisis in America.
And that is perhaps one of the reasons that Televisa would be sitting at the table of negotiations with the consortium to have contracts that will leave $ 180 million a year, but with the large holding legal disputes over the control and dissemination of its contents.
-> Site for John G. Perenchio
A long and bitter history
The love-hate relationship between Televisa and Univision dates from 1992 when the Mexican television contracts signed with American programming exclusive use for 25 years.
But the conflict came to a head in 2005 when the largest shareholder, Jerrold Perenchio, Ray Rodriguez beat as president of Univision without proper consultation with their peers veto Televisa.
And although Televisa and Venevision, the Cisneros Group, wielded each 10 per cent stake in Univision, Perenchio, with an equal part, controlled 56 percent of the voting rights in the Council.
The imposition of Ray Rodriguez broke the relationship between the partners. Emilio Azcarraga resigned from the Board of Univision and began a bitter and protracted dispute over broadcasting rights to Televisa's programs in the U.S. chain.
Maturing in 2017, Televisa's lawyers began to seek the cancellation of the contract fincado in violation of signed agreements. And disputes soured even more when you joined the internet broadcasting rights, which were not covered in the original contract.
The constant threat of Mexican programming that Univision would weaken the action.
Jerrold Perenchio eventually relist Univision, Televisa but it was not the highest bidder. The channel leading Spanish-controlled United States ended in 2006 by the Saban group, a consortium led by media mogul Haim Saban.
The incident became a hit of pride for Televisa to strained relations. Counter looking for Univision's shareholders react, but all in vain.
And although in recent years eliminated some differences, tensions continued when Televisa threatened to remove 40 percent of Univision's programming to migrate to other Hispanic networks rivals.
Now is the financial situation of Univision to the global crisis and the urgency of Televisa to consolidate its dominance in television content, which could consummate the dream long cherished by Emilio Azcarraga Jean.
But remember that the soap opera is just beginning, that heroes can become villains and villains into heroes. But above all, that the end may be unexpected.

Televisa and Univision joined forces
Univision has accomplished this year to consolidate itself as the fifth broadcast television network in the United States and even at times lead the audience in prime time against CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox
The chain was born in 1961 with the participation of Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, father of current president of Televisa, and in 1992 was bought by American billionaire Jerrold Perenchio, with minority participation Azcarraga and the Venezuelan group Cisneros.
In 2005, Perenchio sold Univision by 13.700 million to a group of investors led by Haim Saban, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Univision Communications.
The dispute with Televisa and the reduction of advertising revenues in recent years because of the economic crisis, Univision had placed in a delicate position to negotiate the debt of 10.000 million expiring in 2012, which will now on more favorable terms.

Televisa: honor and businesses
The name of Univision to Televisa is a business matter, but also of "honor." At the root of Univision is the footprint of the Azcarraga Dynasty, the grandfather of the current president of Televisa was the founder of Spanish-language TV in the U.S. and his father, who came to control Univision, was forced to sell the company charged operate through prestanombres.
Univision's history is inextricably linked to that of Televisa and if the consortium of Azcarraga could not be absolute master of the American chain limit is due to U.S. laws provide for foreign investment.
Azcarraga Dynasty
In 1961, Mexican Telesistema, chaired by Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, bought in the U.S. two TV channels, one in Los Angeles and one in San Antonio, with the aim of passing in that country programs in Spanish. Both channels started operating in 1962 under the name of Spanish International Network (SIN).
In 1972, Azcarraga Vidaurreta inherited to his son, Azcarraga Milmo, 75% of the shares of INS and the rest passed to Rene Anselmo, American who had worked with the Azcarraga family. Anselmo became the operator. In 1976, Televisa acquired 20% stake in Spanish International Communication Corporation (SICC) and the stations that ran it and the INS expanded its coverage of Hispanic television households. 16 stations in 1979 reached 240 in 1983.
-> Site for John G. Perenchio
The owners of Univision
In 1976, Frank Fouce junior SICC shareholder and son of an associate of Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, filed with the Court a complaint accusing Rene Anselmo, also a shareholder of SICC of being "prestanombres" of Azcarraga Milmo, thanks to which he had control of the company. In 1986, a federal judge ruled that although Azcárraga did not own more than 20% of the shares of SICC, it had "provided the capital to American citizens to finance the seasons." Due to failure, the company had to be sold to Hallmark in 1988 and changed its name to Univision.
With the idea of ??reviving the chain, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo was associated in 1992 with Mr. Cisneros, owner of Venevision, and the U.S. Jerrold Perenchio to buy Univision. Televisa was with 25% share-limit set by EU law for foreigners, Venevision, with another 25% with the remaining Perenchio.
Televisa in 1996 reduced its stake to 19.8%. Subsequently fell to 10.9%, to sell it completely in April 2007 and be bound by Univision only in the area of ??content provision. Previously, in 2006, the majority shareholder, Jerrold Perenchio, Univision was sold to Haim Saban.
Disagreements and accusations
Since the middle of this decade, the administration of Televisa, headed by Emilio Azcarraga Jean (president since 1997), Univision had with disputes related to the provision of programming and royalties. Both companies signed a Program License Agreement (PLA, for its acronym in English) which committed to provide content Televisa 2017. Disagreements and mutual accusations of breach of contract caused arrived to court in 2005.
On Monday of this week, Televisa and Univision announced the renegotiation of the contract. This continued until 2020 with possible extension to 2025, but the main thing is that Televisa shareholder returns to Univision. In return invest $ 200 million U.S. dollars in the company and divest its 50% stake in TuTv, Univision's subsidiary that distributes Internet content, acquires 5% stake in the company. Additionally receives "convertible bonds in the future" in 30% of capital and the right to choose to acquire another 5%, also in the future. Acquires also the right to place three representatives on the board of the company.
U.S. Citizenship
On Monday afternoon it was stated in some media had bought Univision Televisa. Obviously not. Becomes a shareholder with 5% of capital and acquire other privileges "in the future" (no specified time) that could represent an increase of its shareholding, but subject to the laws.
Today, Televisa can not "buy" Univision, the U.S. laws prohibit foreign persons or entities own more than 25% of a company. To achieve more than that percentage, Emilio Azcarraga Jean would have to take American citizenship. Time will tell if that happens and Televisa regains control of Univision.

Biography:
This former owner of Spanish-language television network Univision is known not only for his media business savvy but also for his real estate acquisitions. One of the largest private landowners in Malibu, Calif., according to Forbes, Andrew Jerrold “Jerry” Perenchio, 82, lives in the Bel Air home that was used for establishing shots in “The Beverly Hillbillies.”
Perenchio got his start as a talent agent for Music Corp. of America. He then formed his own company, Chartwell Artists. Perenchio represented the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando. He moved into sports promotion, having a hand in one of the biggest boxing matchups of all time, which pitted Muhammad Ali against Joe Frazier in 1971, Malibu Complete reported.           
In his first foray into television, Perenchio teamed up with producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin to establish Embassy Communications. They sold it to Coca-Cola in 1985 for $485 million.
Perenchio took that money in 1992 and teamed up with Venezuela’s Venevision and Mexico’s Televisa to buy several Spanish language stations, including the fledgling Univision station, then owned by Hallmark. This became the launching pad for Univision Communications, which came to control 80 percent of the Spanish-language television market, according to the International Directory of Business Biographies. Perenchio took the company public in 1996 as its CEO, chairman and controlling shareholder.
As the Italian-American head of a Spanish-language broadcaster who never learned to speak Spanish, Perenchio took heat both from Univision’s audience for his support of anti-immigration Republicans, such as former California Gov. Pete Wilson, and from conservatives, including Michelle Malkin at Free Republic, who criticized his opposition to various California propositions that would ban social services to illegal immigrants and abolish bilingual education. Perenchio’s views drew further criticism from Latinos as Univision grew and merged with the Hispanic Broadcasting Company, which was renamed Univision Radio, the Michigan Daily reported.
Univision sold in 2007 for $12.3 billion, with Perenchio collecting $1.3 billion for his stake, the Los Angeles Times reported. Perenchio is now CEO of Chartwell Partners, a boutique investment and holding firm specializing in media, entertainment and real estate, according to Forbes. Perenchio served as John McCain’s national finance co-chair during the Arizona Republican's 2008 presidential campaign, and he gives more generously to Republicans than Democrats.
Much of Perenchio’s giving has been through the Jerry Perenchio Living Trust.
Living trusts are established so that after one’s death, survivors don’t have to go through probate, the complicated legal process of validating and executing the deceased person’s will via the court system. The larger one’s estate, the more complicated probate is; therefore, a person like Perenchio with a high-value estate potentially saves his family hassle by placing his property in a trust that, upon his death, can be distributed without court supervision and with less public visibility.
