Real-World Example: Sacramento Laundry





Sacramento Laundry required additional transportation capacity to handle the increased volume of its new 60,000-square-foot laundry facility. This meant reliable access to trucks, some of which average 450 miles per day. The trucks needed to be spec’d to fit the special size of loading docks at hotels. Not to be forgotten, the trucks needed to be cost-effective, as the company had just incurred a major capital outlay in its expansion.




We Offered:


Fleet of 28-foot box trucks that met strict California vehicle regulations
Customer spec’d trucks for easier deliveries
Expert service to increase fleet reliability








The Results:


New, efficient vehicles led to a 40% improvement in gas mileage and $20,000 annual fuel savings
99.5% on-time delivery
24/7 access to replacement vehicles 
Improved emissions compliance
