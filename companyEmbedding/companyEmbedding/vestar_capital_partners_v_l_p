VCA Antech, Inc., to Acquire MediMedia Animal Health, LLC, Unit of MediMedia USA, Inc.LOS ANGELES & CARLSTADT, NJ, July 11, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) – VCA Antech, Inc. (NASDAQ Global Select Market: WOOF), a leading animal healthcare company in the United States, and MediMedia USA, Inc., a leading innovative specialty healthcare communications, publishing and medical education company, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for VCA Antech to acquire MediMedia Animal Health, LLC from MediMedia for $146 million in cash. Vetstreet, located in Yardley, Pennsylvania, is the nation's largest provider of online communications, professional education and marketing solutions to the veterinary community and is a subsidiary of MediMedia, a portfolio company of Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. and certain of its affiliates.
The acquisition is conditioned on the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and other customary conditions. Closing is expected between August 2011 and early September 2011.
Bob Antin, Chairman and CEO of VCA Antech, Inc., stated, "We are excited about combining Vetstreet with our existing businesses. We believe that this combination will provide both companies with outstanding growth opportunities. Vetstreet has a history of strong year over year revenue growth including growth of approximately 72% from 2009 to 2010 as well as an estimated growth rate in excess of 50% from 2010 to 2011. Vetstreet's innovative approach to providing valuable services to both veterinarians and pet owners, combined with our considerable presence in both the animal hospital and diagnostic laboratory businesses, will expand the breadth of our product offerings to the veterinary community.
"The long-term synergies provided by combining Vetstreet with our existing businesses are extremely meaningful to each of our three business segments. Vetstreet's online communication tools will help increase client visits to the over 16,000 Antech clients, as well as our own animal hospitals, and strengthen the bond between the pet owner and her veterinarian. Vetstreet's educational services round out the offering to assure that Vetstreet will be the focal point between the pet owner and his or her veterinarian."
Vetstreet currently offers a highly differentiated suite of products and services to the veterinary community, including:

VetInsite Analytics provides data and reports to pharmaceutical and nutritional companies that allow them to track market share at both the local and national level. In addition, Vetstreet executes direct marketing programs in conjunction with the veterinarian to grow product sales and increase traffic to the animal hospital.
Vetstreet will soon launch a veterinarian-supported consumer portal, vetstreet.com, providing education, referral and e-commerce support for the pet owner. Vetstreet's consumer strategy is grounded in promoting the relationship between the pet owner and their veterinarian through direct links to subscribing veterinary practices, including online communication vehicles that serve to strengthen the connection between clients and veterinary hospitals.
Vetstreet Pro, a bundle of communications services for the veterinarian, promotes the connectivity and bond between the practice and the pet owner. Over 4,500 practices located in the US and Canada, with over 20 million active clients, currently use Vetstreet Pro, including practice websites, personalized and secured pet owner portals, automated reminder cards, automated ID cards and practice analytics to increase client visits and drive compliance and persistency in a medically appropriate way.
For over 30 years, Vetlearn and its predecessors have been the leader in providing world-class continuing education to animal health professionals throughout the industry with leading publications such as Compendium, Veterinary Technician and the recently re-launched professional education portal Vetlearn.com. Over 50,000 veterinary professionals have taken part in Vetlearn's continuing education programs.

Mr. Antin continued, "Vetstreet's annual revenues are expected to grow to $55 to $65 million in 2012. The impact on earnings per share is expected to be slightly dilutive (approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per fully diluted share) in the current year and accretive thereafter. I have known and worked with the Vetstreet management team for over 10 years and am excited that the entire team, led by Derrick Kraemer, President, and Jeff Gaidos, Executive Vice President, is expected to continue with Vetstreet following the closing."
Derrick Kraemer, president of Vetstreet, stated, "For years, veterinary professionals and pet owners have valued VCA Antech's dedicated leadership in helping pets reach their full potential through quality practice health care and world-class diagnostic services. Vetstreet is excited to join VCA Antech and to continue to serve the veterinary community with our leading turnkey client communication platform (Vetstreet®) and our industry leading continuing educational portal (Vetlearn.comTM)."
Norm Alpert, Chairman of the MediMedia Management Committee and Managing Director and Co-Founder of Vestar Capital Partners, stated, "We are extremely pleased with this transaction. Vetstreet's president, Derrick Kraemer, and the rest of the Vetstreet team have done a fantastic job growing their business into the industry leader in veterinary practice communication, education and marketing tools, and this transaction with VCA is a validation of this success."
Piper Jaffray & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor to Vetstreet.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
