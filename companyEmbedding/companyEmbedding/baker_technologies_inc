Today’s complex printed circuit boards incorporate varying sizes of high aspect ratio plated through holes, micro vias and blind vias all on the same panel. While these parts can be effectively plated with DC plating at very low current densities, and with specially optimized DC chemistries, the impact on factory capacity can be profound and economically impractical. Pulse Plating is THE solution to improved throughput, better surface-to-hole throwing power, and highly reliable plating.
Whether simple pulse plating or pulse periodic reverse plating, pulse has demonstrated proven benefits in the printed circuit board and many metal finishing applications, especially with precious metals:


• Enhanced throwing power, finer grain structure deposits, improved    metal properties and product reliability 
        • Faster deposition speed and, therefore, higher line capacity



However, pulse plating alone is not a panacea answer to the plating challenges of today’sworld. BTA realizes the need to analyze and optimize the entire“plating system,” the positioning and fixturing of the parts, the chemistry, the tank (cell) design, with it’s particular solution mass transfer capabilities, the power delivery systems and the rectifier. With over 100 combined years of expertise in plating equipment and power electronics,BTA acknowledged thatour missing piece was a chemical specialist.Therefore, eight years ago, we became the only plating equipment system supplier with its own in-house pulse plating development and chemical specialist on staff. BTA is uniquely capable of assisting our clients with the entire plating system and guaranteeing system results:


• Plating tank design and construction 
        • Chemistry optimization and operation
        • Pulse rectifier and waveform optimization 



Experience has shown that for most simpler, less difficult, products that a conventional, single frequency (“square waveform”) type pulse reverse plating system is an appropriate answer. However, for really challenging boards, having very high aspect ratios and multiple features, a multi-frequency, (“complex” waveform) rectifier is the best solution. Regardless of your needs BTA, has the appropriate rectifier and systems’ knowledge for you.

Our equipment offerings for BARREL PLATING are the most diverse in the industry!
Unlike competitors with limited product designs, since 1995 we’ve successfully integrated equipment and
                    technology from our long-term Strategic Partners into our designs and systems. With a significantly broader
                    range of products, we objectively determine the appropriate and cost effective solutions for your particular needs.
BTA has "NO AXE TO GRIND" in the flexible way we approach your Rack System needs and budget.
BTA’s Barrel Plating Equipment Solutions include:


• The patented PLATEXPRESS™ System which is unique in it's
                           ability to provide a more consistent finish with lower operating costs 
                        • The HYBRID System, which utilizes many of the PLATEXPRESS™
                           features, but with traditional barrel/hoist orientation
                        • Stainless steel "mini" hoists **
                        • Steel and Stainless Cantilevered (Side-arm) hoists **
                        • Steel and stainless railrider hoists
                        • Overhead Cranes for high capacity, double barrels
** Available with Environmental Enclosures


Energy-Conserving Designs are a Specialty
By minimizing losses from heated tanks, and dramatically reducing exhaust cfm (often by more than 80%), we deliver significant savings in recurring heated make-up air and energy consumption, especially in Northern U.S. & Canada.
Water-Conserving “Multi-Rinses”™ reduce floorspace and water consumption by >50%. These have been used for years within U.S. “HYBRID” installations. These lines require only a single rinse station on-line, in lieu of 2 and/or 3 station counterflow rinses, thus shortening the line footprint & number of hoists required.
IN-BARREL DRYING - a time-proven, patented system used for years in the U.S. Unlike conventional, centrifugal drying, more delicate parts need not be dumped into spin baskets for placement inside the dryers. Rather, following final on-line rinse, barrel is conveyed to semi-vacuum dryer stations with special, minimal rotational cycle. The barrel dryers are available with automatic covers, to minimize energy losses.

                  Integral to the system’s success is state-of-the-art controls
                  For more than 20 years, we have exclusively utilized AUCOS control systems. All systems are available with:


• Flexible, Production-Scheduling/Optimized Controls 
        • Advanced real-time simulation/verification of layout and
                            capacities
        • Optimized concurrent processing of widely varying process
   recipes and dwell times. Unlike less intelligent “dynamic
             scheduling systems”, there is no need for part/fixture
             storage
          or queue
          • Superior, in-depth fault diagnostics
            • Global, modem service (PC front-end & PLC), available 24/7
              • Extensive part database, enhanced control & traceability
              • Available in UNIX, LINUX & Windows platforms
                • High accuracy infra-red & laser hoist positioning systems

Multi-Frequency WST



Substantial research confirms that a single and unique pulse frequency is required to plate a particular hole diameter in a panel of a particular thickness with 100% throwing power. Since most, if not all panels have multiple hole sizes and/or various size blind vias, it is necessary to have multiple frequencies of pulses to plate each feature size with 100% throwing power. When using a single frequency pulse rectifier a “batch program is commonly used where the plating frequency is changed a number of times during the plating cycle. With this approach, a single frequency is used for some minutes, and then changed to another frequency. This method of batch programming is a way to “average” the plating on the board’s various features; however, once non-uniform plating has begun, it cannot be corrected later in the plating process.
Furthermore, as the aspect ratios increase, the single frequency on a conventional pulse rectifier must also increase to obtain 100% throwing power, however, for very high aspect ratios there is a point beyond which classic PPR waveforms alone are inadequate, and do not achieve 100% throwing power. To overcome the limitations of these single frequency pulse rectifiers, BTA developed its Wave Switching Technology (WST) complex waveform, multi-frequency pulse rectifier, which is specifically designed for advanced technology, multi-featured, high value-added printed circuit boards.


• WST combines the benefits of both pulse and pulse reverse 
                        rectifiers,
   allowing users to program in “rests” within the forward
                        and/or reverse
   pulses. This drastically improves the throwing
                        power on very high
   aspect ratio applicatons. 
                        • WST allows the user to run a multi-frequency waveform with up to
                        five
                           (5) pulse/pulse reverse waveforms each second.
                        • The WST multi-frequency waveform eliminates the need for                        “batching” 
                           cycles and the ongoing demand for process
                        engineering assistance.
                              • 95% of all WST users require only 1 or 2 waveforms for ALL
                              products
   in their factory.
                              • WST eliminates the worries about cable inductance common with
                                 single-frequency, square waveform PPR rectifiers and, therefore,
                                the need for costly coaxial cable.
                              • New and refurbished WST systems are available.
                              • WST Makes pulse plating SIMPLE!!!

PLATEXPRESS™, a recently patented method for barrel plating facilities that eliminates many drawbacks of more conventional barrel systems, enabling one to:                  



• Significantly increase throughput without additional hoists, and the
   reduced efficiencies that come with lines having large numbers of
   hoists in-line 
                        • Improve the uniformity of plating distribution on all the parts within
                           the barrel
                        • Minimize the distance between anode and cathode, thereby
                           reducing energy consumption, with no risk of collision during barrel
                           insertion
                        • Eliminate the need to drag a barrel over others with the
                           consequence of highly concentrated and corrosive substances
                           deteriorating the underlying barrels, exhaust hoods and anode bars
                        • Minimize the fumes from barrels once travelling outside of a tank
                        • Reduce the machine footprint details

PLATEXPRESS System Benefits:


• Higher production vs. traditional plating lines with same operational
   conditions 
        • Faster deposition and improved distribution
        • Lower electrical power consumption
          • Reduced energy (heating) costs
            • Lower solution dragout
              • Water consumption and floorspace requirements reduced by
   >50% details
              • Reduced maintenance costs
                • Lower exhaust emissions and recurring cost of make-up air
