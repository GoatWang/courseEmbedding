STOCKHOLDER
AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT is
entered into as of December 15, 2016 (this “
Agreement ”), by and among GSV Growth Credit
Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “
Company ”) and OCM Growth Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“ OCM
”).
 

WHEREAS, OCM has made a $125.0
million capital commitment (the “ OCM
Commitment ”) to the Company pursuant to that certain
Subscription Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2016 (the “
Subscription Agreement ”);
 

WHEREAS, in connection with the OCM
Commitment, the Company and OCM desire to enter into this Agreement
setting forth certain rights and obligations with respect to the
nomination of directors to the Board of Directors of the Company
(the “ Board ”).

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

 




Section
1.


Board Nomination .



 

(a) For so long as OCM is committed
to fund the Company or otherwise hold shares of common stock of the
Company in an amount equal to, in the aggregate, at least one-third
(33.33%) of the OCM Commitment (the “ OCM
Interests ”) (such time period, the “ OCM
Nomination Period ”), OCM shall have the right to
designate in writing (the “ OCM Nominee Notice
”) a person (the “ OCM Nominee ”)
to stand for election as a member of the Board. Subject to Section
1(c) and Section 1(h) hereof, upon receipt of the initial OCM
Nominee Notice, the Board shall nominate the OCM Nominee to serve
as a member of the Board for a three year term ending no earlier
than the 2019 annual meeting of the stockholders (the “
Stockholders ”) of the Company. Thereafter,
subject to Section 1(c) and Section 1(h) and upon the election of
the initial OCM Nominee to the Board, during the OCM Nomination
Period, the Board shall nominate the OCM Nominee to serve as a
member of the Board as part of the Company’s slate of
directors at each annual or special meeting of the Stockholders
(or, if permitted, by any action by written consent of the
Stockholders) at or by which directors of the Company are to be
elected in which the term of any OCM Nominee will expire during the
OCM Nomination Period, and recommend that the Stockholders vote to
elect the OCM Nominee at each such meeting or by such written
consent.
 

(b) Subject to Section 1(f),
vacancies arising through the death, resignation or removal of the
OCM Nominee who was elected or appointed to the Board pursuant to
this Section 1, may be filled by the Board only with an OCM
Nominee, and the director so chosen shall hold office until the
next election or until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or
removal. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1, in the
event that OCM does not designate an OCM Nominee to fill any
vacancy arising through the death, resignation or removal of the
OCM Nominee who was elected or appointed to the Board pursuant to
this Section 1, the Board may reduce the size of the Board pursuant
to the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Amendment and
Restatement (the “ Articles ”) and Bylaws
to eliminate any such vacancy and OCM will continue to have board
observation rights.

Execution
Version
 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 1, OCM shall not be entitled to designate a person
as a nominee to the Board if the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee of the Company reasonably determines in
writing (which determination shall set forth the reasonable grounds
for such determination) that such person would not be qualified
under any applicable law, rule or regulation to serve as a director
of the Company; provided, that in such event, OCM shall be entitled
to designate another person as the OCM Nominee and the provisions
of Section 1 shall apply to such alternate person. Only the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company shall
have the right to object to any OCM Nominee.
 

(d) During the OCM Nomination
Period, the Company shall notify OCM in writing of the date on
which proxy materials are expected to be mailed by the Company in
connection with an election of directors at an annual or special
meeting of the Stockholders that includes the election of the OCM
Nominee at least 30 days prior to such expected mailing date.
Following receipt of such Company notice, OCM shall deliver an OCM
Nominee Notice setting forth (i) the name and address of the OCM
Nominee and (ii) the information required for director nominees
under Items 401, 403 and 404 of Regulation S-K under the federal
securities laws. The Company shall provide OCM with a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments on any portion of the
proxy materials relating to the OCM Nominee and the rights and
obligations provided under this Agreement and to discuss any such
comments with the Company. The Company shall include OCM’s
reasonable comments in the proxy materials relating to such
matters. The Company shall notify OCM of any opposition to an OCM
Nominee sufficiently in advance of the date on which such proxy
materials are to be mailed by the Company in connection with such
election of directors so as to enable OCM to propose a replacement
OCM Nominee, if necessary, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
 

(e) In the event that the
Stockholders fail to elect or consent to an OCM Nominee, (i) OCM
shall be entitled to designate another person as the OCM Nominee
and the provisions of Section 1 shall apply to such alternate
person and (ii) the Company shall promptly appoint the OCM Nominee
to the vacancy on the Board created by the Stockholders failure to
elect or consent to an OCM Nominee. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall the Company be required to nominate or appoint an
OCM Nominee to the Board if the Stockholders have failed to elect
or consent to such OCM Nominee.

 

(f) In the event that OCM ceases to
have the right to designate a person to serve as a director
pursuant to this Section 1, OCM shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause the applicable OCM Nominee to resign immediately to the
extent consistent with such OCM Nominee’s fiduciary
duties.

 

(g) The Company agrees that at all
times during the OCM Nomination Period (i) subject to applicable
legal requirements, the Company’s Articles and Bylaws shall
accommodate, be subject to, and shall not in any way conflict with,
OCM’s rights and obligations set forth herein and (ii) the
Company shall not enter into any other agreements or understandings
that in any way conflict with OCM’s rights and obligations
set forth herein; provided, however, if OCM has not designated a
person to serve on the Board pursuant to this Section 1, the Board
may reduce the size of the Board to eliminate any vacancies on the
Board as provided in Section 1(b) and OCM will continue to have
board observation rights.

designate an OCM Nominee in accordance with Section 1(b), and
