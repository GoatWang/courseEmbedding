North Tide Capital is a value-oriented investment management company focused on the healthcare industry. We founded our firm in 2005, and operated as a sub-adviser to a multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2005 until 2011. In September 2011, we launched our flagship fund to manage our own capital and that of a select group of like-minded limited partners.Our objective is to compound capital over the long term by managing a concentrated, low net exposure portfolio within a narrowly defined investment universe for which we have a deep understanding. We believe the constantly changing dynamics and complexity of the healthcare industry make it ripe for a strategy like ours that can profit from both winners and losers. We combine disciplined portfolio management with rigorous fundamental research that leverages our considerable experience investing across healthcare over many market cycles. We believe that investing our own capital alongside our partners’ ensures alignment and a focus on long-term success.North Tide is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are based in Boston, MA.
