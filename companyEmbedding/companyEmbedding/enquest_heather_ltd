Welcome to EnQuest


EnQuest is an oil and gas development and production company focused on turning opportunities into value by targeting maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.

EnQuest is one of the largest UK independent oil producers in the UK North Sea and has a presence in Malaysia. EnQuest’s assets include producing oil fields, new developments and a portfolio of discoveries.


            Vision and Strategy
            






                  EnQuest’s 2016 Full Year Results 
                
EnQuest’ CEO Amjad Bseisu said:
“EnQuest further streamlined its operations in 2016 and delivered cash capital expenditure at $609 million and unit opex at $24.6/bbl, both well down on the previous year. Operationally EnQuest worked at high levels of production efficiency and safely delivered production averaging 39,751 Boepd, our highest annual production figure, supporting our financial objectives.

2016 saw the successful restructuring of our balance sheet, designed to strengthen EnQuest’s liquidity position, to reduce the level of its cash debt service obligations and to enable it to bring the Kraken development onstream.

In early 2017, EnQuest securely moored the Kraken FPSO on station in the North Sea, where commissioning work continues on the vessel and the subsea infrastructure; preparations for the handover to operations are ongoing. The project remains below budget and on track to deliver first oil in Q2 2017.

In early 2017, EnQuest and BP announced EnQuest’s proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe oil terminal. The innovative structure of the acquisition recognises EnQuest’s differential strength in managing maturing assets and infrastructure, whilst generating significant potential for future growth.

EnQuest’s combination of integrated technical capabilities and high levels of production efficiency and cost control ideally positions us to create value from assets such as Magnus and from the substantial potential in our existing asset portfolio, with 215 MMboe of net 2P reserves at the end of 2016. Our journey to optimise and increase production and reduce costs continues, with average 2017 production anticipated to be between 45,000 Boepd and 51,000 Boepd. Following delivery of Kraken, EnQuest will begin moving from a period of heavy capital investment into one focused on cash generation and deleveraging the balance sheet.”
As at 21 March 2017

Origins and recent asset base

Origins
On 4 March 2010, EnQuest PLC announced its intention to proceed with the admission of its ordinary shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. Dealings in EnQuest PLC’s ordinary shares subsequently started on 6 April 2010.

EnQuest’s assets, as at April 2010, had previously been owned by Petrofac Limited and Lundin Petroleum, but were demerged from Petrofac and Lundin prior to the start of trading in EnQuest’s shares in April 2010. Since then EnQuest has been completely independent of both Petrofac Limited and Lundin Petroleum AB.

EnQuest asset base at 31 December 2016
Operated assets include Thistle/Deveron, Heather/ Broom, the Dons area, the Greater Kittiwake Area, Scolty/Crathes and Alma/Galia, also the Kraken development; EnQuest also has an interest in the non-operated Alba producing oil field. At the end of December 2016, EnQuest had interests in 25 UK production licences, covering 35 blocks or part blocks and was the operator of 23 of these licences.

EnQuest believes that the UKCS represents a significant hydrocarbon basin, which continues to benefit from an extensive installed infrastructure base and skilled labour. EnQuest believes that its assets offer material organic growth opportunities, driven by exploitation of current infrastructure on the UKCS and the development of low risk near field opportunities.

EnQuest is replicating its model in the UKCS by targeting previously underdeveloped assets in a small number of other maturing regions; complementing its operations and utilising its deep skills in the UK North Sea. In which context, EnQuest has interests in Malaysia where its operated assets include the PM8/Seligi Production Sharing Contract and the Tanjong Baram Risk Services Contract.

Technip Lands Kraken Job for EnQuest 

zoom Technip has been awarded a large engineering, procurement, installation and construction (EPCI) contract by EnQuest for the Kraken development located in the North Sea, 400 kilometers North-East of Aberdeen and 130 kilometers East of Shetland, at a water depth of approximately 120 meters.
Technip’s operating center in Aberdeen, United-Kingdom, will execute the contract.
A number of vessels from the Technip fleet will be utilized for the offshore campaign, including Technip’s Deep Energy, one of the largest pipelay vessels ever built.
The contract covers various project management engineering and installation works, which include:
– fabrication and pipelay of approximately 50km of rigid pipe – 25km of metallurgically clad pipe and 25km of HDPE lined;
– installation of 3 umbilicals totaling 14km;
– installation of 7km of flexible risers and jumpers;
– template and manifold installation at three drill centers;
– diverless tie-ins to pipelines and manifolds;
– pipeline flooding, hydro testing and leak testing.
The Group’s spoolbase in Evanton, United-Kingdom, will weld and load-out the rigid pipe and Technip Umbilicals, Technip’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Newcastle, United-Kingdom, will manufacture the umbilical. All construction work on the project will be undertaken via diverless construction methods.
Bill Morrice, Managing Director of Technip in the UK, said: “We are delighted to have been awarded this contract which builds upon our excellent relationship with EnQuest. Our vast experience in the delivery of efficient, cost-effective solutions for our clients has been recognized once again and we look forward to supporting EnQuest to maximize production from the Kraken field, currently one of the largest developments in the UK North Sea.”

ENQUEST PLC, 21 March 2017.  Results for the year ended 31 December 2016*. 






  17 February 2017
  

  KRAKEN FPSO IN THE FIELD AND HOOKED UP
  
The Kraken Floating Production Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel arrived at the field on Monday 13 February, anticipating good weather conditions. The hook up of the Submerged Turret Production (‘STP’) buoy mooring system, to the FPSO was completed on 15th February and a full rotation test performed so that the vessel is now on station and securely moored.  Commissioning work will continue on the topsides. Reconstruction of the turret area pipework and connection of the risers and umbilicals to the swivel stack is being undertaken followed by commissioning of the subsea infrastructure. Delivery of first oil in Q2 2017 is on track.

  Trading and Operations Update
  
Key 2016 highlights

Production averaged 39,751 Boepd in 2016, up 8.7% on 2015, with production in the UK North Sea up 11.3%
		This was EnQuest’s highest annual production since the company started in 2010. Final production was adversely affected by the shutdown period at the end of the year, where the maintenance shutdown of the Brent Pipeline System took over a week longer than was anticipated, with winter weather also hampering the work necessary to bring production fully back onstream.

Final reported 2016 unit opex is expected to be around the lower end of latest full year guidance range of $25/bbl to $27/bbl.
Reported 2016 cash capex is also expected to be around the lower end of the range, of $620 million to $670 million.
Net debt as at 31 December 2016 expected to be approximately $1.8 billion
