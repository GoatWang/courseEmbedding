In recent years, state laws have made it difficult to impossible to get rid of arrearages; they can't be discharged in bankruptcy, and courts usually will not retroactively cancel them. A spouse or parent who falls on tough times and is unable to make payments should request a temporary modification of the payments before the arrearages build up.

(more...)An investigation of prospective adoptive parents to make sure they are fit to raise a child, required by all states. Common areas of inquiry include financial stability, marital stability, lifestyles and other social factors, physical and mental health and criminal history.

(more...)The legal authority to make decisions affecting a child's interests (legal custody) and the responsibility of taking care of the child (physical custody). When parents separate or divorce, one of the hardest decisions they have to make is which parent will have custody. The most common arrangement is for one parent to have custody (both physical and legal) while the other parent has a right of visitation. But it is not uncommon for the parents to share legal custody, even though one parent has physical custody. The most uncommon arrangement is for the parents to share both legal and physical custody.

(more...)An adult who has been given the legal right by a court to control and care for a minor or her property. Someone who looks after a child's property is called a 'guardian of the estate.' An adult who has legal authority to make personal decisions for the child, including responsibility for his physical, medical and educational needs, is called a 'guardian of the person.' Sometimes just one person will be named to take care of all these tasks. An individual appointed by a court to look after an incapacitated adult may also be known as a guardian, but is more frequently called a conservator.

(more...)Latin for 'friend of the court.' This term describes a person or organization that is not a party to a lawsuit as plaintiff or defendant but that has a strong interest in the case and wants to get its two cents in. For example, the ACLU often submits materials to support a person who claims a violation of civil rights even though that person is represented by a lawyer.

(more...)In some states, a type of marriage in which couples can become legally married by living together for a long period of time, representing themselves as a married couple and intending to be married. Contrary to popular belief, the couple must intend to be married and act as though they are for a common law marriage to take effect -- merely living together for a long time won't do it.

DISSOLUTIONA term used instead of divorce in some states.

						Warning to anyone involved in a case where for example you have family members against you. This lawyer is very unprofessional and will turn on his own clients for money. It sounds like I have a personal problem with him but it was a friend who was his client. He accepted money from his father to stop representing him and lost his case blatantly.

						I needed an aggressive lawyer and i thought i found one when i hired Geoff Carpenter. Boy was i wrong. What i found was a lawyer that is ADD and cannot focus on a single thing. Even during our meeting while i was trying to discuss my file he kept picking up his cell phone and texting with someone. He seems to double talk out of both sides of his mouth to the point where i dont even know what he is saying is true or false. I can only hope that this review, like the many others below, saves someone from the trouble of having to go through what we did. Avoid this joke of a lawyer at all costs. He isnt even fit to fight parking tickets let alone child custody.

						Awesome lawyer but I'll be brutally honest, Geoff does not sugar-coat things. He tells you straight which can come across harsh but you aren't there to make a BFF, you are there for help and that is what you will get. Once you take your emotions off the table you will see that. Of course other lawyers will say he doesn't have a good reputation, he is tough and practices with truth and integrity. Yes at times it did feel like all they cared about was money, but it's the nature of the beast. We have to pay for the services rendered and his rate is very fair. Plus they don't charge you for every little thing like other lawyers do. When you deal with a lawyer and court, you will bleed money, period!  Geoff and his assistant Katie were amazing to deal with and gave me reason and calm in a very tumultuous time in my life. I highly recommend Geoff Carpenter. He went to bat for me, stood up for me and saved me a lot of time, money and stress. I cannot thank him enough. Stellar job!

						Geoffrey is a very unprofessional lawyer who is only motivated by money and does not concern himself with facts and standards of professionalism you would expect from a family law profeasional.  His behavior at court was embarrassing and, I feel was part of the reason for my expensive and unsuccessful result

						Geoff has been great with my case, attentive and an excellent resource. His attention to detail is very good and I was always left with the impression that he had my best interests in mind at all times. His strong legal acumen lead to out of court solutions that saved me thousands of dollars.

						By all means, this is not personal that I wanted to write this review, we all have are good and or bad experience. Honestly, Geoff at the beginning her sounded knowledgeable and will be advocating on your behalf, but as your case progress, it became clear that his # 1 priority is the money. after leaving him, my new lawyer did tell me that he does not have a good reputation amongst other lawyers.

						Geoff has always handled my case with care and compassion. Yes, although his practice is busy, he has always taken the time to respond to me via email even when it is on the weekends. His staff(including the new partners at his office) have always answered my calls/ emails in a reasonable amount of time. I think people need to realize that other's have busy schedules as well. I can understand that sometimes it takes time to get a proper response.

						Geoff acted with genuine concern and compassion at a time when I needed it the most. He kept me informed about the process, was very knowledgeable, straight forward but at the same time showed true empathy and understanding of my circumstances. I appreciate everything Geoff has done for me. He made the transition from a terrible time in my life that much easier and treated me like a friend while maintaining his professionalism. I always felt very confident after speaking with Geoff and would recommend him to anyone looking to resolve their family legal matters.

						Geoff and Katie are two of the most arrogant people I've had the misfortune to deal with. They are pleasant only when taking your money. Do not communicate effectively . Take weeks to get back to you. Basically don't care and won't even apologize for their many short comings. It was a total waste of money and time. Stay away, they are too busy to do their jobs.

						Only interested taint your money and dragging the process out as long as possible. Also likes to incur many additional costs without adding any value or results. Should not be allowed to practice in something as important as family law!

						If you want any hope of securing your rights in the horrible world of family law, Geoff is the person you want representing you. I would have completely lost my kids if he wasn't defending me. Geoff is very intelligent, he's confident, and he knows the law. He likes to win, and isn't intimidated by even the most seasoned lawyers. He focuses on the issues and cuts through all the **** and intimidation tactics that other divorce lawyers try to pull. If anything, the judge reviewing your case will be happy that Geoff doesn't waste his time, and that will get your further ahead. I fully agree with the previous comments that say Geoff is arrogant. He's good at what he does and he knows it. But who would you rather have defending you, an arrogant lawyer who wins, or someone who is incompetent?

						Overall satisfied with his actual work and advice when you receive it, but he is extremely tardy in communication and despite several emails and phone calls simply does not respond to communication, up to 4 weeks and longer with no response, not even to say he is busy and will get back, etc.

						Hard to believe the negative comments are from clients and not people going up against him in court. It was obvious that he cared about me personally and my case, and was the only lawyer I saw who didn't talk to me like I was only useful for making them money.

						Just awful.  He denegrates the legal profession with the way he operates.  His arrogance is unparalleled, his ability matched by every lawyer within 100 km and his morality is easily compromised

						Horrible lawyer and should not be practicing family law. Newly called to the Bar and is unreasonable to deal with. Very arrogant. Doesn't have kids yet, and has no idea what a good parent is... has no compassion.

						The last comment is simply not true. I met wtih Geoff and of course a retainer was discussded, however he took on my case without a retainer and I was never harassed to pay my acccount. He completed the work and I was happy with the result.

						Enduring a battle for child custody ranks as one of the most painful experiences that a family endures and having an experienced legal team on your side is essential. Geoff and his assistant, Katie, couple their legal expertise with a passion to resolve your case with a compassionate understanding. I would heartily recommend Geoff for resolving your family legal problems.

						Geoff Carpenter should not be practicing family law, he does not have children himself but he seems to think he know's what everyone else's children are thinking/feeling.
