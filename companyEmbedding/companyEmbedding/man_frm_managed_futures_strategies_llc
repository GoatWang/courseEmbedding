* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.45% for DXMAX, 2.20% for DXMCX, and 1.20% for DXMIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

What is the Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund and what are the Fund’s objectives?
Back To Top


The Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund is a multi-advisor mutual fund. The Fund’s objective is to seek positive long-term absolute returns with a low correlation to broad equity and fixed income market returns. The Fund is comprised of an actively-managed allocation to select managed futures trading advisors and a fixed income allocation, achieved within a cost efficient structure that does not charge any performance fees.




How is this fund different than a stock or bond investment?
Back To Top


                    Traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds, tend to appreciate only when asset values rise. There are multiple economic scenarios, such as periods of rising interest rates and economic contraction, during which the value of traditional growth investments can be negatively impacted for sustained periods of time. 

Managed futures funds are not solely dependent on rising earnings, a prosperous economy or good news to generate profits. Since the Fund’s trading advisors can take both long and short positions in futures markets around the globe, they can seek potential returns in both rising and falling markets.


 





What is Steben’s role in managing the Fund?
Back To Top


Steben is the Investment Adviser and is responsible for the due diligence, selection and oversight of the Fund’s trading advisors. Steben can increase or reduce the allocation to any of the trading advisors at any time and may terminate a trading advisor at any given time. Steben also oversees the delivery of performance reporting, regular fund updates, and tax reporting information.




What is Steben & Company’s experience as Investment Adviser and sponsor of managed futures funds? 
Back To Top


                    Since 1989, Steben has specialized in screening and selecting managed futures trading advisors. Our flagship managed futures fund has operated continuously since 1990. Our deeply experienced research and risk management team is responsible for running the quantitative and qualitative screening process to cull the universe of potential managers down to the select few with whom we invest. This team brings extensive due diligence and audit experience from such firms as Merrill Lynch, FRM/MAN and Ernst & Young.
                



When was Steben founded?
Back To Top


                    Steben & Company was founded in 1989.
                



What is the Fund’s inception date?
Back To Top


                    The Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund commenced operations on April 1, 2014.




How are managed futures mutual funds different from privately offered managed futures funds (limited partnerships)? 
Back To Top


Both investment vehicles can offer the non-correlation characteristics of managed futures. A limited partnership typically offers monthly liquidity whereas a mutual fund offers daily liquidity. Limited partnerships are generally restricted to high net worth investors (i.e. accredited), typically with high investment minimums. Mutual funds are available to a broader range of investors, with lower minimum investment amounts. Tax reporting for limited partnerships is delivered via a schedule K-1, while most mutual funds deliver tax reporting via a Form 1099. Investing in a limited partnership requires the investor to fill out a subscription document, whereas investing in a mutual fund does not.




What managed futures strategies does the Fund pursue? 
Back To Top


Trading advisors can trade futures and forward contracts in over 200 global markets including currencies, energy, interest rates, equity indices and precious metals. The Fund may access both trend and non-trend following systems. Trend following strategies pursue sustained price trends, regardless of market direction, whereas non-trend strategies tend to focus on other economic models and systems, as well as other time frames.




How is this fund different from other similar funds in the marketplace?
Back To Top


                    The Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund is a multi-advisor fund. This means it does not rely on one trading advisor's system to generate returns (single manager approach). A multi-advisor fund diversifies investor assets across a set of trading advisors selected to manage the Fund's assets towards its stated investment objectives.

In contrast to similar funds, the Steben Managed Futures Strategy Fund has a highly competitive fee structure with no performance fees charged by the underlying trading advisors or by Steben, the Investment Adviser.

 




How are the Trading Advisors selected?
Back To Top


                    The Steben & Company manager selection process is guided by over 25 years of experience. It uses advanced quantitative and qualitative criteria to find what we believe to be the best futures trading advisors from around the world. 

Of the hundreds of trading advisors available, only a small number fit our rigorous selection criteria. The Steben Investment Committee has the ability to change allocations, add or remove trading advisors at any time.

(b)	During certain periods, the Distributor may pay 100% of the sales charge to participating dealers. Otherwise, it will pay the dealer concession shown above.
(c)	A selling broker may receive commissions on purchases of Class A shares over $1 million calculated as follows: 1.00% on purchases between $1 million and $3 million, 0.50% on amounts over $3 million but less than $5 million, 0.25% on amounts over $5 million. The commission rate is determined based on the purchase amount combined with the current market value of existing investments in Class A shares.




Does the Fund pay a dividend?
Back To Top


The Fund pays annual dividends, and does not anticipate paying monthly or quarterly income. It should not be considered an income producing investment vehicle. If an annual dividend is distributed, an investor may choose to reinvest the funds or have them paid out. If investing directly, this option is selected when filling out the Fund’s application form. If investing in a brokerage account, the option is selected through your brokerage account.




What paperwork is required to invest in the Fund?

Campbell  Delaware Feeder LLC Notes to the Financial Statements For the period from 25  February 2015 (date of formation) to 31 December 2015 1. General Campbell  Delaware Feeder LLC (the "Fund") was organised as a Delaware  limited liability company on 25 February 2015. The Fund commenced trading on  1 May 2015. The investment objective of the Fund is to maximize the long-term  total returns to its investors. The Fund invests substantially all of its  investible assets in, and conducts its investment program through a  "master-feeder" structure. The Fund is a �Feeder� fund which  invests into Campbell MAC Cayman Fund Limited (the "Master Fund"),  an exempted company with limited liability registered in the Cayman Islands  under the provisions of the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands.  At 31 December 2015, the Fund held 25.07% of the Master Fund. The most  recent,
applicable Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Fund is dated May  2015 (the �Offering Memorandum�). Campbell & Company, LP (the �Investment  Manager�), a Delaware (U.S.A.) limited partnership, has been appointed to  serve as the Investment Manager of the Master Fund. FRM Investment Management  (USA) LLC is the Commodity Pool Operator of the Fund and the Master Fund and  the Manager and the Risk Manager of the Fund. FRM Investment Management (USA)  LLC is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the �CFTC�)  as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor and is a member of  the U.S. National Futures Association in such capacities. The financial  statements of the Master Fund are attached and should be read in conjunction  with the Fund�s financial statements. 2. Summary of significant accounting  policies The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (�US  GAAP�) and are stated in U.S. Dollars. Management has determined that the  Fund is an investment company in conformity with US GAAP. Therefore the Fund  follows the accounting and reporting guidance for investment companies in the  Financial Accounting Standard Board (�FASB�) ASC946, Financial Services �  Investment Companies (�ASC 946�). The Fund is exempted from preparing a cash  flow statement under ASC 946 as the Fund has no level 3 investments, does not  hold any debt instruments and presents a Statement of Changes in Unitholders�  Capital. a) Use of accounting estimates The preparation of these financial  statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  including certain valuation assumptions. Actual results could differ from  such estimates. b) Recent Accounting Pronouncement In August 2014, the FASB  issued ASU
2014-15, �Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity�s Ability to  Continue as a Going Concern� (�ASU 2014-15�), which provides guidance on  determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the  financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim  and annual assessments of an entity�s ability to continue as a going concern  within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity  must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial  doubt about the entity�s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15  applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after 15  December 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  At the period end, management has not chosen to adopt this ASU and is  evaluating its impact of this ASU; however management does not expect this  change to impact the financial statements. c) Investment in Master
Fund The  Fund�s investment in the Master Fund is recorded at fair value, which is the  Fund�s proportionate interest in the net assets of the Master Fund. The Fund  records its proportionate share of the Master Fund�s income, expenses, and  realised and unrealised gains and losses in the Statement of Operations.  Valuation of the investments held by the Master Fund including, but not  limited to, the valuation techniques used and classification within the fair  value hierarchy of instruments held by the Master Fund are discussed in the  notes to the Master Fund�s financial statements which are attached to these  financial statements. The investment in the Master Fund is carried at fair  value. Under ASC 820, �Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures� fair value is  the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a  liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a three - tier
fair value hierarchy  that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair  value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)  and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three  levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below: � Level  1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the  measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2 -  Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for  which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;  Level 3 - Prices or valuation that requires inputs that are both significant  to the fair value measurement and unobservable. � � 8

Campbell  Delaware Feeder LLC Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) For the  period from 25 February 2015 (date of formation) to 31 December 2015 2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) d) Foreign currency  Items included in the Fund�s financial statements are measured using the  currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the  �Functional Currency�). The financial statements are presented in the  Functional Currency, US Dollars (US$), reflecting the fact that transactions  are denominated primarily in US Dollars. Transactions during the period  denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the rates of  exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. Assets and Liabilities  denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates of exchange in  effect at the date of the Statement of Financial Condition. For investment  transactions
and investments held at the period-end denominated in foreign  currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in the net realised loss  and change in unrealised appreciation from on non-commodity interest  derivatives and foreign currency in the Statement of Operations. The Fund  does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from  changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations  arising from changes in the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations  are included in the net realised loss and change in unrealised depreciation  from derivatives and foreign currency in the Statement of Operations. e) Cash  and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at bank  maturing within three months of the period end date. f) Recognition and  allocation of income or loss The Fund records subscriptions and redemptions  in the Master Fund on the transaction date. The Fund records its weekly  proportionate share
of the Master Fund's income, expenses and change in  realised and unrealised gains and losses. In addition, the Fund accrues its  own income and expenses. The Master Fund�s income and expense recognition and  net gain/(loss) allocation policies are disclosed in the notes to the Master  Fund�s financial statements which are attached to these financial statements.  The Fund allocates weekly income or loss between series of Units of the Fund  after consideration of any prior day accruals for operating expenses and  management fees in the Fund. g) Redemptions payable In accordance with the  authoritative guidance on Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with  Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity under US GAAP, financial  instruments mandatorily redeemable at the option of the holder are classified  as liabilities when a redemption request has been received and the redemption  amount has been determined. Redemption notices received for which the US$�and  unit
amounts are not fixed remain in capital until the net asset value used  to determine the redemption and unit amounts are determined. All of this  amount relates to redemptions due to be paid on the first dealing day of 2016  which under the terms of Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with  characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity are mandatorily redeemable  financial instruments and consequently a liability of the Fund and not part  of equity. h) Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the  net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial Condition when the Fund  has a legally enforceable right to offset and the transactions are intended  to be settled on a net basis or simultaneously. At the period end, no  financial instruments of the Fund are being presented net within the  Statement of Financial Condition of the Fund. i) Taxation ASC 740-10  �Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes � an interpretation of ASC 740  (�ASU
740-10�)� clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  recognised in the Fund�s financial statements in conformity with ASC 740  �Accounting for Income Taxes�. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold  and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and  measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.  Management evaluates such tax positions to determine whether, for all tax  years still subject to assessment or challenge by the relevant taxation  authorities, the tax positions are �more-likely-than-not� to be being  sustained on examination. This evaluation includes the position that further  withholding taxes will not be levied on income already received by the Fund.  Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are  initially recorded and subsequently measured at the largest amount of tax  benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized on ultimate  settlement,
using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting  date. Management has analysed the Fund�s tax positions from commencement of  operations and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in  the Fund�s financial statements. The Fund recognises interest and penalties,  if any, related to unrecognised tax liability as income tax expense in the  statement of operations. During the period ended 31 December 2015, the Fund  did not incur any interest or penalties. The Fund is classified as a  partnership for United States Federal income tax purposes. Consequently, no  provision has been made in the financial statements for United States federal  or state income taxes as any tax liability arising from operations of the  Fund is the responsibility of the Unitholders and not the Fund. j)  Preliminary expenses The Fund has borne its organisational expenses,  including, without limitation, legal, accounting, filing and administration  expenses associated
with the organisation of the Fund and the offering of  Units. For NAV purposes the organisational costs are amortised over the first  three years of trading of the Fund. 9

Fair  value of financial instruments The Fund�s assets and liabilities carried at  fair value have been categorised based up on the fair value hierarchy based  on valuation policy described earlier.

the Master  Fund is managed in accordance with the redemption policy of the Fund as  disclosed in note 6 of the financial statements. The fair value of the Fund�s  assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under  disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments approximates the  carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Financial Condition. 4.

Administration fees The  Fund pays the Administrator an annual administration fee of US$21,500. In  addition, the Administrator receives an additional administration fee from  the Master Fund of up to 0.135% per annum of the Net Asset Value of the Master  Fund. The Administrator�s fees are subject to review from time to time to  reflect changes in the operational cost of administering the Fund. 10

Campbell  Delaware Feeder LLC Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) For the  period from 25 February 2015 (date of formation) to 31 December 2015 7.  Financial highlights The financial highlights disclosed below are for the  period ended 31 December 2015: Series A 2015 US$�Per Unit operation  performance: Net asset value per unit at which Units were initially  subscribed 1,371.77 Change in net assets resulting from operations: Net  investment loss (40.33) Net realised loss and change in unrealised  depreciation from derivatives and foreign currency (38.10) Net decrease in  net assets resulting from operations (78.43) Net asset value per unit at end  of the period 1,293.34 Return (i) Total return before incentive fees  Incentive fees Total return after incentive fees (5.72)% - (5.72)% (ii) Ratio  to average net assets Net investment loss before incentive fees Incentive  fees Net investment
loss after incentive fees (4.81)% - (4.81)% Total  expenses before incentive fees Incentive fees Total expenses after incentive  fees (4.77)% - (4.77)% Non trade expenses(iii) (3.53)% (i) The Total Return  as computed is not annualised. Ratios to average net assets as computed are  annualised. (ii) The financial highlights are calculated for a unit class  taken as a whole. An individual Unitholder�s financial highlights may vary  from the above on the timing of capital transactions and individual  management and incentive fee arrangements. Ratios to average net asset  computed are annualised, as it is related to a period of less than one year.  (iii) This ratio details the total expenses less trading costs (including  interest costs, dividend costs and transaction and brokerage costs) incurred  by the Fund and the Master Fund, in the course of normal trading, to the  average net assets described above. 8. Indemnifications In the normal course  of business, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of  representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications.  The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this  would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not  yet occurred. However, based on experience, management expects the risk of  loss to be remote. 9. Subsequent events Subsequent to 31 December 2015,  Unitholders subscribed US$�1,720,000 and redeemed US$�725,000. In connection  with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements as of 31  December 2015, management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events  on the Fund through 17 March 2016, the date the financial statements were  available to be issued, and has determined that there were no additional  subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial  statements. 12

An audit  involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the disclosures  in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on judgment,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of amounts and  the auditors� the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control  relevant to the entity�s preparation and fair presentation of the financial  statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the entity�s internal control. An audit also includes  evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe  that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the  accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all  material respects, the financial position of Campbell Delaware Feeder LLC at  31 December 2015, and the results of its operations and changes in its  unitholders� capital for the period from 25 February 2015 (date of formation)  to 31 December 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles. 17 March 2016 14 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global  Limited

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31  December 2015 1. General Campbell MAC Cayman Fund Limited (the �Master Fund�)  is an exempted company with limited liability registered in the Cayman  Islands under the provisions of the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands (as  amended). The Master Fund was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on 11  October 2013. The Master Fund is an open-ended mutual fund registered with  the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and regulated under the Mutual Funds  Law of the Cayman Islands (as amended). On 5 March 2015, the Directors  resolved to restructure the Master Fund as a master fund with two separate  feeder funds, Campbell Cayman Feeder (the �Offshore Fund�), a company  incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company and Campbell  Delaware Feeder LLC (the �Onshore fund�), a Delaware limited
liability  company (together with the Offshore Fund, the �Feeder Funds�). The Feeder  Funds will invest all of their assets (to the extent not retained in cash) in  the Master Fund. On 1 May 2015, investors in the Master Fund transferred  their Redeemable Participating Shares in the Master Fund to the Offshore Fund  in consideration for Redeemable Participating Shares in the Offshore Fund.  This transaction had no impact on the value of the investor�s capital. The  investment objective of the Master Fund is to maximise the long-term total  returns to the Redeemable Participating Shareholders by investing in futures,  forwards and related instruments. No assurance can be given that the Master  Fund�s investment objective will be achieved and investment results for the  Master Fund may vary substantially over time. Campbell & Company, LP (the  �Investment Manager�), a Delaware (U.S.A) limited partnership as successor in  interest to Campbell & Company,
Inc., has been appointed to serve as the  Investment Manager of the Master Fund. FRM Investment Management (USA) LLC is  the Commodity Pool Operator of the Master Fund. FRM Investment Management  (USA) LLC is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  �CFTC�) as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor and is a  member of the U.S. National Futures Association in such capacities. Further feeder  funds may be created to invest in the Master Fund. At 31 December 2015, the  Offshore Fund and Onshore Fund held 74.93% and 25.07% respectively of the  Master Fund. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies The financial  statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were prepared in accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards (�IFRS�) issued by the  International Accounting Standards Board (�IASB�). Management has assessed  that there are no material differences between IFRS and United States  Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (�US GAAP�) and has concluded that  US GAAP is more appropriate for the Master Fund preparing the financial  statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and going forward. These  financial statements are therefore prepared in conformity with US GAAP. US  GAAP standard, Accounting Standards Codification (�ASC�) 480, Distinguishing  Liabilities from Equity requires gross redemptions with a dealing date of 1  January 2015 (based on the net asset value per share at 31 December 2014) to  be recorded in the financial statements at 31 December 2014 as �Redemptions  payable�. As a result, redemptions effected after 31 December 2014, but based  upon year end net asset value, of US$10,146,986 are reflected as redemptions  payable in Statement of Financial Condition. Reconciliation of opening net  assets under IFRS to US GAAP is disclosed in Statement of Changes in Net  Assets. Management has determined that the Master Fund is an
investment  company in conformity with US GAAP. Therefore the Master Fund follows the  accounting and reporting guidance for investment companies in the Financial  Accounting Standard Board (�FASB�) ASC946, Financial Services � Investment  Companies (�ASC 946�). The Master Fund is exempted from preparing a cash flow  statement under ASC 946 as the Master Fund has no level 3 investments, does  not hold any debt instruments and presents a Statement of Changes in Net  Assets. The financial statements are stated in US Dollars (�US$�). a) Use of  accounting estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires  management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  in the financial statements and accompanying notes including certain  valuation assumptions. Actual results could differ from such estimates. b)  Recent Accounting Pronouncement In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  �Disclosure of Uncertainties
About an Entity�s Ability to Continue as a Going  Concern� (�ASU 2014-15�), which provides guidance on determining when and how  to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new  standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an  entity�s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date  the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain  disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the  entity�s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all  entities and is effective for annual periods ending after 15 December 2016,  and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. At year end,  management is evaluating the impact of this ASU; however management does not  expect this change to impact the financial statements. 11

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies  (continued) c) Investments transactions and related investment income and  expenses Security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realised  gains and losses are computed using the first-in, first-out method. Interest  income, interest expense and operating expenses are recorded on an accrual  basis. Dividend income, net of applicable withholding taxes and dividend  expenses on securities sold short, are recorded on the ex-dividend date. d)  Fair value of financial instruments Definition and hierarchy Derivative  contracts are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that  would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A  fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques is  used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or  liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs  (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are  described below: � Level 1 � Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that  are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or  liabilities; Level 2 � Quoted prices in markets that are not active or  financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either  directly or indirectly; Level 3 � Prices or valuation that requires inputs  that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. � �  Valuation Investments whose values are based
on quoted market prices in active  markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1, include active listed  equities. The Master Fund does not adjust the quoted price for such  instruments, even in situations where the Master Fund holds a large position  and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. Investments that trade  in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on  quoted market prices for an identical instrument, dealer quotations or  alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified  within Level 2. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded  in active markets and/or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations may  be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non�transferability, which are  generally based on available market information. Investments classified  within Level 3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade  infrequently or not at all. Level 3 instruments include
private placements.  When observable prices are not available for these securities, the Investment  Manager uses one or more valuation techniques e.g., the market approach or  the income approach for which sufficient and reliable data is available.  Within Level 3, the use of the market approach generally consists of using  comparable market transactions, while the use of the income approach  generally consists of the net present value of estimated future cash flows,  adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and /or other risk  factors. The inputs used by the Investment Manager in estimating the value of  Level 3 investments include the original transaction price, recent  transactions in the same or similar instruments, completed or pending  third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable issuers,  subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalisations and other transactions  across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt capital  markets,
and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Level 3 investments  may also be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and /or non-transferability, with  the amount of such discount estimated by the Investment Manager in the  absence of market information. The fair value measurement of Level 3  investments does not include transaction costs that may have been capitalised  as part of the security�s cost basis. Assumptions used by the Investment  Manager due to the lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the  resulting fair value and therefore the Master Fund�s results of operations.  Derivative Instruments can be exchange-traded or privately negotiated  over-the-counter (�OTC�). OTC derivatives are valued by the Master Fund using  observable inputs, such as quotations received from the counterparty, dealers  or brokers, whenever available and considered reliable. In instances where  models are used, the value of an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual  terms
of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the  availability and reliability of observable inputs. These OTC derivatives that  have less liquidity or for which inputs are unobservable are classified  within Level 3. While the valuations of these less liquid OTC derivatives may  utilise some Level 1 and/or Level 2 inputs, they also include other  unobservable inputs which are considered significant to the fair value determination.  At each measurement date, the Investment Manager updates the Level 1 and  Level 2 inputs to reflect observable inputs, though the resulting gains and  losses are reflected within Level 3 due to the significance of the  unobservable inputs. 12

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 2. Summary of significant accounting policies  (continued) e) Foreign currency Items included in the Master Fund�s financial  statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which it operates (the �Functional Currency�). The financial  statements are presented in the Functional Currency, US Dollars (�US$�) and  not the local currency of the Cayman Islands reflecting the fact that  transactions are denominated primarily in US Dollars. Transactions during the  year denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the rates of  exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. Assets and Liabilities  denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates of exchange in  effect at the date of the Statement of Financial Condition.
For investment  transactions and investments held at the year-end denominated in foreign  currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in the net realised gain  and change in unrealised depreciation from non-commodity interest derivatives  and foreign currency in the Statement of Operations. The Master Fund does not  isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in  foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from  changes in the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations are included in  net realised gain and change in unrealised depreciation from derivatives and  foreign currency. f) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents  include cash held at bank and prime brokers maturing within three months of  the year end date. g) Redemptions payable In accordance with the  authoritative guidance on ASC480 �Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity�,  Accounting for Certain financial instruments with
Characteristics of both  Liabilities and Equity under US GAAP, financial instruments mandatorily  redeemable at the option of the holder are classified as liabilities when a redemption  request has been received and the redemption amount has been determined.  Redemption notices received for which the US$�and share amounts are not fixed  remain in capital until the net asset value used to determine the redemption  and share amounts are determined. Accordingly, the Statement of Financial  Condition and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets include redemptions  payable of US$1,356,595. This relates to redemptions due to be paid on the  first dealing day of 2016 which under the terms of Accounting for Certain  financial instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity are  mandatorily redeemable financial instruments and consequently a liability of  the Master Fund and not part of equity. h) Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities  are offset and the
net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial  Condition when the Master Fund has a legally enforceable right to offset and  the transactions are intended to be settled on a net basis or simultaneously.  At the year end no financial instruments of the Master Fund are being  presented net within the Statement of Financial Condition of the Master Fund.  Please refer to note 6. i) Taxation The Cayman Islands currently has no  income, corporation or capital gains tax, no taxes by way of withholding and  no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax. In addition, the Master Fund has  applied for and received from the Governor-in Cabinet of the Cayman Islands  pursuant to The Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, an  undertaking that, for a period of twenty years from the date of the  undertaking, no law which is thereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands  imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations  shall apply to the Master
Fund or its operations. In addition no tax is to be  levied on profits, income, gains or appreciation which is in the nature of  estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable on or in respect of the  shares, debentures or other obligations of the Master Fund. Management evaluates  such tax positions to determine whether, for all tax years still subject to  assessment or challenge by the relevant taxation authorities, the tax  positions are �more-likely-than-not� to be being sustained on examination.  This evaluation includes the position that further withholding taxes will not  be levied on income already received by the Master Fund. Tax positions that  meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are initially recorded  and subsequently measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more  than 50 percent likely of being realized on ultimate settlement, using the  facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. ASC 740-10  �Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes � an interpretation of ASC 740  (�ASU 740-10�) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  recognised in the Master Fund�s financial statements in conformity with ASC  740 �Accounting for Income Taxes� (�ASC 740�). ASC 740-10 prescribes a  recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement  recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken  on a tax return. Management has analysed the Master Fund�s tax positions from  commencement of operations and has concluded that no provision for income tax  is required in the Master Fund�s financial statements. Management�s  assessment considers tax years subject to investigation. The Master Fund  recognises interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognised tax  liability as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the  year ended 31 December 2015, the Master Fund did not incur any interest
or  penalties. 13

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 3. Cash and Cash equivalents and balances  with/and due to brokers At the year end amounts disclosed as cash and cash  equivalents, balances with brokers and balances due to brokers were held at  UBS Warburg Ltd. These include amounts transferred as collateral (which is  subject to a security interest) against open derivatives. To the extent that  the securities are purchased on margin, the margin debt may be secured on the  related securities. The portion of balances with brokers represented by  collateral at 31 December 2015 was US$21,768,386. Included in the cash and  cash equivalents balances at 31 December 2015 is cash in foreign currencies  with a fair value of US$(1,749,304) (cost US$(1,753,960)). 4. Fair value  measurements The Master Fund�s assets and liabilities carried at
fair value  have been categorised based upon the fair value hierarchy set out in note 2.  The following is a summary of the Master Fund�s financial instruments carried  at fair value as of 31 December 2015: Level 1 US$�Level 2 US$�Level 3 US$�Total US$�Derivatives Assets, at fair value Derivatives Bond futures  Commodity futures Index futures Forward currency contracts Total Derivatives  334,459 1,431,878 112,879 - - - - 11,583,198 - - - - 334,459 1,431,878  112,879 11,583,198 1,879,216 11,583,198 - 13,462,414 Total Derivatives  Assets, at fair value Derivatives Liabilities, at fair value Derivatives Bond  futures Commodity futures Index futures Interest rate futures Forward  currency contracts Total Derivatives 1,879,216 11,583,198 - 13,462,414  281,764 2,965,751 210,179 143,629 - - -

Investments  are reviewed at each financial reporting point to ensure that they are  correctly classified between level 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with the fair  value hierarchy outlined above. Where an investment�s characteristics change  during the year and investments no longer meet the criteria of a given level,  they are transferred into a more appropriate level at the end of relevant  financial reporting year. There were no transfers between levels during the  year ended 31 December 2015. 5. Derivatives Typically, derivative contracts  serve as components of the Master Fund�s investment strategy. The derivative  contracts
that the Master Fund is a party to are forward contracts and  futures contracts. As of 31 December 2015, the derivative contracts were  included in the Master Fund�s Statement of Financial Condition at fair value.  The Master Fund records its derivative activities on a mark-to-market basis.  Fair values are determined in accordance with the valuation principles set  out in note 2. For all OTC contracts, the Master Fund enters into master  netting agreements with its counterparties, which may allow in certain circumstances  netting of assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are only offset and  the net
amount reported in the Statement of Financial Condition when there is  a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an  intention to settle on a net basis or realise the assets and settle the  liabilities simultaneously. As at 31 December 2015 no assets or liabilities  are offset in the Statement of Financial Condition. As at 31 December 2015  all futures contracts were exchange traded and forward foreign currency  contracts were OTC contracts. As at 31 December 2015 master netting  arrangements were related to forward currency contracts held by the Master  Fund. The Master Fund
has not designated any derivative instruments as  hedging instruments under ASC 815 �Derivatives and hedging� (�ASC 815�). The  Condensed Schedule of Investments details information regarding derivative  types and their fair value at 31 December 2015. 14

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 5. Derivatives (continued) The effect of  transactions in derivative instruments on the Statement of Operations for the  year ended 31 December 2015 was as follows. Amount of gain or (loss)  recognised in Statement of Operations US$�Derivative Type Location of gain or  (loss) in Statement of Operations Futures contracts (non-commodity interest)  Futures contracts (commodity interest) Forward currency contracts Total Net  realised loss from non-commodity interest derivatives and foreign currency  (5,460,745) Net
realised gain from commodity interest derivatives Net  realised gain from non-commodity interest derivatives and foreign currency  8,795,010 6,581,479 9,915,744 Futures contracts (non-commodity interest)  Futures contracts (commodity interest) Forward currency contracts Net change  in unrealised depreciation on non-commodity interest derivatives and foreign  currency (2,413,587) Net change in unrealised depreciation on commodity  interest derivatives Net change in unrealised depreciation on non-commodity  interest derivatives and foreign currency (1,925,156) (1,987,668) Total  (6,326,411) The primary difference in the risk associated with OTC contracts  and
exchange-traded contracts is credit risk. The Master Fund has credit risk  from OTC contracts when two conditions are present (i) the OTC contracts have  unrealised gains, net of any collateral and (ii) the counterparty of the  contracts default. The credit risk related to exchange-traded contracts is  minimal because the exchange ensures that their contracts are always honoured  Futures are contracts
for delayed delivery of commodities, securities, equity  indices or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make  delivery at a specified future date of a specified commodity or instrument,  at a specified price or yield. Gains and losses on futures are recorded by  the Master Fund based upon market fluctuations and are recorded as realised  or unrealised gains or losses in the Statement of Operations. Forward  contracts entered into by the Master Fund represent a firm commitment to buy  or sell an underlying asset, or currency at a specified value and point in  time based upon an agreement or contracted quantity. The realised/unrealised  gain or loss is equal to the difference between the value of the contract at  the onset and the value of the contract
at settlement date/year-end date and  is included in the Statement of Operations. Derivative financial instruments  are generally based on notional amounts which are not recorded in the  financial statements. These notional amounts represent the theoretical  principal value on which the cash flows of the derivative transactions are  based. Unrealised gains or losses, rather than notional amounts, or the  exchange-traded derivatives traded by the Master Fund are included in the  Statement of Financial Condition. 17

Financial  risk management and associated risk Overall risk management The Master Fund�s  investment activities expose it to the various types of risk which are  associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.  The most important types of financial risks to which the Master Fund is  exposed are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Market risk includes  price
risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. The Master Fund manages  these risks on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with its  investing activities as part of its overall risk management policies. The  Master Fund has an agreement with FRM Investment Management (USA) LLC (up to  30 April 2015, FRM Investment Management Limited) to act as Risk Manager. The  Directors rely upon the Risk Manager to ensure that risks within the Master  Fund are adequately controlled by the Investment Manager. As a pre-requisite  for investment, initial due diligence is performed by the Risk Manager to  ensure that the Investment Manager has a sound trading strategy, a robust  operational infrastructure and a suitable risk management environment. The  Risk Manager then monitors the integrity of the Investment Manager�s  operations on an ongoing basis. The Risk Manager further monitors certain  risk and performance measures of the Master Fund on a regular basis to ensure  that
risks are effectively controlled and performance is in line with  expectations and in accordance with any investment restrictions placed upon  the Investment Manager. To this extent, the Risk Manager is given  transparency on the positions and performance of the Investment Manager. Such  measures include return breakouts, drawdowns, Value-at-Risk (�VaR�), risk  factor sensitivities and stress test losses. 18

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 7. Financial risk management and associated risk  (continued) Overall risk management (continued) The Risk Manager performs  regular reviews of certain performance based measures against the Master  Fund�s history of such measures and against that of the Investment Manager�s  comparator funds. If necessary the Risk Manager requests that corrective  action be taken. The nature and extent of the financial instruments  outstanding at the date of the Statement of Financial Condition and the risk  management policies employed by the Master Fund are discussed below. Market  risk Market risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of  financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such  as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Interest
rate  risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows  of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  interest rates. The Master Fund is exposed to interest rate risk on cash at  bank, balances with brokers, balances due to brokers and certain derivative  contracts. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future  cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in  foreign exchange rates. Although the majority of the Master Fund�s assets are  denominated in US$, the Master Fund may invest in securities and hold cash  balances at its brokers that are denominated in currencies other than its  reporting currency, the US$. Consequently, the Master Fund is exposed to  risks that the exchange rate of the US$�relative to other currencies may  change in a manner which has an adverse effect
on the reported value of that  portion of the Master Fund�s assets which are denominated in currencies other  than the US$. Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the price of  a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market conditions  influencing, directly or indirectly, the value of the financial instrument.  The Master Fund is exposed to other price risk from its financial  instruments. Due to the nature of the trading strategies followed by this  Master Fund, no direct relationship between any market factors and the  expected prices of the financial instruments can be reliably established.  Other price risk is managed through the overall risk management processes  described above. Credit/Counterparty risk Credit risk is the risk that an  issuer or counterparty will be unable to meet a commitment that it has  entered into with the Master Fund. The Master Fund's maximum exposure to  credit risk (not taking into account the value of any collateral
or other  security held) in the event that the counterparties fail to perform their  obligations as of 31 December 2015 in relation to each class of recognised  financial assets, other than derivatives, is the carrying amount of those  assets in the Statement of Financial Condition. With respect to derivative  financial instruments, credit risk arises from the potential failure of  counterparties to meet their obligations under the contract or arrangement.  The Risk Manager has centralised its due diligence and monitoring process of  the prime brokerage and trading relationships through a dedicated prime  brokerage and trading team utilized by an affiliated company. Credit and  counterparty risk is analysed by examining certain credit related criteria on  a centralised basis across platforms by establishing risk tolerance levels in  accordance with the overall risk profile of
the prime broker/counterparty as  determined by the Risk Manager. The credit quality of the Master Fund�s Bank,  Broker and any lenders at their parent companies level and subsidiaries when  they are available is regularly monitored and factored into allocation  decisions. The exposures are to HSBC Bank Plc (the �Bank�) and UBS Warburg  Ltd (the �Prime Broker�). As of the date of issuance of the financial  statements, according to Moody�s Rating Agency, the credit rating of HSBC  Bank Plc�s parent company, HSBC Holdings Plc, is A1 and the credit rating of  UBS Warburg Ltd�s parent company UBS AG, is BBB+ per S&P. In addition,  netting agreements and collateral arrangements (including International Swaps  and Derivatives Association Inc. (�ISDA�) Master Agreements for  over-the-counter derivatives) are routinely put in place when appropriate to  allow the
counterparty risk mitigating benefits of close-out netting and  payment netting (as applicable). 19

Campbell MAC  Cayman Fund Limited Notes to the financial statements (continued) For the  year ended 31 December 2015 7. Financial risk management and associated risk  (continued) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Master Fund  will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial  liabilities. Redeemable Participating Shareholder redemption requests are the  main liquidity risk for the Master Fund. The Master Fund�s Redeemable  Participating Shares are redeemable as outlined in note 10. The exposure to  liquidity risk through Redeemable Participating Shareholder redemption  requests is managed by specifically setting the redemption notice period to  accommodate the expected liquidity of the underlying investments as agreed by  the Investment Manager. The majority of the Master Fund�s financial  instruments are Level 1 financial instruments which are considered
readily  realisable as they are all listed on major recognised exchanges. The Master  Fund�s financial instruments also include investments in Level 2 financial  instruments, which are not quoted in an active public market and which  generally may be illiquid. As a result, the Master Fund may not be able to  liquidate quickly some of its investments in these instruments at an amount  close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements. 8.  Fees, commissions and other expenses Management and incentive fees Pursuant  to the Investment Management Agreement (the �IMA�), the Master Fund will pay  the Investment Manager (i) the Management Fee, payable monthly in arrears,  calculated daily, equal to 1/365 of the Applicable Management Fee Rate of the  Master Fund�s Adjusted Trading Level, adjusted for profits and losses. The  �Applicable Management Fee Rate� shall be (a) 1.50% where the Trading Level  is less than US$50 million; (b) 1.25% where
the Trading Level is equal to or  greater than US$50 million; (c) 1.00% where the Trading Level is equal to or  greater than US$100 million and (ii) the Incentive Fee, effective from 1  August 2015, payable on an annual basis in arrears, equal to the Applicable  Incentive Fee Rate of any net appreciation during the twelve-month period.  The �Applicable Incentive Fee Rate� shall be (a) 20% of any net appreciation  where the Trading Level is less than US$75 million; and (b) 15% of any net  appreciation where the Trading Level is equal to or greater than US$75  million; provided that no Incentive Fee shall be payable until losses in  previous periods have been recouped. Incentive Fees generally crystallise  upon a Redeemable Participating Shareholder making a redemption from the  Master Fund to the extent Incentive Fees are allocable at the time of the  redemption. In addition, redemptions generally reduce any then-allocable  losses that must be recouped by the Investment
Manager for it to be entitled  to Incentive Fees. Risk management fees Under the risk management agreement  up to 30 April 2015, FRM Investment Management Limited was responsible for  monitoring the trading and investments of the Investment Manager to ensure  compliance with the investment objectives and strategies of the Master Fund.  As compensation for its duties as Risk Manager, FRM Investment Management  Limited was paid risk management fees by the Master Fund equal to 0.5% per  annum of the Trading Level, as defined in the IMA, quarterly in arrears. From  1 May 2015, FRM Investment Management (USA) LLC provides the same services  but receives no separate remuneration from the Master Fund. Risk management  fees are paid by the Feeder Funds. Administration fees The Master Fund pays  the Administrator an administration fee of up to 0.135% per annum of the net  asset value of the Master Fund. 9. Related party transactions Master  Multi-Product Holdings II Ltd a Bermuda
incorporated company is a related  party through its 100% holding of all the Management Shares in the Master  Fund. Master Multi-Product Holdings II Ltd also shared a Director in common  with the Master Fund until 1 December 2015. The intermediate controlling  party of the Master Fund is therefore Master Multi-Product Holdings II Ltd.  FRM Investment Management (USA) LLC (up to 30 April 2015, FRM Investment  Management Limited) is a related party as it is the Risk Manager. FRM  Investment Management (USA) LLC is also the Commodity Pool Operator of the  Master Fund. FRM Investment Management Limited and FRM Investment Management  (USA) LLC are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Man Group plc and  therefore all subsidiaries of Man Group plc are also related parties.  Campbell & Company,
LP is a related party as it is the Investment Manager  of the Master Fund. On 1 May 2015, investors in the Master Fund transferred  their Redeemable Participating Shares in the Master Fund to the Offshore Fund  in consideration for Redeemable Participating Shares in the Offshore Fund.  This transaction had no impact on the value of the investors� capital. Each  of the Directors is or may become involved in other financial investment and  professional activities which may cause conflicts of interest with the  management of the Master Fund. These activities include management or  administration of other companies (including those with investment objectives  similar to those of the Master Fund or structures that may be related to Man  Group plc sponsored investment funds), purchases and sales of securities and  other investments, investment and management counselling and serving as  directors, advisers and/or agents of other companies, including companies and  legal structures
in which the Master Fund may invest and/or which may invest  into the Master Fund. 20

Capital management As a result of the  ability to issue and redeem Redeemable Participating Shares, the capital of  the Master Fund can vary depending on the demand for redemptions from and  subscriptions to the Master Fund. The Master Fund is not subject to  externally imposed capital requirements and has no restrictions on the issue  and redemption of Redeemable Participating Shares other than those set out in  the Feeder Funds� offering documents and Cayman Islands law.

An individual  Redeemable Participating Shareholder's financial highlights may vary from the  above based on the timing of capital transactions and individual management  and performance fee arrangements. The ratio details the total expenses less  trading costs (including interest rate, dividend costs and transaction and  brokerage costs) incurred by the Master Fund in the course of normal trading,  to the average net assets described above. (ii) 12.Indemnifications In the  normal course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts that contain  a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general  indemnifications. The Master Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements  is unknown, as this would involve future claims
that may be made against the  Master Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience,  management expects the risk of loss to be remote. 13.Subsequent events Ronan  Daly resigned as a director of the Master Fund on 7 January 2016. Colin Ball  and John Renouf were appointed as directors of the Master Fund on 7 January  2016. Subsequent to 31 December 2015, Redeemable Participating Shareholders  subscribed for Redeemable Participating Shares having an aggregate Net Asset  Value of US$5,175,000 and redeemed Redeemable Participating Shares having an  aggregate Net Asset Value of US$20,600,093. In connection with the  preparation of the financial statements as of 31 December 2015, management  has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Master Fund through  17 March 2016, the date the financial statements were available to be issued,  and has determined that there were no additional subsequent events requiring  recognition or disclosure in the financial
statements. . 22

This report is made solely to the directors,  as a body. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the  directors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors�  report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent

An audit  involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the disclosures  in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on judgment,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of amounts and  the auditors� the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control  relevant to the entity�s preparation and fair presentation of the financial  statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the entity�s internal control. An audit also includes  evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe  that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the  accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all  material respects, the financial position of Campbell MAC Cayman Fund Limited  at 31 December 2015, and the results of its operations and changes in its net  assets for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles. 17 March 2016 24 A member firm of Ernst & Young  Global Limited

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.

The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
