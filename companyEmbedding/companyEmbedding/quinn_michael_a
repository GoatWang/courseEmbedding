Michael J. Quinn
MICHAEL J. QUINN, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CardioGenesis
Corporation, is an experienced senior executive with a strong marketing,
sales and operations background. He was hired by the Board in October
2000 to stem the company’s losses and set it on a course that would lead
to growth, profitability and enhanced shareholder value. Mr. Quinn and
his new management team have completely reshaped the company. Under his
leadership, the domestic and international marketing and sales
organizations have been rebuilt and revitalized, operating costs have
been slashed, the downward slide in revenue has been reversed, losses
have narrowed, the market’s acceptance of the company’s principal
products has been increased and a plan to expand the product focus of
CardioGenesis has been implemented. From 1976 to 2000, Mr. Quinn held a
number of senior level executive management positions including Chief
Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer at several
major healthcare companies including American Hospital Supply
Corporation (V. Mueller and Scientific Products Divisions), Picker
International, Cardinal Health, Bergen Brunswig and Fisher Scientific,
all large cap public corporations.  For the first time in four years,
CardioGenesis will introduce new innovative technology, which will
enable the company to expand its revenue base and begin to build on its
strong angiogenic product platform.

Title: Owner
               Company: All J Products
Job Details
               Company Size: Less than $1 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. All J Products is a family owned business. Together, we have over 40 years of combined experience in four-wheeling, and our staff has immense experience building Jeep vehicles. Our specialty is designing and fabricating Jeep aftermarket parts and body armor that are made to be functional as well as good looking. Additionally, we have over 20 years of experience in the national automotive industry, over 30 years experience in various engineering fields, and over five years experience in the steel industry. We are an authorized professional suspension system installation de aler for various lift kit manufacturers, including Nth Degree Mobility, Rubicon Express, Full Traction, Daystar, SuperLift and other well-known lift kits. We modify Jeeps and perform scheduled maintenance for your Jeep, stock, modified, or whatever - we're here for you and YOUR Jeep! At All J Products our goal is to provide our customers with the best service and the best products. It doesn't matter if you are a hard-core wheeler, if you enjoy scenic trail riding with your family, or just want to explore the mountains or deserts, we can help set up your vehicle the way you need it for the way you use it. We know that not everyone needs a hard core trail rig, most of us have to drive our rigs to work everyday. Whichever way you want your vehicle set up, we can do it. Our current personal collection of Jeeps includes a HEMI Powered 2007 Unlimited 4-door JK Wrangler, a 97 4.0L TJ Wrangler , a V8 Vortec powered CJ8 Scambler, and a 93 higly modified Grand Cherokee! In the past we've also owned XJ Cherokees, CJ7's and CJ5s, an M715 1968 Jeep truck, A V8 powered Jeepster Commando and flat fenders. Every one here at All J Products owns at least one Jeep. We participate in many four-wheeling events and local club activities. We are also very active members of our local 4X4 club, the Bear Valley 4x4 Club. All J Products is also proud to be an Associate Member of CORVA. All of our Boulder Bars (rocker panel protection) and Bumpers are made in vehicle-specific welding fixtures to ensure the highest quality and fit. All J Product's Boulder Bars are made with heavy-duty 2"x 2" x 3/16" OR 2"x3" x 3/16" thick box tubing. All J Product's Bumpers are made of heavy-duty 2"x 5" x 3/16" thick box tubing. Another great feature found on our Boulder Bars and Bumpers is that all ends are capped and welded. After each part is assembled and welded, a full inspection and cleaning is done. Then the Boulder Bars and Bumpers are sand blasted before getting powder coated with a thick Satin Black finish. All of our products are built to provide the strongest body protection available, while providing the least amount of loss in ground clearance and a great look. Before our products are released to you, our customer, we fully test the prototypes on our own Jeeps, as well as other Jeeps in our local clubs. Testing is done on the trail, with real life situations, in locations such as: The Rubicon Trail, California; Moab, Utah; Big Bear, California; Johnson Valley's Hammers, CA, and many other local California hot spots in the rocks. We test all of the products we sell, and we have owned a lot of Jeep vehicles, so we know what works and what doesn't. We are only satisfied when our customers are happy. Our best sales people are our customers who use and recommend our products and services to others. --To our customers: Thank you for your support! We wouldn't be the company we are today with out you.

Our team




Michael Quinn
Senior Stylist, Salon Owner






Michael Quinn claims he fell into hairdressing by accident, but some might say it could only be fate. While always interested in hair and fashion, Michael didn't consider it as a profession until he was asked by a friend to model in a hairdressing competition. At the show he couldn't resist styling the mannequin hair and so impressed one of the teachers that he was offered a place on a course...and as they say, the rest is history.

Joico Academy




 
 
Celebrated hair stylist Michael Quinn has been 												appointed as the first Educator for hair company JOICO in 												Northern Ireland. The JOICO brand, which includes a 												selection of products for cleaning, styling and preserving 												colour in hair, is now used throughout the world by 												professional hair stylists following, its origin in LA in 												1975. The successful hairdresser Steve Stefano who quickly 												expanded the brand from one salon to a chain of 34 across 												Southern California was not only a stylist, but also had an 												intrinsic understanding of the science involved to maintain 												healthy, beautiful hair and this key aspect is embedded in 												all JOICO products today.

Michael’s role as JOICO Educator means that he will 												deliver training seminars to salon students with an aim to 												develop JOICO stylists and colourists. Michael noted the 												benefits of the JOICO education programme for Ireland 												saying, “with Michael Quinn Hairdressing taking on the role 												of JOICO Academy it enhances the opportunity for training 												locally”. Students previously would have had to travel to 												Dublin or Athlone, whereas a local academy in Belfast makes 												education much more accessible. 
 

He added; “One of JOICO’s key strengths as a company 												is commitment to on-going education and development.” And 												with Michael fresh from training at JOICO’s Artistic 												Institute in Helmond, The Netherlands, he is well up-to-date 												with the latest techniques and innovations in cut and 												colour. 
 

Michael and his team will be putting these skills into 												practice in 2013 with various courses planned including 												JOICO cut and colour courses and a focus on trend 												collections.
