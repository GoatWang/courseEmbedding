Financial Advisor



856-810-7701










Catherine earned the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM Practitioner designation over 10 years ago to help ensure she is always prepared to educate and empower clients who are taking on a stronger leadership role in their lives.That empowerment begins by helping clients understand the overall role finances play in their lives, not just within their investments. Catherine serves clients, many of whom are women growing or reclaiming their independence from a divorce or loss, and require much more than a snapshot view of their financial picture. These clients realize their financial health is an evolving process, one that needs continuing review and refinement. It is Catherine's passion and goal to change the conversation about personal finance for women and help them experience lasting financial freedom.For more than 30 years Catherine has  worked in the financial profession, developing and implementing comprehensive financial plans for individuals, many of whom also own small businesses.She joined M Financial Planning Services in 2010, having previously served as senior financial planning consultant at Fidelity Investments, vice president of Renaissance Wealth Management Group, vice president at Wachovia Securities and a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch.In 2014 Catherine was awarded The Women's Choice Award for Financial Advisors, which was created by WomenCertified® in partnership with WIFE.org  to identify advisors that women can trust.1Catherine is the president of South Jersey Women in Business and a committee member for Habitat for Humanity. Her other charities include CASA, Camden County Women's Center, and Operation Yellow Ribbon. Catherine is also a member of NAWBO, the Society of Financial Service Professionals, the Estate and Financial Planning Council of Southern New Jersey, the National Association of Professional Women and the Financial Planning Association, local and national chapters. The Women's Choice Award® by WomenCertified Inc. is a recognition award for advisors who provide quality service to their female clients. The Award is based on 17 objective criteria associated with providing quality service to women clients such as credentials, experience and a favorable regulatory history. Financial advisors may have paid a basic program fee to cover the cost of comprehensive review and client survey.

As a big time lover of unique textiles and in particular knitwear, when I first encountered French designer Catherine Andre and her knitwear collection a number of years ago, I was blown away. Each piece is made with the extraordinary skill and with the vision of an artist and each collection has a fresh and unique feel to it. Her coats, dresses, sweaters, scarves, shawls, skirts, gloves and socks are beautiful works of art. And as beautifully as they photograph on our web-site, they need to be seen in person to be fully appreciated.
