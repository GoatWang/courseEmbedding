Richard Belluzzo
BS 75, LHD 04
US Venture Partner at INNOGEST SGR SpA 

                              
                                 Leading with a Hard Head & a Soft Heart
                              
                           





Rick Belluzzo is a managing director at Corso Partners. He was previously the CEO
                              and Chair of Quantum Corp., the 30-year-old electronic records storage company located
                              in San Jose, California, whose products store a trove of corporate data. The company
                              sold its hard drive business in 2001 and Rick came aboard in 2002 charged with turning
                              around Quantum and reinventing the stalwart storage company and former hard drive
                              supplier into a storage systems company -- a tall order in today's highly competitive
                              information technology market.
                           
Going to college was not a tradition in his family; Rick was the first and only family
                              member who graduated.
                           
Of his experience at GGU, Rick says, "In some ways I was typical of what GGU stood
                              for. I attended Santa Rosa Junior College and had to pay my own way. The tuition was
                              $11 per semester! I came to GGU because I had to work while finishing my degree. I
                              took day classes and some night classes and was hired as an intern at Hood & Strong.
                              It was a focused life. I took the bus back and forth and had classes in the morning,
                              in the afternoon, and I worked in the financial district and studied on the bus. It
                              took me 4 years and one additional semester to complete my degree."
                           
It is clear that Rick credits his experience at Hewlett Packard with sculpting his
                              professional personality and honing his leadership skills. He started with HP in their
                              Santa Rosa office, before moving to Boise, Idaho, where he spent most of his effort
                              establishing the companys laser printer and imaging divisions. After 22 years of success,
                              Rick was confronted with the decision to try to become the CEO of HP or to try something
                              different. After some thought, Belluzzo resigned from Hewlett Packard in 1998, and
                              left Boise, Idaho, to become President and CEO of Silicon Graphics Inc. in Redwood
                              City, California, a high-end graphics computer manufacturer which at its peak boasted
                              annual sales of $4 billion and employed 10,000 people.
                           
After two years at SGI, Rick left after putting in a great deal of effort to salvage
                              the business whose products were being eclipsed by the desktop PC. However, shortly
                              after leaving SGI, Belluzzo was hired to head up Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce
                              Group, which included MSN Internet services, the XBox video game and a series of other
                              consumer-oriented businesses. In February 2001, he assumed the role of President and
                              COO, where he would remain until a major restructuring in April 2002.
                           
After leaving Microsoft, Belluzzo was enlightened by Barry Diller, the highly-regarded
                              CEO and Chair of IAC. IAC operates leading and diversified businesses in sectors being
                              transformed by the Internet, including Expedia, Ticketmaster, Lending Tree, RealEstate.com,
                              Match.com, Citysearch, and Evite. Diller spoke persuasively about the evolution of
                              the Internet in the technology industry and the need for leaders with Rick's skills
                              to help troubled companies through transformation. Rick was inspired to look at the
                              opportunity to run Quantum Corp.
                           
Thinking back on his education, Rick remembers Golden Gate University fondly: "GGU
                              was a perfect fit for me. It is a special place. I enjoyed my time there. GGU's mission
                              to offer practical education to working adults is worth more today than ever. GGU
                              continues to serve a real purpose in the needs of working people, just as it did for
                              me. In the past, you went to college and then to work for one company, where you stayed
                              and worked, and that tended to be what you did for the remainder of your career. Now,
                              thats not good enough. We have to think about reinventing ourselves during our careers,
                              and having a formal academic process to support that changeover is essential."

Microsoft president and COO Belluzzo resigns
Some suspect corporate culture is to blame for his unexpected departure after 14 months

Microsoft president and COO Belluzzo resigns

1 / 1


Back to Gallery
















Fourteen months after being named president and chief operating officer at Microsoft Corp., Richard Belluzzo is leaving the software company, he said last night.
The unexpected resignation prompted speculation that Microsoft's corporate culture, dominated for more than 20 years by Chairman Bill Gates and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, can be difficult for outside executives to penetrate.



"It is an exceptional person who can come in and make it there from the outside," said John Coutts, an executive recruiter at Korn/Ferry International. "Microsoft is very results-oriented and moves very quickly. It is almost like baptism by fire." 
Belluzzo, the former chief executive at Silicon Graphics Inc. and a longtime Hewlett-Packard Co. executive, admits that it was difficult to fit in at first. 
"Good companies have strong cultures," Belluzzo said in an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "I think over the last number of months, ironically, I felt like I made a transition and learned the aspects of the company and how to operate (within it) and what is unique about the culture. I don't think that is the issue." 



Latest business videos




 
Microsoft has no plans to replace Belluzzo, 48, who said the decision to leave the company was made after private discussions with Ballmer about the structure of the organization.
As part of those discussions, Ballmer and Belluzzo decided to give more control and financial responsibility to individual business unit leaders. Under that structure, Belluzzo said his responsibilities would be diminished.
"Being the person in the middle to help make the pieces work together was not going to be an important role over time," he said. "That was becoming increasingly clear over the last couple of months and it culminated in us making the decision that I don't want to be in a role that is not vital and not essential."
In a news release issued yesterday afternoon, Ballmer said Microsoft will miss Belluzzo's leadership and experience. Ballmer also emphasized the new corporate structure, saying it would give deeper control of the individual business units to the managers that run them.
Belluzzo, who joined Microsoft in September 1999 and was promoted to the senior leadership team in last February 2001, said he would like to stay in Seattle, where he now lives with his new wife. Belluzzo also wants to lead another company, though he said, "I don't know where it is or what it is or anything like that." For the next five months, he will work with Microsoft during a transition period.
Belluzzo's resignation caught many analysts by surprise, though several said shakeups among Microsoft's senior management are becoming commonplace. 
"They do have the reorganization du jour thing going on over there," said Jonathan Geurkink, an analyst at Ragen McKenzie. "But I have to say, I was surprised that he was leaving. I didn't see that coming."
Scott McAdams, president of Seattle-based investment firm McAdams Wright Ragen Inc. and a longtime Microsoft watcher, agreed that management structure shakeups aren't unusual for Microsoft. 
"This company is fairly notorious for doing this," he said.
While Belluzzo was someone Ballmer hand-picked, his departure signals that "obviously Bill and Steve are not real happy with the way things are going, and he's taking the heat, whether it's his fault or not."
McAdams said Gates and Ballmer may be frustrated with Microsoft's efforts to break into new markets, including television set-top boxes or smart phones.
"They look at the money spent on R&D (research and development) and they look at how they're doing, and they say, 'We should be doing better than that,'" McAdams said. "I don't think Rick is to blame, but he's the fall guy."
Under its new structure "it sounds like Steve will roll up his sleeves and do it himself."
"At the end of the day, it's still the Bill and Steve show," McAdams said. "They expect a lot. They're driven guys."
The news of Belluzzo's departure and Microsoft's reorganization comes a day after Goldman Sachs & Co. issued a report saying that the company will earn less than forecast in its next fiscal year. The stock fell $2.93 Tuesday and 97 cents yesterday. It closed yesterday at $56.33. In after-hours trading, the stock rose as much as 37 cents, closing at $56.70.
Microsoft stock could fall a little bit as possible concerns arise about what is going on with management, Geurkink said.
During his short tenure at Microsoft, Belluzzo was responsible for developing marketing, sales and business development relationships and overseeing high-profile consumer projects such as the MSN Internet service and Xbox game console.
He also made contributions to Microsoft's heavily touted .NET strategy.
Belluzzo said he was most proud of focusing the strategy behind Microsoft's consumer products, helping with the current internal "business transformation" and creating "the softer-side relationships" with employees, partners and customers. 
"He came in and he helped do a lot of work on the MSN side and got that organization whipped into shape," Geurkink said. 
Like his predecessor Bob Herbold, Belluzzo -- who spent 23 years at Hewlett-Packard -- brought an outsider's perspective to Microsoft, Guerkink said. 
With 48,958 employees and revenue topping $25 billion, Guerkink said Microsoft needs that outside influence.
"I think Microsoft wants to think of itself as a nimble company that can move very quickly," he said. 
"It is really unusual in technology to have the original entrepreneur or founder carry the company through to this size and stature in the industry. 
"Often they are bringing in professional managers. Overall, it was a bit of a surprise to me."

Richard Belluzzo - Wikipedia





















 






Richard Belluzzo

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Richard Belluzzo (often known as Rick Belluzzo) (born November 26, 1953) is an American businessman who worked as an executive at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Silicon Graphics (SGI), and Microsoft before becoming CEO of Quantum Corp. in September 2002.[1] He held this position until April 2011, when he became the executive chairman until August 2012.[citation needed] He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Golden Gate University.
Belluzzo worked for HP for 23 years, with his last role being executive vice president of their computer division.[2] He moved to SGI in January 1998, becoming Chairman of the Board and CEO,[3] succeeding Edward R. McCracken.[4] In August 1999, Belluzzo left SGI to head Microsoft's MSN division. He became president and chief operating officer of Microsoft for fourteen months, but left in spring 2002,[5][6] moving to Quantum in September the same year.
Much of his career is clouded in controversy and many consider him to be responsible for the demise of SGI.[5][7][8][9] He was a strong advocate at HP to reduce their investments in HP-UX and PA-RISC in favor of Windows NT and Itanium, as well as getting SGI to cut their investments in IRIX and MIPS. The effect of these decisions was to destroy two of the leading platforms in Unix computing and greatly increased the opportunity for Intel and Microsoft to get into high-end computing.
