Advaxis Appoints World Renowned Oncologist and Research Scientist, Dr. Samir N. Khleif, to Its Board of Directors


 Download as PDF

October 08, 2014

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 8, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advaxis, Inc. (Nasdaq:ADXS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer immunotherapies, announced the appointment of world renowned oncologist and research scientist, Dr. Samir N. Khleif, to the Company's Board of Directors. Dr. Khleif has more than 20 years of experience in the medical oncology, tumor immunology and immunotherapy fields.

 "We are delighted to welcome Dr. Khleif to Advaxis's Board of Directors," commented Daniel J. O'Connor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advaxis. "Dr. Khleif's in-depth knowledge of immunotherapy products generally, as well as of our proprietary Lm-LLO cancer immunotherapy technology specifically, will be of great value to Advaxis. We look forward to benefiting from his guidance as we work diligently to advance our Lm-LLO cancer immunotherapies to create shareholder value."

 Dr. Khleif currently serves as the Director of the State of Georgia Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University Cancer Center and the Cancer Service Line. Dr. Khleif was formerly Chief of the Cancer Vaccine Section at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and also served as a Special Assistant to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) leading the Critical Path Initiative for oncology. Dr. Khleif is a Georgia Research Alliance Distinguished Cancer Scientist and Clinician and holds a professorship in Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Graduate Studies at Georgia Regents University.

 Dr. Khleif's research program at Georgia Regents University Cancer Center focuses on understanding the mechanisms of cancer-induced immune suppression, and utilizing this knowledge for the development of novel immune therapeutics and vaccines against cancer. His research group designed and performed some of the first cancer vaccine clinical trials targeting specific genetic changes in cancer cells. He led many national efforts and committees on the development of biomarkers and integration of biomarkers in clinical trials, including the AACR-NCI-FDA Cancer Biomarker Collaborative and the ASCO Alternative Clinical Trial Design. Dr. Khleif is the author of many book chapters and scientific articles on tumor immunology and biomarkers process development, and he is the editor for two textbooks on cancer therapeutics, tumor immunology, and cancer vaccines.

 Dr. Khleif was inducted into the American Society for Clinical Investigation, received the National Cancer Institute's Director Golden Star Award, the National Institutes of Health Award for Merit, the Commendation Medal of the US Public Health Service, and he was recently appointed to the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Forum.

 "Samir's extensive experience with both the science and business of oncology makes him an ideal addition to the Board of Directors of Advaxis," commented James Patton, Chairman of Advaxis. "His guidance and high standards will be invaluable in the advancement of Advaxis's technology to registrational trials and beyond."

About Advaxis, Inc.

 Advaxis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing multiple cancer immunotherapies based on its proprietary platform intended to redirect the immune system to kill cancer. The Advaxis Lm-LLO technology, using bioengineered live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, is the only known cancer immunotherapy agent shown in preclinical studies to both generate cancer fighting T-cells directed against a cancer antigen and neutralize Tregs and MSDCs, that protect the tumor microenvironment from immunologic attack and contribute to tumor growth. Advaxis's lead immunotherapy, ADXS-HPV, targets human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and is in clinical trials for three indications: Phase 2 in invasive cervical cancer, Phase 1/2 in head and neck cancer, and Phase 1/2 in anal cancer. The FDA has granted Advaxis orphan drug designation for each of these three indications. The Company plans to initiate a registration clinical program for cervical cancer in 2015 and has established licensing partners in India and Asia for commercialization in those regions. Advaxis is planning to evaluate the combination of ADXS-HPV with an anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in HPV-associated cervical cancer and head and neck cancer.

 Advaxis's second Lm-LLO immunotherapy candidate in clinical testing will be ADXS-PSA, which is being developed to address prostate cancer. Advaxis is planning to file an IND with the FDA and initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical study with ADXS-PSA alone and in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. Advaxis is also developing Lm-LLO immunotherapy ADXS-cHER2, to target the Her2 receptor overexpressing cancers. Her2 is overexpressed in certain solid-tumor cancers, including pediatric bone cancer (or osteosarcoma), breast cancer, esophageal, and gastric cancer. Advaxis is developing ADXS-cHER2 for both human and animal-health, and has seen promising results in canine osteosarcoma, which is considered a model for human osteosarcoma. Advaxis is planning to file an IND for ADXS-cHER2 in Her2 overexpressing cancers and to conduct a clinical program in pediatric osteosarcoma. Advaxis has licensed ADXS-cHER2 and three other immunotherapy constructs to Aratana Therapeutics, Inc.

The aim of palliative care as outlined by the WHO is to enhance the quality of life for both patients and their families. Palliative Care Nursing in Jordan[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Palliative care is progressively more existing and the importance of its role is increasingly acknowledged by many countries. This paper identifies and examines main stepladders taken by Jordan for the development of palliative care. In palliative care, the primary goal is alleviating symptom distress resulting from multiple symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients and their families. To meet patients' multiple needs, it is generally believed that the care should be holistic, multidisciplinary, and patient as well as family centred. Countries should develop and implement educational programs for multidisciplinary healthcare providers so as to be able to enhance the quality of care provided to patients and families at all levels of care. Unfortunately, in Jordan, skill development among health care providers; few educational and training opportunities exist to this point; and specialty acknowledgement also has not yet occurred. Research capacity is also inadequate. Policy to develop, improve, and sustain palliative care is also lacking in Jordan. Palliative care in Jordan is evolving but has far to go. Adequate resources provision, educational programs, credentialed healthcare providers are crucial elements that palliative care in Jordan needs.

Moreover, several clinical studies have tested mutated epitopes or individually expressed mutations as vaccine targets [76][77][78]and demonstrated that mutated epitopes could elicit immune responses in the immunized patients [79] and could act as tumor-rejection antigens in mouse tumor models [80]. In the case of advanced melanoma, it has been shown that the induction of a poly-epitopic tumor-specific immune responses by autologous patient-specific vaccines correlated with complete remissions [81]. Whole Tumor Antigen Vaccines: Where Are We?[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: With its vast amount of uncharacterized and characterized T cell epitopes available for activating CD4⁺ T helper and CD8⁺ cytotoxic lymphocytes simultaneously, whole tumor antigen represents an attractive alternative source of antigens as compared to tumor-derived peptides and full-length recombinant tumor proteins for dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. Unlike defined tumor-derived peptides and proteins, whole tumor lysate therapy is applicable to all patients regardless of their HLA type. DCs are essentially the master regulators of immune response, and are the most potent antigen-presenting cell population for priming and activating naïve T cells to target tumors. Because of these unique properties, numerous DC-based immunotherapies have been initiated in the clinics. In this review, we describe the different types of whole tumor antigens that we could use to pulse DCs ex vivo and in vivo. We also discuss the different routes of delivering whole tumor antigens to DCs in vivo and activating them with toll-like receptor agonists. Full-text · Article · Jun 2015 Cheryl Lai-Lai ChiangGeorge CoukosLana E KandalaftRead full-textAnother rational approach would be to combine PD-1 pathway blockade with a vaccination strategy, because vaccines have been shown to be able to recruit immune effector cells into the tumor microenvironment [72] . In a similar framework, it has been suggested to use specific T cells targeting, for example, IDO or PD-L1, to target immune suppression [38,73]. The boosting of such T cells could directly modulate immune regulation and alter tumor tolerance . Reorienting the immune system in the treatment of cancer by using anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Physiologically, the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway is involved in limiting the killing of bystander cells during an infection and controlling autoimmunity. However, cancers exploit this system to avoid immune killing, and PD-1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) expression on tumor cells, as well as PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, have shown to be negative prognostic factors. Promising clinical results have been obtained by PD-1 pathway blockade in a range of cancers while still maintaining a manageable toxicity profile, and two anti-PD-1 antibodies are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. As already shown with nivolumab and ipilimumab, the combination of PD-1 pathway blockade with other anticancer agents holds promise in the form of additive synergistic anticancer effects.

AndersenInge Marie SvaneInge Marie SvaneReadPatients with advanced solid tumors bearing Ras mutations were given a cancer vaccine comprised of autologous peptides along with IL-2, GMCSF, or both. Although most patients developed antigenspecific immune responses, only one patient out of 57 generated productive immunity that went on to eliminate the tumor cells[53]. This disparity led to the discovery that regulatory T cell (Tregs) are significantly expanded in colon cancer patients with mutated Ras compared to both healthy individuals and colon cancer patients with wildtype Ras. Immunotherapy biomarkers 2016: Overcoming the barriers[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This report summarizes the symposium, ‘Immunotherapy Biomarkers 2016: Overcoming the Barriers’, which was held on April 1, 2016 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The symposium, cosponsored by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), focused on emerging immunotherapy biomarkers, new technologies, current hurdles to further progress, and recommendations for advancing the field of biomarker development.

We and others have shown that vaccinating patients with mutant ras peptides could elicit specific immune responses against the corresponding antigens11121314. In a previously reported phase I clinical trial, we demonstrated the safety of vaccinating advanced cancer patients with the corresponding mutated ras pep- tides [12] . The immunological and clinical effects of mutated ras peptide vaccine in combination with IL-2, GM-CSF, or both in patients with solid tumors[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Mutant Ras oncogenes produce proteins that are unique to cancer cells and represent attractive targets for vaccine therapy. We have shown previously that vaccinating cancer patients with mutant ras peptides is feasible and capable of inducing a specific immune response against the relevant mutant proteins. Here, we tested the mutant ras peptide vaccine administered in combination with low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) or/and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in order to enhance the vaccine immune response.
5000mug of the corresponding mutant ras peptide was given subcutaneously (SQ) along with IL-2 (Arm A), GM-CSF (Arm B) or both (Arm C). IL-2 was given SQ at 6.0 million IU/m2/day starting at day 5, 5 days/week for 2 weeks. GM-CSF was given SQ in a dose of 100mug/day one day prior to each ras peptide vaccination for 4 days. Vaccines were repeated every 5 weeks on arm A and C, and every 4 weeks on arm B, for a maximum of 15 cycles or until disease progression.
We treated 53 advanced cancer patients (38 with colorectal, 11 with pancreatic, 1 with common bile duct and 3 with lung) on 3 different arms (16 on arm A, 18 on arm B, and 19 on arm C). The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.6 and 16.9 months, respectively, for all patients evaluable for clinical response (n = 48). There was no difference in PFS or OS between the three arms (P = 0.73 and 0.99, respectively). Most adverse events were grade 1-2 toxicities and resolved spontaneously. The vaccine induced an immune response to the relevant ras peptide in a total of 20 out of 37 evaluable patients (54%) by ELISPOT, proliferative assay, or both. While 92.3% of patients on arm B had a positive immune response, only 31% of patients on arm A and 36% of patients on arm C had positive immune responses (P = 0.003, Fisher's exact test).
The reported data showed that IL-2 might have a negative effect on the specific immune response induced by the relevant mutant ras vaccine in patients with advanced cancer. This observation deserves further investigations. Trial registration: NCI97C0141. Full-text · Article · Feb 2014 Osama E RahmaJ. Michael HamiltonMalgorzata Wojtowicz+1 more author...Omar DakheelRead full-textYao et al. and Strauss and Simon used a sequential approach to screen treatments by a series of single-arm[15,16]or twoarm[14]trials over a time domain. These approaches have some limitations, such as requiring intensive resources and the uncertainty of prior distribution of response rate[13]. Rubinstein et al. considered a standard randomized twoarm design with a large type I and II error[9]. A Bayesian pick-the-winner design in a randomized phase II clinical trial[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Purpose: 
Many phase II clinical trials evaluate unique experimental drugs/combinations through multi-arm design to expedite the screening process (early termination of ineffective drugs) and to identify the most effective drug (pick the winner) to warrant a phase III trial. Various statistical approaches have been developed for the pick-the-winner design but have been criticized for lack of objective comparison among the drug agents.

Methods: 
We developed a Bayesian pick-the-winner design by integrating a Bayesian posterior probability with Simon two-stage design in a randomized two-arm clinical trial. The Bayesian posterior probability, as the rule to pick the winner, is defined as probability of the response rate in one arm higher than in the other arm. The posterior probability aims to determine the winner when both arms pass the second stage of the Simon two-stage design.

Results: 
When both arms are competitive (i.e., both passing the second stage), the Bayesian posterior probability performs better to correctly identify the winner compared with the Fisher exact test in the simulation study. In comparison to a standard two-arm randomized design, the Bayesian pick-the-winner design has a higher power to determine a clear winner. In application to two studies, the approach is able to perform statistical comparison of two treatment arms and provides a winner probability (Bayesian posterior probability) to statistically justify the winning arm.

Conclusion: 
We developed an integrated design that utilizes Bayesian posterior probability, Simon two-stage design, and randomization into a unique setting. It gives objective comparisons between the arms to determine the winner.Article · Nov 2015 Dung-Tsa ChenPo-Yu HuangHui-Yi Lin+1 more author...Alberto A.

To further verify the prognostic significance of TIM-3 in cancer patients and its correlation with tumor, we performed this meta-analysis including seven studies searched from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase till July 2016. A total of 869 patients were used to analyze the association between TIM-3 expression and patients' overall survival (OS). The pooled results showed that higher expression of TIM-3 was significantly correlated to shorter OS (7 studies, HR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.38-2.57; P< 0.001). In addition, higher TIM-3 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage (3 studies, III/IV vs. I/II, RR=2.02; 95% CI: 1.45-2.81; P< 0.001). In conclusion, our study highlights the role of TIM-3 as a potential prognostic marker and a promising therapeutic target in solid tumors.

We selected TC-1[20]syngeneic mouse model which is a Treg-dependent tumor model[22], and the frequency of Tregs increases significantly in tumor bearing mice compared to non-tumor mice (Figure 2B). In addition, TC-1 expresses PI3Kα and PI3Kβ, but do not express detectable levels of p110δ (Figure 2C). Differential PI3Kδ signaling in CD4+ T cell subsets enables selective targeting of T regulatory cells to enhance cancer immunotherapy[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: To modulate T cell function for cancer therapy one challenge is to selectively attenuate regulatory but not conventional CD4+ T cell subsets (Treg and Tconv). In this study we show how a functional dichotomy in Class IA PI3K isoforms in these two subsets of CD4+ T cells be exploited to target Treg while leaving Tconv intact. Studies employing isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors and a PI3Kδ-deficient mouse strain revealed that PI3Kα and PI3Kβ were functionally redundant with PI3Kδ in Tconv. Conversely, PI3Kδ was functionally critical in Treg, acting there to control TCR signaling, cell proliferation and survival. Notably, in a murine model of lung cancer, co-administration of a PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor with a tumor-specific vaccine decreased numbers of suppressive Treg and increased numbers of vaccine-induced CD8 T-cells within the tumor microenvironment, eliciting potent anti-tumor efficacy. Overall, our results offer a mechanistic rationale to employ PI3Kδ inhibitors to selectively target Treg and improve cancer immunotherapy.

A high level of p16INK4A gene expression in HPV positive cells was originally considered to be a consequence of transcription activation by E2F transcription factor [172]. However, subsequent studies provided pieces of evidences demonstrating that the p16INK4A overexpression caused by HPV16 E7-mediated KDM6B upregulation represents an E7- triggered oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) response [32,170]. Human papillomaviruses in epigenetic regulations[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses, that infect epithelial cells and are etiologically involved in the development of human cancer. Today, over 200 types of human papillomaviruses are known. They are divided into low-risk and high-risk HPVs depending on their potential to induce carcinogenesis, driven by two major viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7. By interacting with cellular partners, these proteins are involved in interdependent viral and cell cycles in stratified differentiating epithelium, and concomitantly induce epigenetic changes in infected cells and those undergoing malignant transformation. E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with and/or modulate expression of many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including DNA methyltransferases, histone-modifying enzymes and subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes, thereby influencing host cell transcription program. Furthermore, HPV oncoproteins modulate expression of cellular micro RNAs. Most of these epigenetic actions in a complex dynamic interplay participate in the maintenance of persistent infection, cell transformation, and development of invasive cancer by a considerable deregulation of tumor suppressor and oncogenes. In this study, we have undertaken to discuss a number of studies concerning epigenetic regulations in HPV-dependent cells and to focus on those that have biological relevance to cancer progression. Full-text · Article · May 2017 Julia DurzyńskaKrzysztof LesniewiczElzbieta PorebaRead full-textSince the T cell profile of an individual has not been resolved and because independent experiments often use different metrics to analyze how the immune system is engaging in CAR T cell therapy in general, there have been calls to have a more uniform manner in the accumulation of data. For example, Klaver et al. suggest that there should be a minimum amount of immunologic testing throughout CAR T-cell administration congruent to the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, US FDA, and NCI Taskforce for the development of biomarkers in immune therapy trials [39,40]. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for malignant cancers: Summary and perspective[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This paper will summarize the data obtained primarily from the last decade of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy. It will do so in a manner that provides an overview needed to set the foundation for perspective on the state of research associated with CAR T cell therapy. The topics covered will include the construction of engineered CAR T cells from the standpoint of the different generations, the mode in which autologous T cells are transfected, the various biomarkers that have been used in CAR T cell immunotherapy, and setbacks associated with engineered T cells. Perspective on priorities of CAR T cell immunotherapy will also be addressed as they are related to safety and efficacy. Full-text · Article · Aug 2016 Aaron J. SmithJohn OertleDan WarrenDino PratoDino PratoRead full-textThe HHV-6A (U1102) direct repeat (DR)7 protein, encoded by dr7 (1029 bp), originally identified as ORF-1, has been shown to bind and inhibit p53 function and transform NIH-3T3 cells during transient transfection (Kashanchi et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 1994). These DR7-positive NIH-3T3 cells were oncogenic when injected into nude mice (Kashanchi et al., 1997). Moreover, dr7(640 bp) from HST has been cloned and its protein product was detected in Reed-Sternberg cells of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and was also shown to bind p53 (Lacroix et al., 2010). The DR6 protein from human herpesvirus-6B induces p53-independent cell cycle arrest in G2/M[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: HHV-6B infection inhibits cell proliferation in G2/M, but no protein has so far been recognized to exert this function. Here we identify the protein product of direct repeat 6, DR6, as an inhibitor of G2/M cell-cycle progression. Transfection of DR6 reduced the total number of cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Lentiviral transduction of DR6 inhibited host cell DNA synthesis in a p53-independent manner, and this inhibition was DR6 dose-dependent. A deletion of 66 amino acids from the N-terminal part of DR6 prevented efficient nuclear translocation and the ability to inhibit DNA synthesis. DR6-induced accumulation of cells in G2/M was accompanied by an enhanced expression of cyclin B1 that accumulated predominantly in the cytoplasm. Pull-down of cyclin B1 brought down pCdk1 with the inactivating phosphorylation at Tyr15. Together, DR6 delays cell cycle with an accumulation of cells in G2/M and thus might be involved in HHV-6B-induced cell-cycle arrest.

The preliminary clinical results reported so far do not suggest that IDO inhibitors in combination with checkpoint blockade significantly boost objective response rates [24][25][26]. However, the follow-up data are still premature, with assessment still pending regarding whether IDO inhibition affects durability of these responses or survival over time. A Phase I study of indoximod in patients with advanced malignancies[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Purpose: 
Indoximod is an oral inhibitor of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway, which causes tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity for indoximod in patients with advanced solid tumors. Secondary endpoints included response rates, pharmacokinetics, and immune correlates.

Experimental design: 
Our 3+3 phase I trial comprised 10 dose levels (200, 300, 400, 600, and 800 mg once/day; 600, 800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 mg twice/day). Inclusion criteria were measurable metastatic solid malignancy, age ≥18 years, and adequate organ/marrow function. Exclusion criteria were chemotherapy ≤ 3 weeks prior, untreated brain metastases, autoimmune disease, or malabsorption.

Results: 
In 48 patients, MTD was not reached at 2000 mg twice/day. At 200 mg once/day, 3 patients previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors developed hypophysitis. Five patients showed stable disease >6 months. Indoximod plasma AUC and Cmax plateaued above 1200mg. Cmax (~12 μM at 2000 mg twice/day) occurred at 2.9 hours, and half-life was 10.5 hours. C reactive protein (CRP) levels increased across multiple dose levels.

Conclusions: 
Indoximod was safe at doses up to 2000 mg orally twice/day. Best response was stable disease >6 months in 5 patients. Induction of hypophysitis, increased tumor antigen autoantibodies and CRP levels were observed.

Peptide-based vaccines corresponding to VHL mutated protein and MUC1 have also been investigated in phase trials [42, 43]. Tumor vaccines in renal cell carcinoma[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Although most vaccines target foreign infectious agents, therapeutic cancer vaccines target both well-established and metastatic tumor cells expressing tumor antigens. Active immunotherapy is intended to enhance or activate the immunosurveillance of an individual through a therapeutic vaccine. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most immunoresponsive cancers in humans, which in turn makes it an ideal candidate for immune based therapies.
Several types of therapeutic vaccines have been tested and applied in the clinical setting and can be divided into cell-based vaccines including direct application of inactivated autologous tumor cells, gene modified tumor cell-based, dendritic cell-based (expressing RCC derived tumor antigens), and non-cell-based vaccines. This review will examine the current status of cell-based vaccine immunotherapy and focuses on non-cell-based vaccine strategies.
Recent advances in molecular targeting therapy have introduced a battery receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and mTOR inhibitors that provide promising treatment options, however, the tolerability of tumor vaccines and the success of clinical effectiveness in selected populations combined with recent advances in cellular therapies warrant the continued exploration of novel methods of tumor vaccine therapies in the clinical setting. Full-text · Article · May 2008 Hirotsugu UemuraMarco A. De VelascoRead full-textThese studies have explored many different proteins that are either exclusively or pre-dominantly expressed on colorectal cancer cells (CRC), as potential tumor-specific antigens. The most commonly targeted tumor antigens for therapeutic vaccinations of CRC include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial glycoprotien (Ep-CAM), and guanylyl cyclase 2C (GUCY2C)[34].Table 1shows a list of viral vectors encoding different tumor antigens that have been studied in clinical settings as therapeutic vaccines for CRC. Despite showing excellent safety profiles, these viral vectors have fallen short of showing meaningful anti-tumor effects in large scale clinical trials[35,36]. Viroimmunotherapy for Colorectal Cancer: Clinical Studies[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer incidence and death. Therapies for those with unresectable or recurrent disease are not considered curative at present. More effective and less toxic therapies are desperately needed. Historically, the immune system was thought to be an enemy to oncolytic viral therapy. Thinking that oncolysis would be the only mechanism for cell death, oncolytic virologists theorized that immune clearance was a detriment to oncolysis. Recent advances in our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, and the interplay of tumor survival and a patient’s immune system have called into question our understanding of both arenas. It remains unclear what combination of restrictions or enhancements of innate and/or cell-mediated immunity can yield the highest likelihood of viral efficacy. This article reviews the variety of mechanisms explored for viruses such as immunotherapy for colorectal cancer.Article · Mar 2017 Shyambabu ChaurasiyaSusanne WarnerRead  Top co-authors  View all                  Francesco M Marincola    (18)    Sidra Medical and Research Center   Remove suggestion               Rasha Abu Eid    (17)    University of Aberdeen   Remove suggestion               Bernard A Fox    (12)    Earle A Chiles Research Institute, Portland, Oregon, USA   Remove suggestion               Jerome Galon    (10)    French Institute of Health and Medical Research   Remove suggestion               Giuseppe Masucci    (10)    Karolinska Institutet   Remove suggestion        Top Journals   Journal of Translational Medicine (12)     Journal of Clinical Oncology (7)     Cancer Research (5)     Journla of Immunotherapy (5)     Cancer Immunology Research (5)      Institutions                                                       University of Virginia Charlottesville,  Virginia,  United States                 Disciplines     Me      Medicine    Clinical Immunology Clinical Trials Oncology Hematology          Bi      Biology    Cancer Research Molecular Biology Cell Biology Microbiology Virology Parasitology        Publication Stats    2k  Citations     Browse more researchers
