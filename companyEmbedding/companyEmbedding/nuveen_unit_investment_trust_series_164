Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.


Risk Considerations
				There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately 2 years from the initial date of deposit.

				Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

				Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

				A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

				This trust invests in BDCs and will be subject to risks associated with BDCs. BDCs are closed-end funds that have elected to be treated as business development companies and their ability to grow their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital, engage in borrowing, acquire suitable investments, and maintain their status as a BDC. Failure to do so will adversely affect the value of a BDC’s shares. BDCs generally employ leverage in their portfolios. While leverage often increases the yield of a portfolio, it may magnify the potential for gains and losses on amounts invested, and accordingly, may increase the volatility and/or risks associated with those shares. A BDC’s investments are frequently not publicly traded, and as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments. BDCs are subject to laws or regulations governing BDCs that could negatively affect the value of the BDC shares. Shares of BDCs frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of a BDC’s shares may decrease.

				This trust invests in REITs and real estate companies. Many factors can have an impact on the performance of REITs and real estate companies, including cash available for distribution, the credit quality of a particular REIT, or the real estate industry in general. Risks associated with ownership of real estate include global and local economic conditions, decline in real estate values, changes in interest rates, and the strength or weakness of the real estate market.

				You will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses, but also those of the underlying BDCs and REITs, which frequently have high expenses including but not limited to management fees and operational expenses. By investing in BDCs and REITs through the trust, investors incur greater expenses than they would incur if they invested directly in the BDCs and REITs.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in foreign securities which involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

				BDCs may invest in securities of small and mid-cap companies. Securities of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in fixed income securities. Fixed income securities are subject to various risks, including interest rate, credit, call, and quality risk. In general, the value of the fixed income securities will fall if interest rates rise. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. A security issuer may be unable to make interest and/or principal payments in the future. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.

				BDCs may invest in high yield debt securities. High yield debt securities are generally below investment grade quality (“non-investment grade” debt). Investing in such debt should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such debt. Non-investment grade debt is subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the non-investment grade debt markets, possible downgrades and payment defaults of interest and/or principal. Non-investment grade debt prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated debt and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.

				BDCs and REITs operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and REITs and BDCs must raise additional capital to grow because they distribute most of their income.

				NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

				Incapital Unit Trust, Series 104, is a unit investment trust that consists of multiple portfolios, including the Prospect Income Finance Portfolio, Series 4. Nuveen Securities, LLC serves as the Trust’s sponsor and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC serves as the Trust’s evaluator and supervisor.
				 
				Prospect Capital Management L.P. provides the Trust with portfolio consulting services. Prospect Capital Management L.P. is not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC. The Trust is distributed by Nuveen Securities, LLC, a subsidiary of Nuveen, LLC. All marketing materials have been prepared by Nuveen.

				A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financials sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the financials sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

				Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.
				 
				This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

				Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

				Investing in emerging markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments.

				The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.

				Incapital Unit Trust, Series 106, is a unit investment trust that consists of the Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolio, Series 3. Nuveen Securities, LLC serves as the Trust’s sponsor and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC serves as the Trust’s evaluator and supervisor.

				The MSCI EAFE Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets, excluding the U.S. & Canada. The MSCI EAFE Index consists of the following 22 developed market country indices: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

				The MSCI World Index captures large and mid-cap representation across 23 developed markets countries, including: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the U.S.

				The S&P 500® Index measures the performance of large capitalization U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 is a market weighted index of 500 stocks that are traded on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.

Incapital and Nuveen Investments Expand Unit Trust Partnership

		New Unit Trusts Leverage Expertise of Nuveen's Multi-Affiliate Model

		Enhanced by Incapital Additions to Unit Trust Business

		Nuveen Expands Specialist Sales Support Team for Unit Trusts

CHICAGO, June 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments, today announced the expansion of their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms to support the growth of the unit trust business and better serve the financial advisor community and their clients. Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management. In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.

	Commenting on the partnership, John DesPrez, Incapital's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Incapital's relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients."

INCAPITAL UNIT TRUSTS FEATURING NUVEEN'S INVESTMENT EXPERTISE

	Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments' affiliates:


		Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios

		Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios

		Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios

		Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios

		Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio


	To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes. Capitalizing on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year's series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86. This new unit trust's portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.

	Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments. Recognized for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes. 

	Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments' Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products added, "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors. We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialized investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives." 

JOINT-DISTRIBUTION EFFORT

	Incapital has recently appointed Hugh McHaffie as Managing Director who will soon oversee the origination and distribution of a range of wealth management solutions, including Unit Trust, Market Linked and Annuity offerings. McHaffie is supported by a veteran Unit Trust origination team in Chicago, headed by John Browning, Managing Director and Randy Watts, Executive Director. Pat Dwyer, National Sales Manager, will soon lead Incapital's nation-wide distribution network supporting financial advisors seeking wealth management investment solutions for their clients.

	Given the performance of the current unit trust offerings, strong interest from the market, and robust pipeline of new offerings currently under consideration, Nuveen Investments is also enhancing its unit trust distribution efforts with the appointment of Melissa Roe as Managing Director, National Head of Unit Trust Sales. Overseeing a team of external and internal unit trust specialists, Roe will act as a liaison between Nuveen Investments and Incapital to represent the capabilities of Nuveen Investments' affiliates and ensure that the needs of financial advisors and their investor clients are being served.

Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments have expanded their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms.
Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management. In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.
John DesPrez, Incapital's Chief Executive Officer, says: "Incapital's relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients."
Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments' affiliates:
• Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios
• Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios
• Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios
• Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios
• Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio
To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes. Capitalising on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year's series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86. This new unit trust's portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.
Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments. Recognised for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes. 
Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments' Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products, adds: "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors. We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialised investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives."

Incapital and Nuveen Asset Management Launch Equity Unit Trust Based on Bob Doll's Predictions for 2015

Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio Will Leverage Predictions from Nuveen Asset Management Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist Bob Doll




Jan 15, 2015, 9:00am EST














CHICAGO, Jan. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Asset Management today announced that they have brought to market the next series of an equity unit trust based on the 2015 predictions of well-known Nuveen portfolio manager and strategist Bob Doll. This is the second consecutive year these two investment firms have partnered to bring such a portfolio to market.

The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, deposited on January 14, is designed to offer: 

The potential for capital appreciation for investors willing to accept associated equity market risks 
A high-conviction portfolio from an experienced portfolio manager and widely followed market strategist 
A portfolio approach seeking to limit uncompensated risk 
Investment opportunities not fully reflected in today's stock market valuations
More information about the Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio and other Incapital Unit Trusts is available at incapital.com/UnitTrusts.
Bob Doll, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist for Nuveen Asset Management, is a highly respected authority on the equity markets and regularly provides timely market perspectives to investors, advisors and the media.
The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio is designed to capitalize on the economic and market environment described by Doll's 2015 Ten Predictions, released on January 7th. Incapital serves as the Trust's sponsor and Nuveen Asset Management serves as the Trust's portfolio consultant.
"We are pleased to partner again with Nuveen Asset Management to offer an equity trust product designed specifically for the upcoming market environment," said Phil Johnson, President of Incapital. "This partnership reflects our commitment to deliver diversified investment options to help investors meet their goals."
"Bob Doll's portfolio investment expertise, market insights, and Ten Predictions are highly respected and sought after in the investment community," said William T. Huffman, President of Nuveen Asset Management. "The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio addresses the needs of investors seeking an equity trust option from an experienced portfolio manager and strategist, as well as two firms with a proven track record of innovative product development."  
The partnership between Incapital and Nuveen Asset Management and its affiliates, which kicked off at the end of 2013, has already resulted in the formation of four new unit trust strategies.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.
