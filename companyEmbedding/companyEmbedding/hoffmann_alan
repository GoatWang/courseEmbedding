Herbalife Appoints Alan Hoffman Executive Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs

 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) today announced that it has appointed

      Alan L. Hoffman to the newly established role of Executive Vice

      President of Global Corporate Affairs reporting to Michael O. Johnson,

      Herbalife's chairman and CEO. Hoffman will lead public policy, corporate

      communications, government affairs, community relations and

      philanthropy, effective August 25, 2014.

    


      Hoffman brings over 20 years of public policy, communications and

      government affairs experience to the corporate affairs role. Presently,

      he serves as the Senior Vice President for Global Public Policy at

      PepsiCo, where he oversees policy development, external relations and

      government relations. Hoffman has helped PepsiCo proactively develop and

      implement initiatives to support the company's wide-ranging portfolio of

      products and drive value for its consumers, shareholders and

      communities. Before joining PepsiCo, he served as the Deputy Chief of

      Staff to Vice President Joseph Biden and Deputy Assistant to President

      Barack Obama.

    

Herbalife also today announced that Barbara Henderson will be retiring

      as its Senior Vice President of Global Corporate Communications. In

      2013, she informed the company that she would like to retire at age 67,

      which prompted the search for a new executive. Henderson will assist

      with the transition and will remain President of the Herbalife Family

      Foundation.

    


      "We are thrilled to welcome Alan to the Herbalife team," said Johnson.

      "He brings an unparalleled level of experience to our senior team, and

      we are confident that he has the experience and credentials to help us

      powerfully communicate the value Herbalife brings to our consumers,

      members, shareholders and communities. Barb's retirement, while

      bittersweet, has provided us an opportunity to take a fresh look at our

      organization to make sure our leadership structure best reflects the

      overall needs of the company and puts us in the strongest position going

      forward. After careful consideration, we determined that aligning our

      external affairs activities would benefit Herbalife and all of our

      stakeholders. We look forward to Alan's contributions as we continue to

      advance our mission of helping people live healthier lives."

    


      "Herbalife benefits millions of people around the world and I am proud

      to join the team," said Hoffman. "Herbalife has an enormously important

      mission of improving health and wellness around the globe and I look

      forward to ensuring that the public more clearly understands the

      critical role the company plays in advancing good nutrition. I also look

      forward to promoting the economic opportunities that this global

      nutrition company provides for hard-working people in communities

      everywhere."

    


      Johnson added, "On behalf of everyone at Herbalife, I want to thank Barb

      for her countless contributions to our company over the past 10 years.

      She has been instrumental in telling our important story around the

      world and has tirelessly communicated Herbalife's vision, mission and

      values. While we will miss her in this role, we are excited that she

      will maintain her position as President of the Herbalife Family

      Foundation. She has made an important mark on our company, and we look

      forward to her continued contributions bringing good nutrition to

      vulnerable children."

Herbalife Executive Vice President Alan Hoffman: From the White House to Our House


 


When you’re responsible for shaping the perception of a political candidate, you must define who they are and what they stand for. The same thing goes when you are responsible for helping to shape the messaging of a global nutrition company like Herbalife.

Just ask Herbalife Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs Alan Hoffman, who has also served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Vice President Joseph Biden and Deputy Assistant to President Barack Obama. “Not all companies are created equal,” says Hoffman. “We are open about who we are and because of that, you can only come away being impressed with us.”
Alan is responsible for public policy, corporate communications, government affairs, community relations and all philanthropic efforts on behalf of Herbalife, including the Herbalife Family Foundation. He joined the company in 2014 when Herbalife Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael O. Johnson asked him to spread the word about all of the positive things Herbalife is doing. “Michael is one of the key reasons I came to Herbalife,” says Hoffman. “He’s infectious, dynamic, a great leader and I knew I could learn a lot from him. He gives me the autonomy to do my job. He gives me goals and says go make them happen. He and Joe Biden are very similar in that way.”

Alan’s overarching goal at the company is to clearly define for the world who Herbalife is and what it aspires to be, which might be best summed up by the mission statement written on the whiteboard in his office: To be the premier nutrition company in the world. “There’s a genius in this company, with its desire and ability to improve lives with good nutrition, as well as the economic opportunity it presents to those who are interested,” says Hoffman. “We are not always perceived the way that we know the company is in actuality. I want to change the narrative and the way people think about us. If we want to be known as the premier nutrition company in the world, we have to do everything in our power to make ourselves a part of the conversation.”
So what is Hoffman doing to help shine a light on the many great things that Herbalife is doing? It’s a multiyear and multifaceted effort, part of which involves deploying tens of thousands of Independent Herbalife Members who are already thoroughly engaged in their communities to spread the word about the company. Recent Herbalife rallies in Los Angeles and Chicago have been tremendously effective in generating awareness for the company and its products. Partnerships with the Special Olympics World Games and the American Red Cross have lent the company a high degree of credibility, while also providing it with greater visibility. Herbalife has also been doing more traditional media, finding success with a televised commercial that ran in Miami and Los Angeles in early 2015.
Herbalife is proud to have on its side someone like Hoffman, who is a champion of everything the company is and stands for. And the feeling is mutual. “Coming to work for Herbalife was a great decision,” says Hoffman. “We are moving forward in all aspects of the business as we continuously ‘Build It Better.’”
