DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Funds today announced that it has completed the final closing for Lone Star Fund X (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund X (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSF X").  Total capital available is approximately $5.6 billion, which includes LSF X commitments and an anticipated co-investment from associated entities.
Commitments to LSF X exceeded LSF X's original target of $5 billion.








In April, Lone Star announced it had closed Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSREF V"), its fifth dedicated commercial real estate fund, at approximately $5.8 billion, exceeding its $5 billion fundraising target and reaching its $5.5 billion hard cap for third party commitments.
Lone Star, a global private equity firm, invests on behalf of its limited partners, which include institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, as well as foundations and endowments that support medical research, higher education, and other philanthropic causes.  
Lone Star is a highly disciplined, value-driven investor that focuses on opportunities that emerge during periods of market dislocation, often providing liquidity to markets in the aftermath of a financial crisis.  Lone Star focuses on businesses, sellers, and assets that require capital support and management direction to succeed post-crisis. In this context, Lone Star considers a broad scope of markets, industries, and opportunities through equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, real estate and real estate-related assets, control investments in operating companies, and securitized products. 
Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has organized seventeen private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments exceeding $70 billion.

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.
