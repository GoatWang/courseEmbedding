Northern Fund Management America announces the closing of Northern Shipping Fund III LP


Stamford, CT, December 20, 2016 – Northern Fund Management America LLC (“Northern Shipping”), a leading alternative capital provider to the shipping and offshore oil service sectors, announced today that it has completed a final closing for Northern Shipping Fund III LP, (the “Fund”) with total investor commitments of $505 million.  The Fund is one of the largest funds dedicated to maritime credit.
The oversubscribed maritime credit fund, managed by Northern Shipping, exceeded its initial target of $400 million.  The Fund received commitments from a diverse group of institutional investors including public and private pension plans and other institutions, as well as high net worth family offices and shipping executives.
Led by Sean Durkin and Sybren Hoekstra, the Fund will continue the firm’s strategy of directly originating, structuring and maintaining a diversified portfolio of investments within the maritime sector. 
“We are pleased to have received strong support from institutional investors and large family offices who value our asset based credit strategy and our focus on capital preservation and current yield” said Sean Durkin, Managing Partner, Northern Shipping. 
“We believe that a favorable investment climate exists for our alternative credit strategy as the maritime sector continues to suffer from the retrenchment of traditional lending from European banks” said Sybren Hoekstra, Managing Partner.
Eaton Partners, LLC and Manor Private Capital, LLC served as placements agents for the Fund.  Seward & Kissel served as counsel to the Fund.
About Northern Shipping:
Stamford-based Northern Shipping employs 16 investment professionals with broad expertise in maritime finance.  Northern Shipping represents a stable source of capital, providing structuring flexibility and superior execution.  For more information, please visit www.northernshippingfunds.com.

Packaging Supplies in Greater San Francisco Bay Area

Packaging Supplies at PostalAnnex in Greater San Francisco Bay Area
At each PostalAnnex, you’ll find a variety of packaging supplies:  cardboard (corrugated) boxes, bubble wrap, Pelaspan® loosefill (also known as packaging peanuts or packaging popcorn), packaging tape, padded/bubble mailing envelopes, decorative mailers in both box and padded envelope variations, shipping/mailing tubes and many others.
The correct choice of packaging supplies affects several factors in the delivery of your shipment:

The proper shipping product will protect your contents against damage;
Choosing the right product will keep your contents from falling out of, or becoming loose from, the packaging;
Selecting the best size for your shipment not only protects your contents, but can minimize shipping costs as well.  If you select a packaging product too large for the contents, it may incur oversize charges on ground shipments, and dimensional weight charges on air shipments.  (Dimensional weight is the rated weight, not the actual weight, based on the size of the shipping container.

At PostalAnnex, our packaging supplies professional can help you choose the right product for your shipment to ensure its protection as well as minimize shipping costs.
And the packaging professionals at each PostalAnnex have years of experience in knowing how to properly pack your items to survive the shipping environment of tosses, tumbles and drops.
From special packaging tape to 1/8” foam to protect shipments of dinnerware, we’ve got a variety of packaging supplies to offer you.  And what we don’t have in-store, we often can get in as little as 24 hours.
So whether you want to pack at home or have us help you in the store, choose PostalAnnex for the right packaging supplies; you’ll certainly save time and may even save money!
