Important information for U.S. shareholders holding their positions through DTC
Effective October 17, 2014, Largo completed a consolidation of its common shares on a 10 for 1 basis as previously approved by the shareholders.
At that time, approximately 2% of the issued shares were held through the DTC registration system (predominantly due to purchases on the OTC Bulletin Board).
Following the consolidation, and due to new guidelines on exemptions for rule 144(i) implemented at the SEC , DTC requested certain documents and opinions from Largo to maintain its eligibility.
As Largo is not quantified as a reporting issuer in the US, and as a result of this newer SEC guidance, Largo's shares are no longer DTC eligible. As a result, DTC will be pushing the securities out to its participants.
Shareholders affected by this issue should contact their brokers to make arrangements for the securities to either be held through CDS or in physical format.

Largo recommends that investors interested in trading its shares from the US, should use a broker that has trading and registration arrangements in Canada or otherwise trade through US subsidiaries of Canadian banks.

Forward-looking Statements
This website may contain forward-looking information (including forward-looking information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Reform Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning Largo’s operations and future financial results. You should note that forward-looking information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Largo and the business areas in which it operates to differ materially from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in the forward-looking information. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation, changes in market or world pricing for the commodities produced by Largo, foreign exchange exposure and sovereign risk, and risks particular to the businesses Largo operates. 
The information presented contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and “forward‑looking information” under similar Canadian legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of the Company. Forward-looking statements and forward‑looking information include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources; the realization of mineral reserve estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; costs of production; metal prices and demand for materials; capital expenditures; success of exploration and development activities; permitting time lines and permitting, mining or processing issues; government regulation of mining operations; environmental risks; and title disputes or claims. Generally, forward-looking statements and forward‑looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “plans,” “expects” or “does not expect,” “is expected,” “budget,” “scheduled,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “anticipates” or “does not anticipate,” or “believes,”, “projects” or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may,” “could,” “would,” “might” or “will be taken,” “occur” or “be achieved.” Forward-looking statements and forward‑looking information are based on the opinions and estimates of management as of the date such statements are made, and they are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or forward‑looking information, including, but not limited to, unexpected events during operations; variations in ore grade; risks inherent in the mining industry; delay or failure to receive board approvals;  timing and availability of external financing on acceptable terms; risks relating to international operations; actual results of exploration activities; conclusions of economic valuations; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; and fluctuating metal prices and currency exchange rates. Although management of the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements or forward‑looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and forward‑looking information. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements or forward‑looking information that are incorporated by reference herein, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.
Investors are advised that National Instrument 43-101 Standards for disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”)of the Canadian Securities Administrators requires that each category of mineral reserves and mineral resources be reported separately. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated or Inferred Resources 
The information presented uses the terms “measured,” “indicated” and “inferred” mineral resources. United States investors are advised that while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize these terms. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. United States investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
 
Except as otherwise specifically stated, Mr. Robert Campbell, Vice President of Exploration to Largo, and/or Mr. Michael Mutchler, both Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 have reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained herein

Company Profile


LGO:TSX | OTCQB:LGORFLargo Resources Ltd. is a growing strategic mineral company with projects in Brazil and Canada. Largo is presently focused on the production of vanadium at its Maracás Menchen Mine.



Investment Highlights

Largo Resources Ltd. (TSX:LGO) (OTCQB:LGORF) is a mid-tier mining development company primarily focused on the production of vanadium at its Maracás Menchen Mine in Brazil. 

Largo has accomplished a unique feat in the mining industry, by successfully financing, building and bringing a project to production in a trying market environment and in a unique commodity. 

Largo’s Maracás Menchen Mine boasts the highest grade vanadium deposit yet discovered and is a low cost producer. With an off-take in place with commodities giant Glencore, Largo is well positioned to become the leading producer of vanadium globally and expects to generate substantial cash-flows.

Vanadium is primarily used as an alloy to strengthen steel and reduce its weight. Vanadium enhanced steels are used in a vast and growing range of products that we use and encounter every day; including, rebar, automobiles, transport infrastructure etc. With a compound annual growth rate of over 6% for the past several years, vanadium is a bourgeoning commodity, with concentrated supply which lacks opportunities for investment in the wider market place. As trends in the steel industry now demand increasingly stronger and lighter products for advanced applications, the use of vanadium is expected to continue this growth over the medium and long term. 

As Largo continues producing at its Maracás Menchen Mine and generating cash-flows, it presents a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to the vanadium market.

Company Overview

Team: Click to ViewWebsite: largoresources.comLargo Resources Ltd. is a growing strategic mineral company focused on the production of vanadium pentoxide at its Vanadio de Maracás Menchen Mine. Vanadium is primarily used as an alloy to strengthen steel and reduce its weight. Vanadium enhanced steels are used in a vast and growing range of products that are used and encountered every day; including, rebar, automobiles, transport infrastructure etc. With consumption increasing at a compound annual growth rate of over 8% for the past several years (Roskill, 2015), vanadium is a bourgeoning commodity which lacks opportunities for investment in the wider market place. As trends in the steel industry now demand increasingly stronger and lighter products for advanced applications, the use of vanadium is expected to continue this growth over the medium and long term.

The Lender will also receive a restructuring fee that may be payable in common shares. Any debt-to-equity conversion contemplated by the Agreement will be subject to receipt of all required approvals.It is expected that, upon conversion of the debt to common shares, the Lender will enter into a lock-up agreement under which it will not sell, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of the converted common shares for six months from the execution of the Agreement.Details of the BRL Facility RestructuringIt is anticipated that, under the terms of the Agreement, the payment schedule for the BRL Facility will be amended to allow Vanádio up to 290 days from the execution of the Agreement to pay USD $8,500,000 (approximately BRL $26,800,000 ) towards the outstanding amount of the BRL Facility (the "Initial Payment"). If, following the Initial Payment, the outstanding amount of the BRL Facility is higher than BRL $69,000,000 , Vanádio must make an additional payment to reduce the outstanding amount of the BRL Facility to this amount.Upon fulfilment of the Initial Payment, it is expected that the remaining amount outstanding under the BRL Facility will be refinanced through a new loan agreement, the terms of which are likely to include:Mark Smith , President and Chief Executive Officer for Largo, stated: "We believe that the proposed restructuring of these facilities will result in a debt profile that enables the Company to more accurately match its future cash flows with its debt servicing obligations. We are very pleased with the strong support shown by Banco Pine in working with the Company to find a solution that benefits both parties.  This outcome would not have been possible without all of the hard work of the Largo team that has enabled us to provide stable production at a low unit cost. This foundation along with our world class resource will ensure the future success of Largo as vanadium prices continue to rise."About LargoLargo Resources Ltd. is a growing strategic mineral company focused on the production of vanadium pentoxide at its Vanadio de Maracás Menchen Mine. Vanadium is primarily used as an alloy to strengthen steel and reduce its weight. Vanadium enhanced steels are used in a vast and growing range of products that are used and encountered every day; including, rebar, automobiles, transport infrastructure etc. As trends in the steel industry now demand increasingly stronger and lighter products for advanced applications, the use of vanadium is expected to grow over the medium and long term. Largo also has interests in a portfolio of other projects, including: a 100% interest in the Currais Novos Tungsten Tailings Project in Brazil ; a 100% interest in the Campo Alegre de Lourdes Iron-Vanadium Project in Brazil ; and a 100% interest in the Northern Dancer Tungsten-Molybdenum property in the Yukon Territory, Canada .
