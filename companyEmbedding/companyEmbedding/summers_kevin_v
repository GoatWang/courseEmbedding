      develop and execute our strategy for the future.”
    

      As CIO, Summers will be responsible for all aspects of IT, including 
      continuing to develop a technology portfolio that can seamlessly support 
      the operations of the company’s stores, distribution network, e-commerce 
      platforms, and future business technology needs. He earned a bachelor’s 
      degree in computer science from The College of Charleston and an M.B.A. 
      from Duke University.
