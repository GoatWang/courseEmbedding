All rights reserved. Company number 05936182. Three Levels of a Product  LessonExerciseAnswerThree Levels of a Product.Consumers often think that a product is simply the physical item that he or she buys. In order to actively explore the nature of a product further, let’s consider it as three different products – the CORE product, the ACTUAL product, and finally the AUGMENTED product. This concept is known as the Three Levels of a Product.Three Levels of a ProductThe CORE product is NOT the tangible physical product. You can’t touch it. That’s because the core product is the BENEFIT of the product that makes it valuable to you. So with the car example, the benefit is convenience i.e. the ease at which you can go where you like, when you want to. Another core benefit is speed since you can travel around relatively quickly.The ACTUAL product is the tangible, physical product. You can get some use out of it. Again with the car, it is the vehicle that you test drive, buy and then collect. You can touch it. The actual product is what the average person would think of under the generic banner of product.The AUGMENTED product is the non-physical part of the product. It usually consists of lots of added value, for which you may or may not pay a premium. So when you buy a car, part of the augmented product would be the warranty, the customer service support offered by the car’s manufacturer and any after-sales service. The augmented product is an important way to tailor the core or actual product to the needs of an individual customer. The features of augmented products can be converted in to benefits for individuals.Features and benefits of productsFeatures and benefits of a product are also relevant to the three levels of the product. Products tend to have a whole series of features but only a small number of benefits to the actual consumer.Let’s look at this another way, if you buy a Nintendo console it has many features; for example you can play games alone or you can play against another opponent or two or three opponents. You can also have access to the Internet. Avatars are adaptable so you can create yourself and your friends. These are all examples of features to the consumer. However a consumer may buy it because he or she wants to stay fit and will use software and peripherals to become healthier. Becoming healthier is the benefit to the consumer.The consistent marketer will aim to discover the consumer’s preference for benefits and will match individual features to the preference. That is why professional salespeople for example, often ask many questions whereas a novice salesperson will just tell you the features of the product.New Product Development (NPD)New Product Development (NPD) will take in to account the consumer’s preference for benefits over features by considering research into their needs. NPD aims to satisfy and anticipate needs. NPD delivers products which offer benefits at the core, actual and augmented levels.NPD might offer a replacement product for a current line, it could add products to the current line, it could discover new product lines and sometimes it delivers very innovative products which the world might not have seen before.New products are launched for all sorts of reasons. As we know from our previous lesson on the business environment, legislation i.e. changes in the law can mean that companies have to design and develop new products. An example of this was when we moved from videotape recorders to digital and DVD recorders. So products need to be modified for changing target markets.Sometimes the company will need to increase the volume that a production plant delivers, since maybe it is not running at full capacity. An example of this would be a food manufacturer of tinned soup that has a factory which can operate 24/7, designing different derivatives of the soup in order to lower the unit cost of production. So product lines are extended, in this case the reason being is to ease operational efficiency.Intense competitive rivalry in the market will also lead to the need for NPD. Just think about your smart phone and how quickly such products go through their product life cycles, throughout your customer life-cycle.Change in any element of the marketing mix would influence NPD, for example there is a movement to shop online and some products need to be distributed via online retailers, and the product is adapted to make it compact and simple to deliver. NPD can be driven by many influences from changing consumer tastes to the need to adapt products and services for local or international market.Another marketing tool for evaluating PRODUCT is the Product Life Cycle (PLC). Also see the Customer Life Cycle (CLC).Published by Tim Friesner Marketing Teacher designs and delivers online marketing courses, training and resources for marketing learners, teachers and professionals.

description:

In the 1960's, the economist Philip Kotler changed the perception of marketing. He described what marketing is rather than what marketers do, thereby changing marketing from a departmental specialisation into a corporate wide doctrine. For Kotler, marketing was a 'social process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products and value with others'. For him, a product is more than physical. A product is anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, or use, or something that can satisfy a need or want. Therefore, a product can be a physical good, a service, a retail store, a person, an organisation, a place or even an idea. Products are the means to an end wherein the end is the satisfaction of customer needs or wants. Kotler distinguished three components:need: a lack of a basic requirement; want: a specific requirement for products or services to match a need; demand: a set of wants plus the desire and ability to pay for the exchange.  Customers will choose a product based on their perceived value of it. Satisfaction is the degree to which the actual use of a product matches the perceived value at the time of the purchase. A customer is satisfied only if the actual value is the same or exceeds the perceived value. Kotler defined five levels to a product: 1. Core Benefit the fundamental need or want that consumers satisfy by consuming the product or service. 2. Generic Producta version of the product containing only those attributes or characteristics absolutely necessary for it to function. 3. Expected Productthe set of attributes or characteristics that buyers normally expect and agree to when they purchase a product. 4. Augmented Productinclusion of additional features, benefits, attributes or related services that serve to differentiate the product from its competitors. 5. Potential Productall the augmentations and transformations a product might undergo in the future. Kotler noted that much competition takes place at the Augmented Product level rather than at the Core Benefit level or, as Levitt put it: 'New competition is not between what companies produce in their factories, but between what they add to their factory output in the form of packaging, services, advertising, customer advice, financing, delivery arrangements, warehousing, and other things that people value.' Kotler's model provides a tool to assess how the organisation and their customers view their relationship and which aspects create value.

 What Are the Three Levels of Marketing? | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  What Are the Three Levels of Marketing?  by Robert Morello        Many companies divide their marketing efforts into levels for easier management. Creatas Images/Creatas/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Three Levels] | Describe the Three Levels of Strategy for a Single-Business Company 2 [Different Levels] | The Different Levels of Market Segmentation 3 [Marketing Plan] | A High-Level Marketing Plan 4 [Seven Functions] | Seven Functions of Marketing    Product marketing can be divided into levels based on the state of the market and the types of consumers you are targeting. These levels are separated by the marketer's objective, the state of the marketplace and the type of product the marketer wishes to promote.        Purpose Marketing is separated into levels of approach so that the market can be targeted in a more specific and effective way. To attack every market segment in the same way may prove inefficient and wasteful in many cases. Depending on the industry and the goals of your marketing department, the level of marketing pursued will likely vary. In cases where your product meets the established needs of the market, your main marketing concern is typically other brands. When market analysis reveals potential openings in the marketplace, your marketing may have to adapt. When your new product is without an audience, it may be up to your marketing efforts to create one. Meeting Established Needs A campaign that attempts to meet the established needs of a target segment is the primary and most basic form of marketing. It requires no special analysis or psychology to be successful and is based only on announcing the presence of a supply to meet the existing demand. This first level of marketing is used constantly by large and small businesses to sell product to existing market segments and to ensure that companies deliver what is clearly and consistently desired or needed by the public. The challenge in such situations is often not to drive consumer demand, but to gain an advantage over industry competitors with your price point, features and advertising message or market presence. Looking for Openings When marketers study a marketplace to find gaps between existing products, they are engaging in the second level of marketing. In such cases, the demand for a new product or approach has not been established, but significant room exists for a company to develop within the current framework. For example, let's say there are electric-powered sports cars on the market and electric-powered SUVs. The gap between these two products leaves the door open for a manufacturer who can offer an electric-powered sedan to jump in and create a new market segment. This second level of marketing requires foresight and insight to manage and the flexibility of a company to meet the changing opportunities that may arise. Creating Demand The third and most difficult level of marketing to find success with is one that requires the marketer to establish demand where none existed prior. This third level of marketing is undertaken despite a lack of space or an established need. It is the truest form of marketing and the level that requires the most skill and creativeness to manipulate. The marketer is essentially convincing the consumer that her product is worth a purchase and that it necessary to a happy or safe lifestyle in some way. For example, if you build a new speed cooker, you will have to show people what makes it better than the microwave in such a way as to convince the consumer to make the investment and the change from what they're used to. If companies can manage to transform their products from the "new" thing to the industry standard, the potential for success is unlimited.

Augmented Product/Three Product Levels Concept















































 
 
 















Augmented Product Concept
(Three Levels Of A Product/Total Product Concept)
Introduction






In the book "Principles Of Marketing" Philip Kotler et al devised a very interesting concept of benefit building for products. Kotler suggested that if you view a product on three levels it will help you extract all the benefits that your product offers. This strategy has various names including Total Product Concept, Augmented Product and Three Levels Of a Product.


The diagram below shows the three levels that make up the total product concept



Level One: Core Product 
Level one is the most basic level and simply looks at what people set out to buy and what benefits the producer would like their product to offer buyers.  For example a camera is expected to take pictures but there may be other benefits that the producer wants the buyer to enjoy such as a wide lens, face recognition and high definition videos. So prior to designing any product  designers should list the core benefits the product needs to provide.







Level 2: Actual Product
Level two is about translating the list of core product benefits into a product that people will buy. There may be competitor products offering the same benefits so the aim at this stage is to design a product that will persuade people to purchase your product. Kotler states that this can involve deciding on the quality level, product and service features, styling, branding and packaging. For example Apple's iPhone design has enabled it to become a smart phone market leader so that by September 2012 it was able to launch the iPhone 5, the 5th version of this product. There are other smart phones on the market but Apple has managed to design a product which people pre-order and camp overnight outside Apple's retail stores so that they can be the first ones to buy the product. 








Level 3: Augmented product





Level three involves deciding the additional non tangible benefits that a product can offer. Competition at this level is based around after sales service, help lines, warranties, free/cheap delivery and so on. In other words it is things that the product does not do but customers may find them useful. Non tangible benefits such as product warranties offer customers peace of mind and demonstrate the manufacturer has faith in the quality of its product. In fact the ubiquitous use of some augmented benefits have turn some level three benefits into a customer expectation  for example customers expect cars  to have manufacturer warranties.

Reader ApprovedwikiHow to Succeed in Multi Level Marketing
Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a business structure in which a company recruits distributors to sell the company's products directly to the public. Those distributors also recruit others to sell the products. Some of the world's largest companies use MLM, also known as direct sales or network marketing, as part of their marketing strategies. Your personal goals and ambition may determine whether your business is a success.








Steps






1

Decide what business success means to you. Some direct sellers want to earn enough money to take a vacation. Others want to build a 6-figure business. Knowing what you want to achieve with your business will help you design a successful business strategy.









2

Create a schedule for multi-level marketing success. Your schedule should reflect the income level you want to reach and the time you want to commit to your business.


Dedicate 3 to 10 hours per week to your business, if your goal is to work part-time in direct sales, so you can earn extra money.
Devote 15 or more hours per week to your business if you intend to recruit others and build a large direct sales business.








3

Take advantage of the training that your company provides.

Multi-level marketing companies design training to help you with business success. Most companies provide training in both sales and product knowledge. Training materials may include brochures, manuals or recorded audio and video classes.
Participate in seminars or training sessions that the company offers. These sessions may be live events or virtual events held via teleconferencing or video conferencing. At these training events, you can learn about new products and the latest business success strategies.








4

Utilize the professionally designed online and offline sales and marketing tools that your company provides. Online tools include company-approved websites, email addresses and banners. Offline materials include business cards, brochures, catalogs and sales flyers.








5

Attend networking events to meet people who may be interested in purchasing your product or in becoming a distributor.

One of the best ways to achieve multi-level marketing success is to share the products and business opportunity with other people.
Practice giving a 1- to 2-minute speech about your business. Many networking events give participants time to introduce themselves and their businesses.
Your speech should include your name, your company name, the types of products you sell and the benefits of the products.
Ask your employer (the person who recruited you) to help you draft and practice your speech.








6

Showcase your products and business opportunity by holding events in your home or in the homes of potential distributors.

With this type of "party plan" marketing, distributors do most of their business through parties. During the party, you should demonstrate the products and describe the business opportunity.
Make the party a fun gathering with refreshments and games.








7

Use social networking websites to promote your business. Let your friends and contacts know about your business and ask them to help you meet your goals.


Hold online parties and business networking events using social networking websites. Direct sellers often find network marketing success in virtual events that allow more people to participate than if they had to attend an event in person.

Tips


When you first begin your business, ask the person who recruited you to help you organize your online and offline events.





Warnings


Although social networking sites are a good place to meet people and promote your business, don't spend all your time advertising your business. You will alienate your friends and contacts if you come across as a pushy salesperson.
Carefully read the policies, procedures and terms of your agreement with the company. You should understand what types of advertising and marketing you can use to promote your business. Most companies and the law prohibit you from sending unsolicited email to promote your products.

The problem is partly that new products aren’t developed and put through their paces in a systematic enough way to let marketing men know when a test market is really in order. Compounding this difficulty is that the goals of test marketing are sometimes unclear and that the information, once gathered, is often improperly used. This article is an attempt to lay bare the bones of the issue. Beginning with an overview of sound new product development, it clarifies when a test market should be done, what its aims should be, and to what uses it should be put. Relying for many of their judgments on quoted first-person interview material with marketing executives, the authors finish with a postscript on how technological innovation can aid in test marketing.

The executive must weigh a myriad of information as he decides whether to go with a new product. To help him in his decision, he may consider test marketing to gather yet more information.
For the executive contemplating test marketing, we intend to focus first on three strategic questions:

When should you conduct a test market? 


What can you learn from a test market? 


How should you use information from a test market? 

We will then explore recent developments in new product research—specifically, the use of simulation models and test markets in the laboratory environment.
The questions and answers that follow reflect test marketing experiences we gathered from 31 marketing research executives who had been involved in hundreds of new product introductions. (See the sidebar “Commentators” for the list of interviewees.) These products included packaged grocery items, health-care products, and consumer durables. The executives represent three orientations toward test markets—the manufacturer, the advertising agency, and the marketing research supplied.

Whether to test market is a compromise between collecting more information, at considerable direct and indirect cost, to reduce uncertainty, and introducing the product immediately to make money. As Posner points out, “Every month in test means giving up sales if the product turns out to be successful.” 
  
The direct costs of test marketing include a pilot plant to make the product, commercials, an advertising agency because media are not billed, point-of-sale material produced in small quantities, higher media expenses because of low volumes, couponing, sampling, and higher trade allowances to obtain distribution. For example, the cost for a typical two-city test market in 1975 was $250,000. Four tests were required to test two levels of ad weight. This meant a market testing cost of $500,000.
But there are also indirect costs. There is, for example, the cost of revealing a new product idea to a competitor. If he is better organized for new product introductions, he can beat you to the market. It is hard to estimate the cost of being second in the market, but marketing experience indicates that it means a lower market share and higher promotional costs.
Another indirect cost is that of exposure. “If you are promoting a family brand, you are exposing the name of your company as well as the brand,” Clay-camp reminds.







“If you get a reputation for bombing, you may have trouble getting distribution the next time, or in enlisting the enthusiasm of the sales force,” observes Kuehn. It is impossible to estimate these exposure costs.
Diversion of employee time and activities is an internal, out-of-pocket expense that is rarely quantified when the cost of test markets is estimated. “The internal costs for test marketing are incredible. They divert management attention and manpower from other activities,” McMennamin warns.
Adds Newman, “Sales management objects to too many test markets because they take away from sales activities.”
These high direct and indirect costs of test marketing provide a strong incentive for postponing the decision to test market until the marketing executive feels confident he has the three basic elements of the ideal product development plan secure: a successful product, a competitive marketing strategy, and a superior communication plan. Many researchers feel that test marketing should be the last check before rolling the product out into national distribution. “I would say the batting average ought to be somewhere between 65% and 75%,” Pearson calculates.
Light maintains that “when you go into test market, you’ve made the decision to go. The test market can of course alter your plans by giving you a no-go. But in the absence of bad results, you continue.” 
  
The rising costs of test markets have led researchers to use less expensive methods to kill a product or advertising campaign early in the process of new product development. “You certainly don’t want to use a test market to learn something that you could have learned earlier—test marketing is much too expensive,” Longman insists.
Implicit in the comments of our marketing executives is a well-articulated new product development process. It is to this process that the executives tacitly appeal when they make their judgments on the costs of test marketing.
A conceptualization of this process appears in the exhibit, “An Idealized Process For New Product Development.” Here we can see how a product and a communication plan should be refined before test marketing. 



Exhibit An Idealized Process For New Product Development 




When Should You Conduct a Test Market? 
The first step in the new product sequence is an identification of opportunities—needs not being met adequately by products that are currently available. This phase of research frequently uses qualitative techniques borrowed from social psychology. One method often used is the focus-group or group-depth interview. This is a two-hour discussion in which 8 to 12 persons are asked to describe their experiences with present products or to recount how they handle specific problems.
For example, a pharmaceutical company may ask a group of young mothers how they treat a child’s cold. Mothers’ perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of available products will come to light during these discussions. Such interviews provide concepts for new products or for extension of present products. These concepts are actually hypotheses that can then be tested with more quantitative methods such as the survey.
Elimination of all but a few of the concepts is naturally a subjective process. It may be based on the experience of marketing executives, the politics of the company, or the executives’ definition of their business and its capacity. (Capacity should be defined to include not only production and financial capabilities, but also executives’ ability to operate in the industry of the proposed product.)







The number of product concepts finally chosen depends on the resources of the company and its strategy for new products. Given limited resources, should a company select only one or two concepts and spend most of its resources on developing communication plans, or should it retain four or five product concepts and test only a few communication plans for each one? The answer to this question must reflect the history and strengths of the organization. If most of its resources are in product R&D, it will probably experiment more with concepts than if its strength is in marketing and communications.
The next step in our ideal new product development is creating a preliminary profit plan that estimates the length of the payout. Based largely on estimates by experienced marketing executives, this profit plan can eliminate product candidates that do not reach the minimum payout period set by management. 
  
(Each stage in the exhibit replaces management estimates with data, thereby reducing the range of uncertainty in estimating the profit plan.)
The center section of the exhibit has three columns—product development, strategy development, and communication development. These columns emphasize a very important point: the steps contained in them are taken simultaneously, not serially. Advertising development, for example, does not wait until a product is refined before starting its work, but begins immediately on the problem of communicating the concept reflected in the item.
Anticipated availability of a product in part determines the methods for its testing. For instance, a minimum of facilities may be required to produce actual products for testing a product extension such as the addition of a lemon flavor to an existing brand. In contrast, a new home entertainment center requires a whole new production facility. In this latter case, the concept is pretested in the first stage of product testing and the product in the second stage. (See the exhibit.) At the conclusion of these concept and product tests, the profit plan can then be revised to take into account information derived from the research. These new data suggest levels of production costs and therefore of product acceptability. If a proposed product meets the minimum payout period, it can then go into extended product use tests.
Marketing strategy requires setting goals, pricing strategies, and distribution strategies for a new product. Rough estimates of price ranges may be part of product testing. If your company plans to use its present channels of distribution, the channel strategy may be that of determining how to get your channel to accept the new product. If the strategy includes the development of a new channel—such as was required by the successful Hanes strategy of distributing “L’eggs” hosiery through supermarkets—considerable work may be needed to estimate the costs of such a tactic.
Communication strategy includes the development of the package, the copy theme for advertisements, and the selection of the desired media mix. It is important to note that the communication plan feeds into the development of the marketing mix plans for strategy development. The estimated cost of the communication plan is input for the final estimated profit plan. The plan is then submitted to management for approval in order to proceed to the test market stage.
When, then, should a test market be done? The experience of our experts suggests strongly that, as Saint says, “You go into test market under the assumption that you have a successful product.”
What Can You Learn? 
But when product and communications research have already told you that you have a successful product and communication plan, why should you go to the expense of test marketing, adding to the costs of delayed revenues from a successful item?
Our survey indicates that the primary purpose of a test market is to provide, as Newman puts it, a “good dress rehearsal for testing all of the product elements together, not individually.” Before the test market, the product and the communication plan have been tested separately. The test market combines both these elements. Furthermore, it tests the elements of the plan and their combinations in the real world. It is, Posner says, a “microcosm of what you will be doing and what will happen nationally.” 
  
A real-world test of the marketing plan will provide estimates of marketing plan productivity, suggestions for improving the plan’s productivity, and a disaster check.
Productivity of the marketing plan 
The test market provides measures of consumers’ responses to those elements that have been pretested—the product, the price, and the communication plan. It also measures the trade’s acceptance of the product, the strategy, and the communication plan. (In most cases, the company can rely on its experience with the trade to estimate future acceptance.)
Consumer response 
By measuring levels of consumer awareness, product trial, repeat purchase, market share, and sales volume, the test market gives some indication of the productivity of the elements of the marketing plan. These measures are the basis for making the “go/no-go” decision. Such a decision can be made on the basis of rule-of-thumb—for example, drop the product if the trial rate is less than 60%. The decision is then a financial one, the data from the test markets having been inputs into the profit plan.
Test markets provide better estimates of consumer response than any pretesting. But, as Claycamp emphasizes, “About all you can expect from a test market is the answers to the questions that you are asking of it. In other words, one has to be very specific about what one wants from a test market. For this reason, they really are designed only for go/no-go decisions.”
Pearson agrees: “Test marketing can tell you if you have a loser, a medium success, or a giant success. It cannot fine-tune a payout plan between a two share and a three share.”
However, Ossip asserts that “we find test markets useful in telling us whether we will make our minimum.”
Lavidge sees two reasons for a test market: “One reason to test market is to decide how much of the product is likely to sell so that you can decide whether to go national. The other reason to test market is to determine how to market the product.”
Trade response 
“How to market” includes the question of trade acceptance—which, in many cases, has not been tested in the process of new product development. Saint describes the problem: “Suppose Chesebrough came out with an entirely new product in an unfamiliar product category. The Chesebrough sales force and Chesebrough as a company have built a fine reputation in the health and beauty-aid field. But in this case you would be taking the Chesebrough salesman and putting him in a new buyer’s office. The soap buyer wouldn’t know the salesman. So you would want to see the capacity of your sales force to sell an unfamiliar product to unfamiliar buyers.” Thus acceptance of a new product is greatly dependent on experience and a successful track record. 
  
Experience in the product category enables the researcher to make reliable estimates of trade acceptance. “If you don’t know what kind of distribution your sales force is capable of getting, either you don’t know much about your sales people or else they are very unreliable,” Pearson contends.
Experienced researchers estimate that the effect of the extra emphasis given by the sales force in the test market gains a 15% to 17% higher sales level than would be achieved after having gone national with the product. Eggert affirms this: “In a test, you get more emphasis, since the sales manager visits the place two or three times. And just the sheer fact that he visits adds impetus to a product.”
Being first with a new product is extremely important in the grocery-product category, where limited shelf space in a store constrains distribution. When Gillette successfully introduced “The Dry Look,” a hair spray for men, several other companies tried to cash in on the success by introducing hair sprays of their own. Since hair sprays came in much larger containers than most hair preparations for men, more shelf space was required to stock the same number of competing brands. And because retailers tend to devote a fixed amount of shelf space to a particular product category, many of the companies with me-too products had difficulty getting trade acceptance for copied items.
When measuring trade acceptance is not a problem (as is often the case), a marketer may use a controlled store test, which greatly reduces the time required to run a test market.
A successful test market can improve the sales force’s ability to obtain distribution during national introduction. A resounding success in, say, Albany is often useful to the salesman seeking trade acceptance in St. Louis. The salesman is equipped with real market results, not in-house test results or the results of a survey. The only question is whether the results in Albany are applicable to the situation in St. Louis.
How to improve marketing productivity 
As we discussed earlier, you should run a test market only after extensive pretesting has shown that your new product will be a winner. And even though it is useful to get better estimates of consumer and trade acceptance, some marketers design their test markets to provide these better estimates and to provide information that will enable them to improve the productivity of the plan. As Schucker says, “Before test marketing, you are convinced at least that the business is there. So the question becomes one of how high you can go, how much leverage through your marketing variables you can apply to the business to make it bigger.”
And von Gonten agrees: “I don’t want to go to test market with anything that I don’t know will be a success. And I will use the test market to derive a means to make my product an even bigger success.”
To use the test market to improve the productivity of the marketing plan requires a research design that tests variations in the plan. “There is more to be learned from test marketing than an estimate of trial and repeat. There are the effects of sampling to be learned. There are also the effects of varying levels of promotion to be learned,” Newman explains. 
  
We conducted an informal survey of 25 marketing research executives attending a seminar on test marketing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to learn how they recommend using test markets. These are the results: 



Saint’s experience with “Vaseline Intensive Care” hand lotion illustrates how test markets can improve the productivity of the marketing mix. “We tested in three markets. In two of the markets we went with straight advertising, and in the third market we used a combination of advertising and sampling. The success we found in that third market led us to a national program which used a combination of sampling and advertising.”
However, research designs can be complicated when you are testing several variables in the marketing mix. For example, the famous DuPont test of advertising for cookware coated with “Teflon” used 13 cities to measure the direct and cumulative effects of three levels of television advertising.1 As the number of elements or levels to be tested increases, the number of cities, and therefore the costs of test marketing, increase.
Newman feels that “ideally, you should have a minimum of four cities on each variable,” while Schucker asserts that “you need at least two markets per variable.” Included in these increased costs are the expense of getting distribution in an increased number of cities across the country. Similar problems arise in purchasing advertising.
Marketers who want to use test marketing to test several elements in the marketing mix may want to consider an approach used by Michael von Gonten. This approach uses a single large city as the test site and treats neighborhoods as separate markets. The logistical problems associated with multiple-city tests are therefore greatly reduced. A single-city test may involve only one sales district. Shipping and warehousing costs are thus reduced. Media purchases are simplified.
Another feature of this design is a competitive one. Testing in a single city reduces exposure to competitors and may make it difficult for them to know the nature of the test. Variables under the control of the marketer—such as sampling, couponing, and in-store variations—may work better in this design than media tests because few print and electronic media have split runs within cities.
It is naturally possible to design a test that is too complex. As Fountaine says, “The further you get from reality, the more likely you are to make an error.”
Pearson avers: “You better not do too many different things in test market because, if you do, you are going to confound your purposes.” 
  
How to avoid disaster 
Murphy’s Law is familiar to most businessmen: “If anything can go wrong, it will.” This law is particularly descriptive of the new product development process. Disasters are common in the development and introduction of new products, and test markets are one of the ways to avoid as many disasters as possible.
The following is a partial list of the variety of things that have gone wrong in the development of a new product:

Because packages would not stack, the scouring pads fell off the shelf.


A dog food discolored on the store shelves. 


In cold weather, baby food separated into a clear liquid and a sludge. 


In hot weather, cigarettes in a new package dried out.


A pet food gave the test animals diarrhea.


When it was combined with a price reduction, a product change in a liquid detergent was thought by consumers to be dilution with water. 


 

Because of insufficient glue, over half of the packages came apart during transit. 


Excessive settling in a box of paper tissues caused the box to be one-third empty at purchase. 


A large proportion of samples was not delivered until long after the test.

It is difficult, however, to justify a test market solely as a disaster check. As Pearson points out, “Some people put a lot of emphasis on the fact that a test market is a dry run. My feeling is that it is an awfully expensive dry run.”
How Should You Use Test Data? 
Test marketing’s role is the evaluation of marketing plans. Many researchers caution against two major misuses.
1. Evaluation, not generation or development 
Test marketing is the last step in a process whose goal is a successful product. The “ideal” process begins with the generation of new product ideas and ends with the evaluation of a complete marketing plan. The beginning of this process, as we showed in the exhibit, is designed to generate many ideas with a minimum of evaluation. These ideas are then subjected to a series of screenings using criteria established by corporate policy.
For instance, the first screen in the exhibit is a financial one—a rough profit plan that compares the estimated payout period with the maximum period allowed by corporate policy. Concepts that pass through this screen receive further evaluation as they pass through successive screens during product and communication development. A concept that fails to pass through a screen may be killed, or it may be reevaluated and revised.
The outputs of the product and communication developments should be combined with the marketing strategy to form a complete marketing plan. From this point, the process should be concerned with the evaluation of the plan and some fine-tuning, not with generation or development. 
  
If idea generation and concept development appear at the test market stage, these reflect an unwillingness on the part of management to kill products earlier. A low “kill ratio” early in the screening process indicates that criteria are not stringent enough or that management is overriding them.
Gibson warns: “Test marketing is a big, expensive thing. If your process lets everything get through to test market, you are, by definition, not going to work on many ideas and you are not going to have many successes unless you just happen to have blind, dumb luck. You have to have a process that permits lots of ideas at the beginning that gradually get weeded out.”
The process for product development is not a mechanical one. It is open to inputs from executives with creative spirit. And a creative suggestion may, of course, override a criterion that has been established for a new product policy. It is important to remember, however, that what is needed first is, according to Pearson, a policy that clearly says: 

“No concept that scores below a certain level will proceed to the next step. Just because you have such a policy naturally doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t sometimes bypass it. But at least you should spell out the general rules so you know what you’re bypassing. 
“We should articulate a policy that says, ‘Well, sure, it is all right to bypass the system, but let’s be sure everybody knows what the rules are and accepts the fact that we have made a change. Because somebody has a great insight, a great solution to a great marketing need, we are going to go full steam ahead to test market or even national markets.’ You then preserve your flexibility, but at the same time you don’t let it confuse your system. If most of your ideas go through a systematic process of development and evaluation, then at least you know that you have the odds working for you.”

Why are criteria overridden? The answers seem to be related to differences in reward systems for researchers and product managers.
2. Evaluation of plans, not people 
Product managers tend to say “go” if a product concept does not look bad; researchers want to say “stop” unless it looks good. This difference in philosophy is the result of differences in evaluating product managers and researchers: product managers succeed by having successful products; researchers are expected to prevent costly failures.
McMennamin observes that “because of the pressure to get something into test market, it’s amazing how unconcerned product managers can be going into one. But when negative results start coming in, they get very detailed in their explanations of what’s happening.”
These differences in philosophy come into conflict in the new product development process during the establishment of criteria for evaluation. Researchers would like higher levels for earlier kill. Product managers would like lower levels so that a larger number of products could reach test market. The marketing executive must reconcile these differences by establishing screening criteria consistent with corporate objectives, resources, and opportunities.
In addition to establishing these criteria, marketing executives must establish the policies for overriding them. Researchers agree with the need to override criteria, but they argue that an override should be noted as an exception to the system. This notation protects the researcher from unfair criticism without constraining the product manager’s creative spirit. 
  
In conjunction with other information 
To reiterate a point made earlier, “Test marketing,” says Levine, “should not be used for trying to obtain sales-point estimates in a national market.”
Posner concurs: “Management has regarded test marketing results as point estimates and has not accepted their imprecision. The results should be considered in economic-risk terms.”
“Researchers bring management information which is, at best, qualitative. Management puts it with information it already has and then makes a decision,” concludes Dunn. Management, like navigators, should use more than one source of information when sailing in dangerous waters.
The reality and integrative nature of a test market make it more credible to the executive than any other test procedure. This partially explains why executives focus primarily on test market results without integrating other data. A second reason for relying only on test markets is that it is difficult to assimilate the variety of information and judgments available to the marketing executive. But recently developed simulation models can help the marketing executive in combining information to make new product decisions.
Recent Developments 
The high costs of test marketing—indirect and direct—provide an incentive for developing methods that circumvent this procedure. Laboratory and mathematical simulation models are two developments.
Laboratory simulation 
In this procedure, a sample of consumers is exposed to test commercials and then allowed to shop in a simulated supermarket environment. Demographic, economic, and brand preference data can be obtained prior to the test. Followup interviews after home use measure product satisfaction and intentions to repurchase. These data can then be fed into mathematical models that predict market share.
There are three possible alternatives after the laboratory simulation. First, the product may be killed outright. Second, favorable laboratory simulation results may encourage the marketer to go directly to a regional rollout. Third, the laboratory simulation may be followed by a test market to measure the productivity of the marketing plan, including trade acceptance, to fine-tune the plan, and to serve as a disaster check.
Mathematical market simulation 
Marketing researchers have established relationships among promotional expenditures, awareness, trial, and repeat purchase that are used in mathematical simulations to predict market share. Market share predictions become inputs to the profit plan that estimates the payout period. 
  
Simulation models are used first to develop an initial payout estimate. At this stage in the process, the inputs to the model are executive judgments. Product-test data replace executive judgment in the next estimate of the payout period. The estimate can then be revised again by using the simulation model with data from the extended product-use test and communication tests.
Mathematical simulations complement test marketing in a variety of ways. “They force people to consider the variables with which they are dealing before they go into test market,” says McMennamin. Models can be used to project test market results so that tests can be stopped sooner and they can be used for diagnostics after a test market is completed.
Final Note 
The decision to test market should be made only after the executive has received a complete marketing plan based on comprehensive product and communication tests. Test markets should be conducted to learn about the productivity of the marketing plan in terms of both consumer and trade response, to learn ways to improve the productivity of the plan, and to avoid potential disasters. The results of the test market should be used to evaluate the marketing plan, not to generate additional ideas, and not for the evaluation of people.
Executives play a major role in the new product development process by establishing levels of criteria for evaluation and policies for overriding these levels. These levels and policies are part of the mechanism by which executives control the new product development process.

Product marketing is the process of promoting and selling a product to an audience. Product marketing, as opposed to product management, deals with more outbound marketing or customer-facing tasks (in the older sense of the phrase). For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as marketing communications ("marcom"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product.
A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.

Role[edit]
Product marketing in a Business addresses four important strategic questions:[1]

What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)?
Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)?
How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)?
At what price should the products be offered?

To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the rest of the product team and company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of—and driving—customer engagement with the product, throughout their lifecycle (pre-adoption, post adoption/purchase, and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through customer surveys and interviews, and when available, product usage data. This frequently informs the future product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to ensure improved engagement.
PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods:

Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation
Data analysis: product marketing managers are highly quantitative, particularly in internet companies where results of marketing attribution to revenue is easily measured
Product validation: particularly for internet companies, teams often use marketing as a channel to test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before engineering resources are committed to develop the product
Testing: optimal prices and marketing touch points are developed through exhaustive A/B testing of language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals, and more

Comparison with product management[edit]
Product marketing frequently differs from product management in high-tech companies. Whereas the product manager is required to take a product's requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD),[2] which will be used by the engineering team to build the product, the product marketing manager can be engaged in the task of creating a market requirements document (MRD), which is used as source for the product management to develop the PRD.
In other companies the product manager creates both the MRDs and the PRDs, while the product marketing manager does outbound tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows, creating marketing collateral like hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets, and white papers. This requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis, market research, and technical writing, but also in more business oriented activities like conducting ROI and NPV analyses on technology investments, strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the company's product vis-a-vis the competitor's product, etc.
One issue that faces Product Marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents (sales, marcom, customers, blogs, etc.). Creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content.
In smaller high-tech firms or start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market, influence the "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing. In Silicon Valley, in particular, product marketing professionals have considerable domain experience in a particular market or technology or both. Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.
The trend that is emerging in Silicon Valley is for companies to hire a team of a product marketing manager with a technical marketing manager. The Technical marketing role is becoming more valuable as companies become more competitive and seek to reduce costs and time to market. Another trend is to have one Product Marketing Manager per group of Product Managers. This is the model that leads to the issue of PMMs being pressured to write content instead of connecting with the market.
In health care marketing products are rarely purchased by the end user and are often purchased or paid for by government, intermediaries, payors, healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as a result in the Biotech/Pharmaceutical and Medical Device markets there are "6" P's; the core 4: Price, Product, Promotion and Positioning as well as: Politics and Perception.
Conferences for product marketing[edit]
Product marketing-specific conferences are hard to come by, though several have emerged recently.

Product Marketing Summit - An annual, all-virtual conference that's free for a limited time. The Summit features speakers and interviews with product marketers from companies like Salesforce, Uber, Zendesk, Evernote, Google, etc. The Summit also has an active product marketing blog and email newsletter.
Product Marketing Community - Physical events in Toronto, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.

Qualifications[edit]
The typical education qualification for this area of business is a high level Marketing or Business related degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, not forgetting sufficient work experience in related areas. As a key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, a background in engineering or computing is also an asset, given the highly quantitative component of the role.

Product marketing is the process of promoting and selling a product to an audience. Product marketing, as opposed to product management, deals with more outbound marketing or customer-facing tasks (in the older sense of the phrase). For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as marketing communications ("marcom"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product.
A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.

Role[edit]
Product marketing in a Business addresses four important strategic questions:[1]

What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)?
Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)?
How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)?
At what price should the products be offered?

To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the rest of the product team and company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of—and driving—customer engagement with the product, throughout their lifecycle (pre-adoption, post adoption/purchase, and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through customer surveys and interviews, and when available, product usage data. This frequently informs the future product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to ensure improved engagement.
PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods:

Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation
Data analysis: product marketing managers are highly quantitative, particularly in internet companies where results of marketing attribution to revenue is easily measured
Product validation: particularly for internet companies, teams often use marketing as a channel to test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before engineering resources are committed to develop the product
Testing: optimal prices and marketing touch points are developed through exhaustive A/B testing of language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals, and more

Comparison with product management[edit]
Product marketing frequently differs from product management in high-tech companies. Whereas the product manager is required to take a product's requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD),[2] which will be used by the engineering team to build the product, the product marketing manager can be engaged in the task of creating a market requirements document (MRD), which is used as source for the product management to develop the PRD.
In other companies the product manager creates both the MRDs and the PRDs, while the product marketing manager does outbound tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows, creating marketing collateral like hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets, and white papers. This requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis, market research, and technical writing, but also in more business oriented activities like conducting ROI and NPV analyses on technology investments, strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the company's product vis-a-vis the competitor's product, etc.
One issue that faces Product Marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents (sales, marcom, customers, blogs, etc.). Creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content.
In smaller high-tech firms or start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market, influence the "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing.

Conferences for product marketing[edit]
Product marketing-specific conferences are hard to come by, though several have emerged recently.

Product Marketing Summit - An annual, all-virtual conference that's free for a limited time. The Summit features speakers and interviews with product marketers from companies like Salesforce, Uber, Zendesk, Evernote, Google, etc. The Summit also has an active product marketing blog and email newsletter.
Product Marketing Community - Physical events in Toronto, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.

Qualifications[edit]
The typical education qualification for this area of business is a high level Marketing or Business related degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, not forgetting sufficient work experience in related areas. As a key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, a background in engineering or computing is also an asset, given the highly quantitative component of the role.

Product marketing is the process of promoting and selling a product to an audience. Product marketing, as opposed to product management, deals with more outbound marketing or customer-facing tasks (in the older sense of the phrase). For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as marketing communications ("marcom"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product.
A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.

Role[edit]
Product marketing in a Business addresses four important strategic questions:[1]

What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)?
Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)?
How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)?
At what price should the products be offered?

To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the rest of the product team and company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of—and driving—customer engagement with the product, throughout their lifecycle (pre-adoption, post adoption/purchase, and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through customer surveys and interviews, and when available, product usage data. This frequently informs the future product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to ensure improved engagement.
PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods:

Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation
Data analysis: product marketing managers are highly quantitative, particularly in internet companies where results of marketing attribution to revenue is easily measured
Product validation: particularly for internet companies, teams often use marketing as a channel to test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before engineering resources are committed to develop the product
Testing: optimal prices and marketing touch points are developed through exhaustive A/B testing of language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals, and more

Comparison with product management[edit]
Product marketing frequently differs from product management in high-tech companies. Whereas the product manager is required to take a product's requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD),[2] which will be used by the engineering team to build the product, the product marketing manager can be engaged in the task of creating a market requirements document (MRD), which is used as source for the product management to develop the PRD.
In other companies the product manager creates both the MRDs and the PRDs, while the product marketing manager does outbound tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows, creating marketing collateral like hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets, and white papers. This requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis, market research, and technical writing, but also in more business oriented activities like conducting ROI and NPV analyses on technology investments, strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the company's product vis-a-vis the competitor's product, etc.
One issue that faces Product Marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents (sales, marcom, customers, blogs, etc.). Creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content.
In smaller high-tech firms or start-ups, product marketing and product management functions can be blurred, and both tasks may be borne by one individual. However, as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team, whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market, influence the "analysts", and understand longer term market direction. When such clear demarcation becomes visible, the former falls under the domain of product management, and the latter, under product marketing. In Silicon Valley, in particular, product marketing professionals have considerable domain experience in a particular market or technology or both. Some Silicon Valley firms have titles such as Product Marketing Engineer.
The trend that is emerging in Silicon Valley is for companies to hire a team of a product marketing manager with a technical marketing manager. The Technical marketing role is becoming more valuable as companies become more competitive and seek to reduce costs and time to market. Another trend is to have one Product Marketing Manager per group of Product Managers. This is the model that leads to the issue of PMMs being pressured to write content instead of connecting with the market.
In health care marketing products are rarely purchased by the end user and are often purchased or paid for by government, intermediaries, payors, healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as a result in the Biotech/Pharmaceutical and Medical Device markets there are "6" P's; the core 4: Price, Product, Promotion and Positioning as well as: Politics and Perception.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
