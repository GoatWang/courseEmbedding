              can I buy a replacement top piece for a 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             Yes the top of the 6208 ladder is replaceable. In order to determine which top will fit your model of ladder, we would also need the mark number (MK) on the ladder. This number can be found on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If your MK is 12,13,14,15,16, or 17, you would need to order the 38-31. If your MK is 18 you would nee 38-32. If the MK on your ladder is not one of the MK's I have listed above, then we do not have a top for your model of ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-07-17                What is the warrantee on this ladder?                     What is the time and coverage if it has a warrantee at all , as I can find no reference to one anywhere?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does not offer a written or implied warranty on its products. We do stand behind the quality and workmanship of our models. Issues of this nature would usually become evident within the first 6 to 12 months of ownership.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-12-02                Product weight of 6208 ladder           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6208 step ladder weighs 30 pounds.

How tall will the ladder be when closed? How deep is it?         Asked by: Anonymous             When in the closed position the length of the ladder is 96 3/4&quot;. The depth is 5 1/4&quot;.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-11-20                What is the cold weather rating on your fiberglass ladders with plastic top           Asked by: Anonymous             The plastic tops on the fiberglass step ladders are tested to a temperature of -20&deg; F. This requirement is set in place per ANSI standards.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-10-24                What is overall height of 8 foot step ladder when fully spread and in use?           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6208 stands 92.25&quot; tall when fully opened.

Thank you for your inquiry.

Can I get a replacement sticker from you?         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co. does offer replacement safety label kits and duty rating label kits. These kits may be special ordered through your local distributors. Please provide the distributor with your model number and they can special order the correct kits for your unit.

However, when fully set up for use the ladder stands at 92-1/4 inches, or 7 feet 8-1/4 inches tall. When using the ladder, it will be set up below your ceilings, but you may have some difficulty when getting the ladder in position for use.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.

Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Building SuppliesWhen building, no matter how small or supersized the structure, if the supplies and tools used in the construction aren't right the building isn't going to turn out to be the monument expected. Instead, it'll only display a shoddiness that might just be unsafe. Because of this, don't cut corners during the planning process. Have the right items, from flooring materials to attic vents, and build better.

Amazon.com's Building Supplies Store has those products every contractor and builder needs, starting with the essential building materials for a variety of spaces: ceiling medallions, ceramic tiles, glass tiles and stone tiles, corbels, flooring materials, moldings and trims, exterior doors, fence post caps, gutter parts and accessories, wood flooring, and attic vents. Moving from materials to constructing, don't forget the necessary rough plumbing items like food disposers, water heaters, water pumps, and toilet parts, electrical essentials and tools like dimmers, door chimes and bells, extension cords, tools and testers, power strips, recessed lighting, switches and outlets, and wall plates, and weather vanes.

There's no need when thinking about moving materials to stress about the bodily wear and tear, however, because we offer handling products, too, such as dollies, drywall lifts, forklifts, hand trucks, lifting straps, lift tables, pallet trucks, pallets, platform trucks, roller stands, service carts, tie-downs, and winches, hoists, and pulleys. And for reaching those second floor and elevated building situations, don't show up without a reliable stepladder, extension ladder, emergency ladder, telescoping ladder, or multiple ladders, and for longer term jobs, some sturdy scaffolding.

In the same way that using weak materials or unhelpful tools is a sure step towards disaster, using a less-than-dependable brand is a bad idea. Shop top brands like 2x4basics, 3M, Cramer, Filtrete, Honeywell, JET, Kidde, Louisville Ladder, Lux, Magna Cart, and Werner and start building with a leg already up. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. There won't be a building job in the world you'll back down from finishing.
