Premium Outdoor Volleyball Net Systems and Accessories

 

Park and Sun Sports Volleyball Net Systems Battle Tested, Tournament Ready!
Over 30 years ago, Park and Sun Sports redefined outdoor volleyball net systems when they developed and introduced the Spectrum volleyball net series, with lightweight telescoping air-craft aluminum volleyball poles.

Park and Sun Sports did not stop there! They reinvented the traditional volleyball net with their volleyball sleeve net design and colorful net tapes. The slip-on net design distributed even net tension without the aid of bungee cords. And over 30 years later you will find it hard to go to a park, beach or volleyball tournament without seeing a Park and Sun Sports net system. 
Park and Sun Sports is the official volleyball net supplier to some of the nation's top volleyball tournaments and leagues:
          		Emerald Coast Volleyball, Motherlode Volleyball Classic, Pottstown Rumble, United States Youth Volleyball League, Volleyball of the Rockies, Volley America, Waupaca Boatride Volleyball Tournament...

To make your shopping experience at Unique-Sports.com the easiest possible, when it says "free shipping", we have a single price - and that’s all you pay (unless you want it a bit faster...and we make that easy too!) Other stores may have similar prices, but once you add the hidden costs like extra shipping "options", handling, taxes and more, you’ll find that no sporting equipment shopping experience is quite like ours.
Orders on in stock merchandise that are received before 12:00pm Central Standard Time will be fulfilled within the same day.  Most orders will be delivered within 7 business days from the date of shipping.  Weekends and Holidays are excluded.  Most orders are shipped UPS Ground, which is free of charge. 
Free Shipping is a big part of what makes your shopping experience here UNIQUE!

    Park & Sun                    




Park & Sun Sports has a distinguished heritage as a sporting goods designer and supplier, and they reaffirm their dedication to the industry with commitment to innovation and quality. They have designed and supplied high quality, recreational sporting goods equipment for 20 years. Their true pride reveals itself in their investment and contribution to the future of sports and their belief in the quality and integrity of their products. Their philosophy is focused on providing unique, quality products and excellent service to their loyal clientele. If it's not Park & Sun, it's not sports. In 2001 Park & Sun was an SGMA Member Heroes Award Honoree. Presented by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, Park & Sun Sports was honored for the company's dedication to the growth of volleyball, their involvement and support of numerous tournaments and fund raisers, and their continued support of youth volleyball through the United States Youth Volleyball League. Park & Sun Sports has also established itself as the number ONE name for anything and everything volleyball, as they continually revolutionize the sport with their advancements in product technology (as can be found on the Spectrum Classic) and quality that are simply unmatched. Park & Sun is recognized as being the 1st to introduce colored nets to the volleyball industry. They have also shown innovation with their "slip-on sleeve net" featured on the Spectrum Classic, and use of aircraft aluminum materials in the poles. The new telescopic, push-button pole system on the Park & Sun Spectrum Volleyball Set is the most recent addition to their ever-expanding list of "firsts" within the volleyball industry.

Runners and bikers can get their exercise in and around their neighborhood, but sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate. That's why having your own equipment makes it possible for you to exercise anytime day or night without worry about getting too hot or too cold. When buying exercise equipment, there are some things to know before making these big-ticket purchases. Treadmills One of the main considerations regarding a treadmill is how much space it takes up. A typical treadmill is about 6.5 feet long and 3 feet wide. For those with limited space, a treadmill that folds up is ideal, and some can fold up so thin that they fit under a bed when not in use. Another consider is stride length. Some treadmills have a long deck area that is dedicated to running while some have design cues that limit the running space. Treadmills should have a high degree of adjustability to be the most useful to you. This includes speeds that should range between 0 and 10 to 12 miles per hour and incline grades of around 10 to 15 percent. Some upgrades to look for on treadmills includes a dock for iPods or MP3 players, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and USB ports. elliptical Trainers For a complete workout, consider an elliptical trainer. Similar to a treadmill, an elliptical trainer takes up a decent amount of space. Ellipticals usually run about 6 feet long but can be 7 feet long and between 2.5 and 4 feet wide. Because of the stepping action that is part of using an elliptical, you should know that elliptical trainers have step-up heights of between 6 and 25 inches above the floor. Having adjustable cushioned handgrips is a nice addition, making sure the user is comfortable, and allowing users of different heights to use it. For multi-taskers, you want to look for certain high-tech features for the equipment to have, such as USB ports, Web access, Bluetooth connectivity and the ability to link to a mobile device. The elliptical trainer should offer several programs to keep your workout interesting, such as hill climbing, long-distance climbs and one that targets a specific heart rate. Exercise Bikes Comfort is probably the most important consideration when choosing an exercise (or stationary) bicycle. The saddle should be padded and designed in a manner of your choosing. Some users like a wide saddle and some like a long, narrow saddle. Adjustable handlebars are features that also add to a user's comfort. Weight capacity is another consideration as some lightweight bikes only hold up to 250 pounds while some can hold users of 350 pounds or more. These bikes can be either belt-driven or chain-driven models and should be quiet when operating. Like elliptical machines and treadmills, stationary bikes have built-in programs that allow users to vary their workouts and keep them from becoming tedious. You also want to look for bikes that have heart-rate monitors, computer screens that display your statistics as you ride and adjustable tension levels. Rowing Machines Rowing machines come in four different styles: air, hydraulic, magnetic and water. All simulate the rowing action of a canoe or kayak in the water. Air rowing machines use flywheels (similar to elliptical machines) to create resistance. Hydraulic machines use cylinders filled with oil to create resistance. Magnets provide the resistance in magnetic rowing machines, and water pressure provides the resistance in water rowing machines. The seat should be comfortable and can either be a saddle or have a back connected to it. Some rowing machines are fixed while some are foldable, which is a consideration for those with limited space. One thing to note is that fixed machines tend to be more durable for frequent home use than folding rowers. Home Gyms Home gyms make it possible for users to perform many different weight resistance exercises all with one machine in a small space. Some home gyms use free weights   purchased separately   to provide resistance while others come with the weights attached to the gym. An adjustable bench that detaches is useful for doing several different exercises either seated or lying down. Some gyms that come preloaded with weights have the ability to add more, making them useful to people looking to increase their strength levels. There should be a number of accessories as well, such as a pull-down bar, lat bar, dumbbell and leg lift.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313233, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.

To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?
